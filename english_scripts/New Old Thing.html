  Todd:
 </strong>
 What&#39;s the last cool thing you bought at a flea market?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  I bought an old, vintage style radio but that wasn&#39;t at a flea market. The last cool thing I bought at a flea market? Well, I kind of went to a ... it was like a flea market. I mean, kids on the university campus were selling their old clothes and stuff and I got this very nice winter jacket for about 50 cents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  50 cents?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah. It&#39;s right there. That one. It&#39;s green.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a nice jacket!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I like the price. Like, they said, &#34;nope&#34; - 75 cents - too much. 25 cents - too cheap. Now did you actually haggle for 50 cents?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  No, now that jacket was actually that price, but some other kids
  <span class="audionotes">
   at a different spot
  </span>
  on the same site were doing a game where you
  <span class="audionotes">
   shoot down things
  </span>
  with this kind of play gun and get points and then depending on how many points you got, you could choose from a different group of stuff. So, I was shooting for a CD-Stereo, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   I ended up only getting
  </span>
  a jacket and and a hat and some accessories like a watch and a necklace. Yeah, so that was kind of disappointing cause I ended up walking away with
  <span class="audionotes">
   a bunch of stuff
  </span>
  I didn&#39;t want or need. That was good
  <span class="audionotes">
   on their behalf
  </span>
  . I thought that was good
  <span class="audionotes">
   sales tactic
  </span>
  , cause I thought I was playing a game and I was enjoying shooting stuff down and getting points but then I realized I was acquiring these things I didn&#39;t need.
