   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So, Trina, Monday is Valentine&#39;s day. Are you
  <span class="audionotes">
   excited
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  No!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  That was a pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   direct
  </span>
  answer. Why are you not excited? It&#39;s a holiday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a holiday for people that have other people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So, you&#39;re not happy because you don&#39;t have other people?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  I have other people. I have my sister and my mom and my dad and my friends, but Valentine&#39;s day is more of a holiday for people that have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, or a wife, or a husband, or children
  <span class="audionotes">
   as opposed to
  </span>
  being a single person with nobody to share it with.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  But could you share it with your sister, or your mother, or your father?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  I could. I could, and we do. We send each other gifts. We, well this year, I won&#39;t be with anybody, but I get to celebrate it with my sister this weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Well, that
  <span class="audionotes">
   sounds fun
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  It is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So what kinds of things have you done on Valentines day in the past?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  Ah, gone out to dinner, gone to a movie, had dinner at my parents house, had dinner at my grandparent&#39;s house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s interesting. Why your grandparent&#39;s house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  It was their wedding
  <span class="audionotes">
   anniversary
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s a great day to have a wedding anniversary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  It is and it was a lot of fun. I got to spend some of their last few years together having dinner with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  That sounds lovely. So are you looking forward to maybe having a Valentine next year?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  Maybe! We&#39;ll, see.
