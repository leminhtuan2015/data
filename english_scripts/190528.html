President Trump disagreed with his host, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, at a news conference in Tokyo on Monday and the U.S. president said North Korea's recent missile tests did not violate a U.N. Security Council resolution.
<br><br>
AP's Ben Thomas reports.
<br><br>
"I am very happy with the way it's going.  And intelligent people agree with me."
"
You're not bothered at all by the small missiles?"
<br><br>
"No, I'm not.  I am personally not."
<br><br>
At a joint news conference in Tokyo, President Trump broke with his host with his assessment of North Korea's recent short-range missile tests.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the tests "a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions" and said they were "of great regret," while acknowledging his own adviser's share of Abe's view, President Trump downplayed the tests.
<br><br>
"I view it as a man - perhaps he wants to get attention."
<br><br>
Praising North Korea leader Kim Jong Un as a "smart man," Trump predicted "someday we'll have a deal.  I'm not in a rush."

Ukraine's new President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made his first visit to eastern Ukraine, a frontline of the war between Ukrainian troops and Russia-backed separatists.
<br><br>
Zelenskiy, who took the oath of office earlier this month, campaigned on the promise that he would focus on ending the violence in eastern Ukraine.
<br><br>
During Monday's visit, which was not announced ahead of time, Zelenskiy met with Ukrainian troops in the Luhansk region.  His media team said he spoke with soldiers about living conditions, equipment and staffing needs.
<br><br>
Zelenskiy's predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, was a frequent visitor to the frontlines of the fighting.  Zelenskiy, a comedian, who had only ever played a president on television before, won a landslide victory over Poroshenko last month.
<br><br>
He took office May the 20th.

A study suggests e-cigarette flavorings may pose a heart risk.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Mike Gracia reports.
<br><br>
A new study suggests flavorings in e-cigarettes may be bad for the heart.
<br><br>
Researchers at Stanford University's cardiovascular institute report they grew cells that normally line healthy human blood vessels in laboratory dishes.  The cells were exposed to six different e-cigarette flavorings.  Cells bathed in blood taken from people right after they had an e-cigarette were also tested.
<br><br>
The study found vaping and some flavorings even without nicotine triggered blood vessel dysfunction.
<br><br>
The report appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

Former Major League baseball player Bill Buckner has died.  He was 69.
<br><br>
The AP's Ed Donahue reports.
<br><br>
Buckner won a National League batting title, but his legacy was changed in the 1986 World Series.  Playing first base for the Red Sox, Game Six was tied.  The Red Sox were victory away from their first world championship since 1918.  But a ground ball went Buckner's way.  The ball went though Buckner's legs.  The New York Mets won the game and eventually won the World Series.
<br><br>
Red Sox fans were not quick to forget.  But in 2008, Buckner accepted an invitation to throw out the first ball for the home opener at Fenway Park as the Red Sox celebrated winning the 2007 World Series.  There were loud cheers.
<br><br>
He said the moment was "probably about as emotional as it could get."
<br><br>
Bill Buckner died after a long battle with dementia.

U.S. citizens observed the Memorial Day holiday Monday, holding ceremonies to honor members of the military who lost their lives in service to the country.
<br><br>
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visited Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider and remind Americans of what purpose the holiday serves.
<br><br>
"As is evident by all you're present here by Gatherings like this all across America, you know there is a day in November when we remember those who served in came home, but today is the day when all across America we paused honor and remember those who served our nation but did not come home.  It is Memorial Day in America."
<br><br>
Memorial Day is often observed for solemn public events but it's also seen as a day of recreation when family and friends gather to barbecue, play sports and reserve what is seen as the unofficial start to the summer season.
