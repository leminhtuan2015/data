  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, we&#39;re here... first of all, how about everybody introduce themselves.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  OK. I&#39;m Fred from Canada and it&#39;s a pleasure to be here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Hello. I am Katerina. I&#39;m from Mexico and I&#39;m also very glad to be here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Thanks guys. And then, I&#39;m Todd. I&#39;m from the U.S. Now for the listeners, we all live really close to each other and we live in a neighborhood, where I guess, all of our houses are probably within two or three minutes of each other.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Very close.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, we thought we would talk about the neighborhood, and the first topic would be the
  <span class="audionotes">
   stray cats
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Which are also are neighbors.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. First of all, how many stray cats do you think there are in the neighborhood?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  At least at night, you see them all together, especially in one corner, and I see at least about six cats, at least, all together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  I would say much more than that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I would too actually. How many do you think?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  I would go for maybe twenty of those around the neighborhood.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  But
  <span class="audionotes">
   this is just one corner
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  OK, just one corner, so multiplied by four or five corners, yeah, twenty, twenty-five cats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so then, what do you guys think about the cats? Like should something be done about the cats? Should the people feed the cats?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  I think especially for a lot of the elderly people that live here, I think for them
  <span class="audionotes">
   it&#39;s very nice to have the cats around
  </span>
  and they feed them and I think as long as they don&#39;t go into the trash, I think it&#39;s OK, but for me, I haven&#39;t seen any trash, and I don&#39;t think it would be a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, you know, they break into my house. I don&#39;t know if they break into yours, but they&#39;re amazing. If I don&#39;t lock the windows, the sliding glass doors they pull the door open with their paw and they come in and they look through my trash and then they leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Those are very clever cats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I thought it was a raccoon. I thought I had a raccoon, and I went to talk to my
  <span class="audionotes">
   landlady
  </span>
  , and she&#39;s like, &#34;No, that&#39;s just the cats.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  I think you were just not feeding them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, yeah, I guess that&#39;s it. Like, they&#39;re so hungry that they break into people&#39;s houses for food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  OK, I don&#39;t have that problem. I live on the third floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  So, maybe that&#39;s why.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t have that problem either, although I do live in a house similar to yours, Todd, where we live on the first floor and there is a lot of stray cats around the neighborhood but
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;ve never had any problems
  </span>
  of them breaking into the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I don&#39;t know. They&#39;re pretty amazing. Like, I did not even know that cat&#39;s could break into a house, but they can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Very smart cats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Or very hungry cats, as you said.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Or friendly cats. They want to visit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, right.
 </p>
