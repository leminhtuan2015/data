The U.S. Justice Department is dismissing House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler's subpoena demanding an unredacted copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
<br><br>
As AP's Sagar Meghani reports, Nadler wants Congress to get the report before Attorney General Bill Barr testifies next month.

<br><br>
"... Congress to pursue that, to pursue that."

Robert Berger was on hand in Jerusalem as worshippers carried out an ancient holy land tradition.
<br><br>
Jerusalem was awash with thousands of pilgrims marching through the narrow cobblestone alleyways of the Via Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrows, in Jerusalem's Old City.  Some carried big wooden crosses on their shoulders.  They sang hymns and read Scriptures during the traditional Good Friday Procession, retracing the path of Jesus to the 14 Stations of the Cross.
<br><br>
Israeli police and soldiers armed with assault rifles guarded the route, but the atmosphere was calm.

Meanwhile, Parisians gave thanks Friday that Notre-Dame cathedral still stands.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Mike Gracia reports.
<br><br>
On a Good Friday unlike any other in Paris, there were prayers and thanks that the iconic Notre-Dame cathedral still stands.  A fire four days earlier burned through the cathedral's vaulted stone ceiling but miraculously the structure was saved.
<br><br>
French authorities say although it was fierce, the fire Monday evening was concentrated on the cathedral's roof and the priceless works inside Notre-Dame suffered no major damage.
<br><br>
The structure was declared stabilized Friday.  The reconstruction of Notre-Dame is expected to take several years.
