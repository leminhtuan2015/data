   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Alexandra you were talking about a hurricane. What hurricane were you talking about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  I was talking about Hurricane Andrew, and as I said before, it was a category 5 hurricane. I was not in the city when it
  <span class="audiodef">
   came through
  </span>
  , however I did come back about 24 hours later and the difference in the city was amazing. I was driving down in the morning and it was before sunrise. There was no lights south of maybe Brower county, which is the next county north of Miami. It was dark. Normally when you travel on a highway, there&#39;s lights on either side. There&#39;s lights of the city,the buildings, the waterways. Everythings lit. It&#39;s very strange to drive down a city with the only lights being from your car and as I was getting closer to where I lived, there was no lights. You had to be careful. There were things in the street. We even had friends who kept driving past the street where they lived but didn&#39;t
  <span class="audiodef">
   recognize
  </span>
  it because everything had changed. There was, all the
  <span class="audiodef">
   markers
  </span>
  , the trees, buildings, had completely either been demolished, or just weren&#39;t there anymore. So I had one friend pass his street 3 times before he
  <span class="audiodef">
   realized
  </span>
  it was his street, so yeah, a lot of destruction, a lot of people were
  <span class="audiodef">
   in shock
  </span>
  .
