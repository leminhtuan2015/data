Zimbabwe is retrieving and burying bodies as Mozambique begins three days of national mourning for the victims of a cyclone.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Charles De Ledesma reports that aid has begun arriving in the region among the early responders, India.
<br><br>
<br><br>
The full number of cyclone victims and the extent of the damage done will only be known when torrential floodwaters recede.  Persistent rains are forecast so it will be days before the plains of Mozambique drain toward the Indian Ocean.
<br><br>
Zimbabwe's president will visit the hard-hit mountain community on the eastern border with Mozambique.  Officials say some 300 people may have died in Zimbabwe as a result of the floods.
<br><br>
Mozambican officials say its death toll is 200 and rising.  A reporter earlier in the week predicted the full number to be more like 1,000.

The U.S. special representative for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, has been meeting in Rome for talks on the political crisis in the South American country.
<br><br>
Correspondent Sabina Castelfranco reporting for VOA says while the talks were inconclusive, there are suggestions they were fruitful.
<br><br>
Following a meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, Abrams said, "We did not come to a meeting of the minds, but the talks were positive in the sense that I think both sides emerged with a better understanding of the other's views."  The two sides remain at odds over the legitimacy of Venezuelan President Nichol&aacute;s Maduro.
<br><br>
The United States has recognized self-declared President Juan Guaid&oacute; as Venezuela's legitimate leader, while Russia continues to recognize Mr. Maduro.

The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. says climate change is not the world's biggest environmental threat.  That came as news to many people in the world's scientific community.
<br><br>
AP Washington correspondent Shelley Adler reports.
<br><br>
The battle over the environment continues, with EPA Andrew Wheeler telling CBS News that climate change is "an important issue" but he adds most of the threats it poses are "50 to 75 years out."
<br><br>
Chris Field runs for the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.  "It is true that if we don't do anything, we'll face catastrophic risks 50 years from now.  But the time to address those catastrophic risks 50 years from now is today.  If we wait even five years, it's too late."
<br><br>
Other climate scientists see the necessity for broad and immediate action to address global warming and the U.N. says "now is the defining moment to do something about it."
<br><br>

President Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that tariffs on China are likely to remain in place for a while even if a trade deal is reached.

<br><br>
He said of China, "They've had a lot of problems living by certain deals."
