U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the United States plans to jointly host a global summit focused on the Middle East, particularly Iran, next month in Poland.
<br><br>
Pompeo told Fox News that the meeting would focus on the Middle East stability and peace and freedom and security, and it would include an important element of making sure Iran is not a destabilizing influence.
<br><br>
"We are very hopeful that we will get the bad actors in the region, the Russians and the Iranians, to come to the table along with the regime and all the other stakeholders, they come to the table and have conversations about what a post-civil war political structure might look like in Syria."
<br><br>
Pompeo is in the middle of an eight-day trip through the region and said the United States is re-doubling its efforts to put pressure on Iran.  He sought to convince allies in the region that the United States is committed to fighting Islamic State despite President Trump's recent decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the withdrawal from Syria is getting underway but at least for now, it does not involve 2,000 U.S. troops on the ground.
<br><br>
A defense official told VOA Friday that equipment, not troops, is moving in the initial stage of that pullout.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the U.N.'s refugee agency said that some [2,000 gr] 2,000 people, that is, remain in Hajin, the last enclave of the Islamic State group in eastern Syria.  UNHCR spokesperson Andre Mahecic said those fleeing reported increasingly desperate conditions.
<br><br>
"It is estimated right now that some 2,000 people remain in the conflict-affected area of Hajin.  Those fleeing report increasingly desperate conditions, diminishing services and extremely high prices of basic foods.  We are worried for civilians who continue to be trapped in ISIS-held areas."
<br><br>
Mahecic said more than 8,000 people had been displaced.
