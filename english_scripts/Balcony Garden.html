  Mike
 </strong>
 : So Dusty, you told me that you tend to grow your own kind of plants and things, and you&#39;re into kind of
 <span class="audionotes">
  greenery
 </span>
 and into kind of like ecology.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : You
  <span class="audionotes">
   grow your own plants
  </span>
  on your balcony, is that right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Right, yeah. Well, you know, I live in Tokyo, and the balcony gets a lot of sunlight. It was actually a pretty good growing season, so we grow a lot of herbs on our balcony, like basil, thyme, mint, or lemongrass. They grow quite well. Even coriander, we have growing right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s just going well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : So you use that stuff for your own cooking and everything, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah. You can really see the difference, especially when you&#39;re making sauces and things. It just has a lot more flavor to it. We&#39;ve also started growing some vegetables, so we&#39;ve got carrots going, and we&#39;ve got lettuce. We&#39;re going to start doing grapes in about a month or so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow! You must have a huge balcony.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : We are lucky. We got a pretty big balcony, but it doesn&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   take much room
  </span>
  . And even some things you would never expect, like goya or grapes grow well on the balcony.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : And it&#39;s like good-
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : I always thought goya was like a tropical kind of vegetable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : It will do okay in Tokyo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah. And then the grapes, you know, the grape quality isn&#39;t very good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : But during the summer, they have leaves, and so it kind of cools down your balcony. In then in the winter, the leaves drop away, so you still get a lot of sunlight. It&#39;s kind of a very
  <span class="audionotes">
   eco-friendly
  </span>
  way of cooling your house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : So what advice would you give to somebody if they wanted to, let&#39;s say, grow their own vegetables or herbs, or whatever, on their balcony?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Well for one thing, don&#39;t be scared to stack things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty:
  </strong>
  Yeah. If you don&#39;t have much room, it&#39;s okay to kind of build a little shelf above one. Herbs don&#39;t need a ton of sunlight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Oh, really? Okay. Wow, I didn&#39;t know that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : So you&#39;ll be fine with that. And then also, grow things you&#39;re actually going to use. Like last year, we grew jalapeno peppers, and we grew habaneros.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Habaneros are great. We&#39;ve got tons of them, but we just couldn&#39;t eat them. It was so spicy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah. In the end, we eventually deep fried some of them and had like cheese poppers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : You mean, you eat them like deep-fried, all straight habanero peppers?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Deep fried with cheese inside. But yeah, that was about the only way we could do it. And even just
  <span class="audionotes">
   handling
  </span>
  them, like your eyes would hurt afterwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other thing is be ready for bugs. Even if you&#39;re up like eight storeys or nine storeys, you&#39;ll be amazed how many - you&#39;ll wake up one morning and just find your plants covered in caterpillars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow! I guess so. I mean, in fact, that makes sense. Insects fly, so they would eventually get themselves up there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Thanks a lot, Dusty. That&#39;s really interesting - fascinating stuff.
