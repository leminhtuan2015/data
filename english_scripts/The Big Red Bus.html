   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Steven, you&#39;re looking at a picture. Please
  <span class="audionotes">
   describe
  </span>
  what you see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  I can see a red double-decker bus
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
  It&#39;s the kind of bus you&#39;ll see very often in London. In fact, I know this bus is from London because I can see the names: Chelsea, Sloane Square, Victoria, Charing Cross. These are all areas in London.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Obviously,
  </span>
  the bus is in London.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Have you ever been on a
  <span class="audionotes">
   double-decker bus
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah, many times. When I was younger, you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really? How much is the fare?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   it depends on
  </span>
  the journey. It&#39;s..I guess it&#39;s not too expensive but the minimum price you would pay is -- for a short journey is about a pound.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, who can you see on the bus? Can you
  <span class="audionotes">
   pick out
  </span>
  anybody on the bus who looks interesting?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  This girl here at the back that&#39;s leaning on the door, she looks really bored actually. Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn&#39;t want to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Is that how you feel on the bus?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  No, not really because I haven&#39;t worked in England for a long time so I haven&#39;t taken a bus for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So,  you&#39;re British, do you missing them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yes, sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Great. Thanks a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  No problem.
