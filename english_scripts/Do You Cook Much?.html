  : So Hana, tell me, do you cook much?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yes, I always cook. I often cook with my roommate, and we always make Chinese of Japanese food. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well, I don’t really cook that often.  I’m really busy during the week. So, I always just get something at the shop and get that. But, during the weekends, I always cook during the weekends because I really like making food. That’s what I do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : So, do you ever eat out?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Only occasionally, because I’m really busy during the week, and I prefer cooking, so not really often. I don’t go out really often to eat. Whenever I’m tired, and I don’t have time to cook during the week, I go and eat out with a friend, so! And you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Well, I always , so I normally go and eat out during the weekend with my friends or family.
