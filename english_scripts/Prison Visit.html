   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Mark, you&#39;ve travelled quite a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  I have, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you&#39;ve actually done a lot of unique things that people don&#39;t do when they travel. You were saying that when you travel you like to look at prisons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. I have
  <span class="audionotes">
   a strange fascination
  </span>
  with prisons when I go traveling.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Is it your conscience
  </span>
  ? Do you feel guilty that you should be in prison?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Not really, no but I don&#39;t know why but the history of prisons is fantastic. For example, obviously the most famous one&#39;s Alcatraz.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  You go there. Now you can take an audio tour. Have you ever taken that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know, I&#39;m from San Francisco and I&#39;ve never been to Alcatraz.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Ah, it&#39;s fantastic. It was one of the best places I visited in America. It was Alcatraz prison. And you can take the audio tour and listen about all the
  <span class="audionotes">
   ex-convicts
  </span>
  . What they did and what daily life was like in Alcatraz. Really, good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, well, I&#39;m going home in a few days and I&#39;m gonna go to Alcatraz.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  You should do. You should do it. And another prison that I visited that&#39;s very famous was Robben Island just off the coast of Cape Town in South Africa, and that&#39;s where Nelson Mandela spent most of his days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No kidding. Robben Island.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Robben Island. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do they still have his room made up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  They do. They have his room all still made up, and you can read lots of
  <span class="audionotes">
   leaflets
  </span>
  about Nelson Mandela and hen they take you, show you the work yard, and basically he was spending, I think was twelve hours per day working outside in the South African heat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s insane.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  You can see all around the prison yard. That&#39;s really interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you&#39;ve seen the prisons in South Africa and in America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Also I went to
  <span class="audionotes">
   a crazy prison
  </span>
  in Kuala Lumpur in the center on Malaysia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah. As you arrive at the airport, if you take the monorail from the station into central Kuala Lumpur, then you see the old prison. It&#39;s now closed, but outside the prison, on the walls, it&#39;s got lots of graffiti and basically the government has written the graffiti and it basically tells you do not smuggle drugs into Malaysia or you will be staying here for a long time, and the prison looks like the worst building you&#39;ve ever seen in your life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and also it warns you about the death penalty, if you smuggle drugs into Malaysia, you&#39;ll receive the death penalty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man, that&#39;s... well, that&#39;s tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I think I got this fascination for prisons because near my house in England there used to be a big prison that looked like an old castle, old scary castle and I used to pass that sometimes when I was going to work when I was younger, so that&#39;s why I have this strange interest in prisons.
