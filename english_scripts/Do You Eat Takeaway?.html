   Daniel
  </strong>
  : So do you ever buy take-away?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : No, I never. Normally when I go out to eat, I like to sit and enjoy my food. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well, that&#39;s really nice. Of course, I do like to sit and enjoy my food, but I have to admit that occasionally I have to buy take-away, especially when I&#39;m coming late from work, and I&#39;m driving. I&#39;m so hungry that, most of the time, I don&#39;t really make it home, so I have to buy something on my way, and that&#39;s a shame, so that&#39;s the way it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  And do you usually have people over for dinner?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yes, I sometimes do. I really like cooking so occasionally I invite my friends over and cook for them or we all cook together. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Not really. I do love cooking, but the problem is my place is really small, so even though I want to invite my friends. I never do it, because my place would only fit one or two people. So unfortunately, I never have my friends over for dinner.
