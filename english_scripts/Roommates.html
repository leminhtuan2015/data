  Todd:
 </strong>
 So JJ, I hear you&#39;ve got a good
 <span class="audionotes">
  living arrangement
 </span>
 ?
 <p>
  <strong>
   JJ:
  </strong>
  I love it. Of course you know like any person, I was a little bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   leery
  </span>
  about living with roommates but at the same time I thought living in a foreign country I didn&#39;t want to isolate myself completely especially since I don&#39;t speak the language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  I first met Jessica at the airport and when we were
  <span class="audionotes">
   close to tears
  </span>
  from laughing so hard on the train ride from the airport to
  <em>
   Matsudo
  </em>
  Station and realized this is going to be a good living arrangement.
 </p>
 <p>
  We got here and the Brits had taken one half of the apartment and so we Americans moved into the other half and have gotten along brilliantly. Even the little
  <span class="audionotes">
   squabbles
  </span>
  that
  <span class="audionotes">
   tend to come up
  </span>
  seem to be solved fairly quickly, maturely and I love it. This is the best living arrangement I&#39;ve ever had. At the same time, I think it&#39;s kind of something  that can be expected when you come to teach abroad. It takes a certain kind of person to decide to
  <span class="audionotes">
   leave everything familiar behind
  </span>
  and meet new people, have new experiences. You&#39;re not taping any of this are you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, I am actually. Thanks a lot, JJ.
