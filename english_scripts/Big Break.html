   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now Matt, you used to work in Hollywood as an actor. Can you talk about what kind of actor you were?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Sure. I acted mainly in
  <span class="audionotes">
   commercial work
  </span>
  and that is I
  <span class="audionotes">
   auditioned
  </span>
  for commercials and basically in Los Angeles it&#39;s unlike any other city in the world for acting and it&#39;s just so heavily centered around Hollywood and television and screen work that there isn&#39;t really a lot of work in theater so I didn&#39;t have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   ton of training
  </span>
  going in to the acting world when I entered L.A. so like many others I opted just for commercial work and tried to get experience that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool. So how do you actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   get a gig
  </span>
  ? Tell me about the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  It actually... It&#39;s a lot more complicated than I thought when I first got there and competitive. Basically, there are two types of actors in Los Angeles. There&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   union actors and non-union
  </span>
  . And to really progress you need to be a union actor which takes getting a speaking part or doing commercial work, which took me about six months and from there becoming a SAG member, screen actor&#39;s guild member. You&#39;re in the union which looks a lot better on your resume to go after agents so that was my next step and after I got an agent then I was able to be sent out on auditions and look for work that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how did you get your first big break?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  It was just by chance really. I was acting and I was doing a lot of non-speaking work on television and movies and really not progressing as fast as I wanted to and I was on a commercial for I think it was Pepsi and they liked my look and they needed an extra guy in the scene in a library and they put me in and from that thirty second spot which was shown all the East Coast of the United States I has half of my income for my first year because you get royalty checks every time a commercial is shown on television. You get paid, so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Yeah... But from there I went back to television and movies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool.
