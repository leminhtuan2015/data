 Hey, Mari. So, we&#39;re comparing places this week and you&#39;ve lived in two great cities: Tokyo and New York and you speak both English and Japanese so you must know them very well, so can you tell me about the people in the places?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  In New York City, the people are friendly. If you&#39;re lost in the subway or you&#39;re not sure which bus to take, if you ask someone, even though they look pretty busy or
  <span class="audionotes">
   absorbed
  </span>
  they&#39;ll be willing to tell you which way you are supposed to go, and they&#39;ll be very
  <span class="audionotes">
   blunt
  </span>
  and tell you if they don&#39;t know which one you&#39;re supposed to take. When you go into the stores, the people in the stores are... they like to
  <span class="audionotes">
   make small talk
  </span>
  with you. They&#39;re interested in you as a person in terms of where you&#39;re from or you know, what you are looking for that day and why you are looking for that item.

  I think in Tokyo, if you are in the subway station, or the train station, the JR people or the subway people are very helpful in terms of which subway you&#39;re supposed to go on, or to help you get to that destination, but when you go into the stores, the clerks are very helpful in terms of finding whatever you&#39;re looking for, but I think because of the culture, they&#39;re not... they don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   delve into your personal life
  </span>
  as much as the shop attendants in New York.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  So in terms of food, how does it differ between New York and Tokyo?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I think New York and Tokyo both have very international foods. In both cities, you can find foods from all over the world. I think that because New York City is a
  <span class="audionotes">
   city of immigrants
  </span>
  , you get very... the people who cook the foods are from that country, while in Japan I feel like if you go to a Mexican restaurant and you see like a Japanese person cooking the Mexican food, so I think that the cuisine, the international cuisine in New York City is more real versus the one in Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  So, if you had to eat one thing in New York and one thing in Tokyo, what would it be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Oh, my gosh, that&#39;s a very difficult question. In New York City I would eat pizza. I think that they have the best pizza in the world. If you like greasy, cheesy pizza. In Japan, I really like the Italian food in Japan. I know that it&#39;s not very authentic Italian food but I think they do a really good job with Italian food here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s interesting. So, in terms of shopping, where would you like to shop more?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I feel like I&#39;m going to be biased towards New York City but I think that the shopping in New York City is a lot better. The primary reason being that it&#39;s just cheaper.
