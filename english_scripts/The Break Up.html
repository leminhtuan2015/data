  Crystal:
 </strong>
 Hey, George, actually
 <span class="audionotes">
  it&#39;s funny that you mentioned relationships
 </span>
 cause I&#39;m actually having a problem with Joe.
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Is that the guy with the curly hair?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that guy. He&#39;s really nice and everything, but like
  <span class="audionotes">
   I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s working out
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Why what&#39;s wrong?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Well, he&#39;s really narrow-minded and I&#39;m really different. We just ... he&#39;s nice and everything. He&#39;s kind and sweet, and it&#39;s just not for me, like we&#39;re totally different people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I see. So what are you going to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  I think I have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   rip the band-aid
  </span>
  and I think I&#39;m just gonna send him an e-mail or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  E-mail! But you&#39;ve been dating for awhile now and you like him right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we&#39;re like so sweet together, but it&#39;s just ... I don&#39;t see a future.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  But isn&#39;t an e-mail just a little too cold and he might tell other people about it, and rumors spreading and what not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  OK, then, what do you think I should do? How should I do it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  You should probably just meet him face-to-face?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Ugh! Face-to-face. OK. Where should I meet him? Like do you think I should just invite him over to my place?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  You should probably do it in public, where, you know...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Ooh, good, good, good, good. That&#39;s better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Maybe that cafe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Ah, that cafe. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  While I&#39;m having my date, you can be breaking up with your boyfriend. It&#39;ll be great!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re so mean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sorry.
  <span class="audionotes">
   That was uncalled for
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know what to say. What do you think would hurt him less?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I gotta say
  <span class="audionotes">
   honesty would be the best policy
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Honesty. OK, so this is what I&#39;m going to say. Joe, you&#39;re great, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   we&#39;re not meant to be
  </span>
  . How&#39;s that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s great. It&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  OK, so, OK, OK, I&#39;m done. I think I&#39;ll meet him at the cafe, and OK, things will work from then. I&#39;ll improvise.
 </p>
