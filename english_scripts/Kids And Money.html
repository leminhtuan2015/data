 <strong>
  Hanna:
 </strong>
 So, next week I have to do a debate in my finance class.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Oh, really, what is your debate about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  Our debate topic is about whether we should teach finance to kids, so things like investment and the stock market. Things like tax.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  OK, and what do you think about the topic?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  I think it is really important that kids learn about things like this, particularly in our society these days, where literally everything
  <span class="audionotes">
   revolves around money
  </span>
  . I mean, even when you&#39;re fourteen or fifteen, you go out and get a job and you have to start doing things like paying tax, and I mean, you&#39;re gonna have savings, and you can invest that if you wanted to and turn that into more money, so even when you&#39;re really young I think it is important to know this kind of information.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  But don&#39;t you think that there&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a lot of consequences
  </span>
  when you&#39;re burdening kids from ... what was it - middle school, high school with financial responsibilities? I mean
  <span class="audionotes">
   kids are kids after all
  </span>
  . Shouldn&#39;t they be playing around ... going to the park instead of worrying about the stock market crashing in Europe or in the states?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  Well, they don&#39;t have to worry about the stock market crashing, but I think it is good if just they know a little bit of information about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  But if they have all the information every time there&#39;s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   drop in GE stocks
  </span>
  , they&#39;re going to
  <span class="audionotes">
   flip out
  </span>
  and you know, they won&#39;t be able to sleep and you&#39;re giving kids too much to worry about in an age they shouldn&#39;t be worrying about these things. It is after all they&#39;re parents&#39; responsibility to worry about these things, and eventually it&#39;s going to be their turn but I think it&#39;s just giving them something before they have to worry about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  So you think junior high school&#39;s too early to start to start teaching kids about this kind of stuff?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I think so. Yeah. Especially when you&#39;re making it because they have to take responsibility of their own money considering the fact that they don&#39;t even have an income.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  What if they do have an income?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Well, they&#39;re income would be like five dollars an hour, so I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be investing anything of that
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  Well, you never know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Maybe.
