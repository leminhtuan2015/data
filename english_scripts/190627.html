Ten U.S. Democratic presidential contenders are debating at this hour in the first major event of the 2020 election campaign.  The immediate focus at the debate [on] in Miami, that is, was on Senator Elizabeth Warren, a progressive lawmaker from Massachusetts.
<br><br>
Warren said in discussing health care that she wants the government to pay for health care both for those who have it and for those who do not have insurance.
<br><br>
"There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible, we just can't do it, have a lot of political reasons for this.  What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it.  Well, health care is a basic human right."
<br><br>
New Jersey Senator Cory Booker said that good health care is essential to having a good life.
<br><br>
"Health care, it's not just a human right, it should be an American right.  And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare-for-all.  But I have an urgency about this.  When I'm president of the United States, I'm not going to wait.  We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care."
<br><br>
Another ten Democratic contenders will debate on Thursday night, including former Vice President Joe Biden and other top-tier possible choices including Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of the Midwestern city of South Bend, Indiana and six others.

The U.S. Senate on Wednesday approved a bill that would grant $4.6 billion for border aid in a bid to stem illegal migration across the country's southern border with Mexico.
<br><br>
As AP's Tim McGuire reports, the bill still has to be reconciled with a similar bill that passed in the House.
<br><br>
The Senate overwhelmingly passed a $4.6 billion measure to cover the cost to shelter and feed migrants detained by the Border Patrol and care for unaccompanied migrant children who are turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services.  Both agencies are struggling to care for the tens of thousands of people.
<br><br>
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants some changes.  "I think there are four changes to this bill.  We could quickly have a conference, talk about those four changes, try to get them in the bill and finish this ...."
<br><br>
Before leaving for the G-20 summit in Japan, President Trump also said the funding is urgent.  Both houses need to approve any changes ahead of next week's 4th of July recess.

U.S. President Donald Trump blasted former special counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday after Mueller agreed to provide open testimony before congressional committees next month.
<br><br>
As AP's Mike Gracia reports, some Democrats on Capitol Hill are concerned Trump will try to stop Mueller from testifying.
<br><br>
With special counsel Robert Mueller scheduled to appear before two House committees next month, some Democrats worry the White House or Justice Department will try to block Mueller's testimony.
<br><br>
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says there is every indication that President Trump will continue interfering in any way he can.  But House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler is sounding confident.
<br><br>
"I suspect that whatever the White House says, then I can make us, Mueller will not make us try to enforce the subpoena in court."
<br><br>
Rare back-to-back testimony from Mueller before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees is scheduled for July 17.

U.S. President Donald Trump plans to hold nine bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, including with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
<br><br>
Charles De Ledesma of AP reports Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants a consensus on trade and other difficult issues.
<br><br>
Speaking at the end of Japan's current parliamentary session, Abe stressed importance of global leaders overcoming their differences and joining hands in tackling difficult issues to send a strong message to the rest of the world.
<br><br>
He said he hopes to lead the summit by patiently finding common ground in order to achieve concrete results rather than stressing or focusing on differences of opinion.  Abe also expressed hope that the U.S. and China will resolve a trade dispute when their leaders meet during and on the sidelines of the summit on Friday and Saturday.
