   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Phil, you mentioned that you actually studied automotive engineering.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s correct.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, can you explain what automotive engineering is?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s basically car design and basically technology involved in cars in all aspects: the engine, the performance,
  <span class="audionotes">
   the aerodynamics
  </span>
  , so it&#39;s basically an overview of all kind of car aspects for the future.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool, so you must know a lot about the cars of the future and stuff. I mean, how do you see cars in let&#39;s say twenty years, thirty years, forty years?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  In the near future I think the big developments will be
  <span class="audionotes">
   alternative fuels
  </span>
  . At the moment petrol and diesel engines are causing a lot of damage to the planet and we&#39;re going to eventually run out of natural resources, so I think the developments will be towards electric or
  <span class="audionotes">
   hybrid cars
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Maybe even using fuel cells such as hydrogen.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, like how many years away do you think this is?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Realistically, ten to fifteen years away before we start seeing the first ones in production but before we see everyone using them, it&#39;s going to be twenty years, I would have thought, I guess.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.... Now, I once had a student who was an engineer for Chyrsler, Daimal-Chrystler, and he was saying that they already have cars that can drive without people, like you can just say your location and it&#39;ll go there. Have you heard about that?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve seen the technology from a German company called Volkswagon as well. The problem with this technology - it&#39;s brilliant. It&#39;s amazing what it can do, but people&#39;s attitude is the problem. People like the
  <span class="audionotes">
   sense of freedom
  </span>
  from having a car.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  And if your car is driving you then you lose that. It&#39;s like being on a train of something, so you lose that individual sense of freedom.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s right. That&#39;s a good point.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil
  </strong>
  : And then, there&#39;s the infrastructure.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, so you think that basically, it&#39;ll never take off, that people will always want to drive their own cars?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Possibly, although maybe they could develop a system where in the inner cities the system is used, basically to help, because traffic
  <span class="audionotes">
   flow and congestion
  </span>
  is a problem.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  So maybe within the cities, the system could be used, but outside the city, people would always want their freedom in the country roads - the thrill of driving, the excitement.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right... Now when you watch movies, you often see cars that can fly, or cars that can go underwater like in a James Bond movie. Do you see that maybe in the future?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Underwater I think would be a bit pointless, and very difficult to achieve the engineering. It&#39;s possible now, but the engineering is just ridiculously hi-tech, but I don&#39;t know about the flying cars. Maybe in hundreds of years but certainly not in my lifetime and not in anyone&#39;s lifetime who&#39;s listening to this website, no.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  All right. Thanks a lot Phil.
