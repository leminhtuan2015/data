 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 So CleAnn can you talk a little bit about your country?
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  Sure. My country is called officially the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.
  <span class="audionotes">
   For short
  </span>
  , Trinidad and Tobago. And even shorter, Trinidad. However, it is best to just say Trinidad and Tobago cause sometimes people from Tobago may get offended if you just say Trinidad. People from my country are usually just called Trinidadians, but if you are, again, trying to be
  <span class="audionotes">
   inclusive
  </span>
  of people from Tobago, we say Trinbagonians.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Trini-bagonians?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  Trinbagonians.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It’s hard to pronounce.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  Yeah, exactly. So sometimes we just say Trinidadians. But actually, although Tobago is extremely small. I mean, Trinidad is also small but Tobago is I think probably about 1/6 the size of Trinidad and it’s actually extremely important to the country as a whole because Tobago is our center for tourism. Trinidad doesn’t have much tourism. We are more industry and oil and gas based, but Tobago is very beautiful and is known for tourism, for its natural
  <span class="audionotes">
   scenery
  </span>
  , and it’s actually an
  <span class="audionotes">
   ecotourism
  </span>
  destination.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Tobago has, I take it, rain-forests and beaches and...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  Yes, small rain-forests, beaches and there is a very famous place called the Nylon Pool. And it’s famous because it’s actually out in the middle of the sea but you can stand out there because the corals have risen to such a height that it’s close to the water. So boats take you out and then you can get off the boat and just stand out in the middle of the ocean on top of corals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, how nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  It’s very nice and it’s white, just white coral. So it’s really gorgeous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that must be beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  Yes. It’s called the Nylon Pool because I think one of the British Monarchies, someone from the British Royal Family, visited Trinidad some years...many years ago and said that the Nylon Pool actually looks like nylon. The water reminded her of nylon so it was named the Nylon Pool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So if people go to Tobago on vacation, which island do they fly into?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  They fly to Tobago if you’re going...if you’re coming from England, direct flights are from Tobago. There are no flights from Trinidad to England. Only we have to go to Tobago and then from Tobago to London. From the US, I think you have to come through Trinidad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually how far apart are the islands from each other?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  By plane, 15 minutes...or less.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So there’s like
  <span class="audionotes">
   ferries
  </span>
  that...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the ferry -- the fastest one right now is about 3 hours, but it’s not a very fast ferry at all. So there’s ferry, we have air transport of course to Tobago also. There&#39;s talk now of building a bridge but I don’t know how soon that will be done.
