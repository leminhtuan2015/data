  Fred:
 </strong>
 Hi, Shibika, so this is almost the end of the year, 2007. Can you tell me a bit, how was your year this year?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I had pretty nice year actually.
  <span class="style6">
   I went through a lot
  </span>
  of
  <span class="audionotes">
   ups and downs
  </span>
  , and yeah, at first I did really well in my classes and I got a scholarship so that was something that was really nice. It made my parents really proud of me, but then later I went back home for vacation and then unfortunately, I met through an accident, a car accident, and yeah, I had to be in bed for a month or something, so that was... initially I was like, a bit of thrown off but then that itself was
  <span class="audionotes">
   a very good learning experience
  </span>
  because it made me really strong and, yeah...
 </p>

  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  OK, so you&#39;re saying that even though you had a bad experience, it made you a stronger person.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. Yeah. It made me a really strong person and then it was like, I was not anymore more scared of accidents and I was not scared of any
  <span class="audionotes">
   unfortunate mishappenings
  </span>
  because they&#39;re a part of your life, you know, you can&#39;t really help them happening, they don&#39;t happen for reason, so you just got to
  <span class="audionotes">
   accept them and move on
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s right but I&#39;m guessing that you&#39;re gonna be so much more of a stronger person the following year and so you can accomplish...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Many more things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Yeah. At that time I felt as if like I had wasted a lot of time and I was not able to go for my classes or I could not... I was not able to enjoy my vacations but it was,
  <span class="audionotes">
   it didn&#39;t turn out to be that bad
  </span>
  because I sat at home, watched TV and I was being served and taken care of all the time so that was a good thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s nice. You can say that that&#39;s the best thing that happened to you this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Yeah. The
  <span class="style6">
   best thing in disguise
  </span>
  , you know, because initially I didn&#39;t see it as a good thing obviously but, yeah, it made me feel how much people who are close to me, how much they care for me and how much they love me, so it was a really good thing.
