   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Laura, I&#39;m going to ask you questions about the post office in Hong Kong. OK, or just sending letters. How often do you write letters?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Laura:
  </strong>
  Well, when I was young, I wrote quite often to my
  <span class="audiodef">
   pen pals
  </span>
  , but right now, instead of sending a letter I usually send my friends e-mails.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah! Me, too. How much does it cost to send a postcard in Hong Kong
  <span class="audiodef">
   overseas
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Laura:
  </strong>
  Well, to Asian countries, it costs about two dollars, two Hong Kong dollars. To European countries it costs about three dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and when you send mail in Hong Kong, do you send it from your house, or do you..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Laura:
  </strong>
  Well, we have to go the post office in order to send letters or
  <span class="audiodef">
   parcels
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really, OK! Cause it&#39;s so crowded in Hong Kong that...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Laura:
  </strong>
  Well, Yes, Yes!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and in Japan do you receive a lot of mail?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Laura:
  </strong>
  Right now, no. Well, because it&#39;s so
  <span class="audiodef">
   convenient
  </span>
  to use the e-mails or
  <span class="audiodef">
   instant
  </span>
  communication or telephone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, OK last question. What time do post offices open and close?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Laura:
  </strong>
  Well, it depends on the size of the post office. For large one, so, they work longer. Like from nine in the morning until six, so for a smaller one, from nine to five.
