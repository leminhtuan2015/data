   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, how was your trip to Thailand?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  Oh, I spent about six weeks in Thailand and had a really, really great time. I spent three weeks in Northern Thailand and then three weeks on the beach in the southern part of Thailand but my last night I was packing up and I had a suitcase in the corner with the warm clothes from Northern Thailand and I saw something dark in the corner, and I&#39;m thinking,&#34; Oh, it&#39;s just some clothes that fell out of my suitcase so I reach out to grab the clothes and something dark rose up and spread out and it was the weirdest feeling because at the same time I felt like a hand grab me from behind and yanked me out of the cabin and I didn&#39;t feel any fear until I was in the middle of the clearing and I screamed twice, and got everybody&#39;s attention, &#34;What? What? What?&#34; and I said &#34;snake&#34; and of course a few people started laughing, thinking,
  <br>
  &#34;Oh, well, this little bitty green, harmless snake&#34; Ah, no big deal. So one of the little bitty Thai girls, walks into my cabin and she comes running out, &#34;Ah, snake!&#34; and so it was a black king cobra, which is the most poisonous snake in the world, and this is really kind of scary because my little brother had been killed by a snake and so it&#39;s frightening to me to think how close I came. After I left Thailand, two things happened: I found some photographs in which in the photographs that I took of my cabin you could see the snake crawling into my cabin and the other one is an e-mail from the owners of the resort that they found two more cobras underneath my bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, oh man! So normally do they have king cobras on that part of the island?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  No, they don&#39;t. They say they may come in when they transport, the building, they&#39;re making a lot of new buildings so they brought in wood from Northern Thailand and maybe it came in there. Also the envirorment&#39;s being upset and they&#39;re chopping down a lot of trees, and they&#39;re finding more and more snakes that they didn&#39;t know were there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, well, you&#39;re very lucky.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;ve been told that!
 </p>
