 Hi, Fred.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Hi, Sabriya.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  So, we&#39;re going to be celebrating New Year&#39;s soon. Tell me how was your year?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Wow. My year. 2007. It was a great year for me
  <span class="audionotes">
   I have to say
  </span>
  . I feel like I&#39;ve grown so much as a person. I&#39;ve done so many things this year that made me become I feel a much more responsible person, a more mature man. I&#39;ve been working quite a bit at the school, but I&#39;ve also been doing a few things outside of school, such as working with children as well. I&#39;ve been working in a camp where we teach kids for twelve days English. Well, actually we don&#39;t really teach them. What we do is we
  <span class="audionotes">
   spend twelve days with them
  </span>
  and during those twelve days, the children that don&#39;t speak English come to this camp and have to only speak English for twelve days and we do all kinds of different activities with them.

  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  So how do you teach the children without communicating with them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   That&#39;s the beauty of it
  </span>
  . I understand that English is really important, but however we have this saying during the camp that
  <span class="audionotes">
   our hearts speak as one
  </span>
  and so we understand each other without using so many words, but of course the children have some basis in English and so we can understand each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  OK, that&#39;s very beautiful.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Going back to the topic
  </span>
  we were discussing right now, tell me what was the best thing that happened to you this year?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  The best thing that happened to me this year? I have to say that the best thing that happened to me this year was when I went back to Canada, I had the opportunity of spending lots of time with my grandmother, and you see, when I was growing up as a child she practically raised me, and so I have a special relationship with her. I do love everybody from my family, but my relationship with my grandmother is really great and spending two months with her was great for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Well, I can relate to that too since my grandmother raised me as well, so I hope you have another great year next year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Thank you very much.
