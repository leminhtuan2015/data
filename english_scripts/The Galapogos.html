 Hello Felipe, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Hello, I&#39;m fine thank you and you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Good. Listen I was reading about the Galapagos and I think that you might know a lot more than what I can find in the books. Can you tell me a little bit more about Galapagos, what is it or where is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well yes. Since I was living in Ecuador I know about the Galapagos because the Galapagos is part of Ecuador. Galapagos is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean and it&#39;s really famous because of its
  <span class="audionotes">
   diversity
  </span>
  of animals and plants, so it attracts many, many hundreds, maybe thousands, of tourists every day from many countries in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  That is so interesting, but what is so special about the nature? I mean all islands have nature so about the Galapagos why is it so special?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  OK. I&#39;ll
  <span class="audionotes">
   give you a clue
  </span>
  . Do you know about the giant turtles of the Galapagos?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Oh, I know about the giant turtles, but not that they&#39;re from the Galapagos. Can you tell me about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well in fact there is, there are the giant turtles in the Galapagos and actually are considered to be the biggest turtles in the world so they are called giant turtles of the Galapagos and now this is something really special because you know who is Darwin?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Darwin, yes of course but
  <span class="audionotes">
   what does it have to do with
  </span>
  the Galapagos?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well actually the British explorer, Darwin, traveled to the Galapagos in the nineteenth century and by looking at the many difference that you can find between the many different animals of each of the islands, he
  <span class="audionotes">
   came up with
  </span>
  the
  <span class="audionotes">
   Theory of Evolution
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  So it was in the Galapagos?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Yes, it was there that Darwin came up with the...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Wow, I didn&#39;t know that. Now I want to continue reading much more about the Galapagos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Thank you Felipe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
