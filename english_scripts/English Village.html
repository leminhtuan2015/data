 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:

  <span class="audionotes">
   Pretty good
  </span>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Could you please
  <span class="audionotes">
   introduce yourself
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah. My name is Steven and I come from the north of England.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really? Where in the north of England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  A little village called Gawsworth.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is it a big place?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  No, it&#39;s about 10 thousand people I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really? Do you go back there often?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Not so often. The last time I went back was Christmas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really? OK. Did you have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   good time
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was very nice. I saw old friends and family and
  <span class="audionotes">
   did the usual Christmas things
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What actually are the usual Christmas things?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Oh, I guess a lot of eating and a lot of drinking and a lot of laughing. Just general fun and games I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Great
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
  How many of your family members still live in this town?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, they don&#39;t actually....my mom and dad live in the town. My brother and sister actually live
  <span class="audionotes">
   pretty close
  </span>
  to this town, so my family is all in that general area.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Great. Thanks a lot Steven.

  My name&#39;s Ruth and I&#39;m from a small village in England. I live quite near Nottingham and I&#39;ve lived there for most of my life actually. Nottingham is quite famous for Sherwood forest, where Robin hood was supposed to live and as a child I spent some of my time in Sherwood Forest playing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I live in a village and it&#39;s actually a mining village with about 1,000 or 1,500 inhabitants. There&#39;s really not very much to do there. There&#39;s a shop and a post office, a school and my mom teaches at the school.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did actually live in Edinburgh for one year and that was quite different from life in my village because there was so much more to do and there were so many more people and there was so much more traffic, but I think actually I prefer living in a village because, well, if you want to go out to the shops, if you want to go to the cinema, you can go to the nearest town, or to the nearest city, but you can always escape city life and you can always go back to where it&#39;s quiet and more peaceful and where everybody knows each other, but if you live in the city you can&#39;t really escape it, and I don&#39;t really like the noise of the city so I think I will probably live in a village for the rest of my life.
