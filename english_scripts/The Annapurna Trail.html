   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Jonathan, every time I see you, you are
  <span class="audionotes">
   coming and going
  </span>
  on a new trip, a new adventure. What&#39;s your next trip?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m about to fly to Nepal to go trekking. I head out to stay at the airport tonight and I&#39;m flying tomorrow morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what are you going to do in Nepal? Are you going to go to Katmandu?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ll be flying into Katmandu and then traveling to a smaller town to begin a trek around the Annapurna Himalayas
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The Annapurna? You&#39;re gonna climb the Himalaya&#39;s?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s not climbing in the sense of needing mountaineering experience or special equipment. It&#39;s like a very vigorous hike, but it does
  <span class="audionotes">
   take an average of
  </span>
  22 or 23 days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re going to go camping for 23 days?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  No, you don&#39;t need to camp. There are small teahouses, and simple backpacker-type accommodation all
  <span class="audionotes">
   along the way
  </span>
  . So you can stay there. You don&#39;t need to bring a lot of equipment with you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s great. You just walk from teahouse to teahouse?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Yes. There&#39;s always people along the paths, so you don&#39;t really need a guide
  <span class="audionotes">
   or anything
  </span>
  . You can&#39;t really get lost. You&#39;re always meeting other people. And if you decide you get tired a little bit earlier, there are lots of places along the way that you can stay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What exactly is a teahouse like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  A teahouse is a very simple accommodation. Maybe the room&#39;s have wooden walls that are very thin. Maybe the beds are not very comfortable, but people stop and drink tea along the way. It&#39;s just very simple accommodation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, if you want to sleep, it&#39;s just just like a little bunk bed?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Usually, you can have a private room which would be vey small. Perhaps the size of your closet or a little larger with a bed and it may only cost about a dollar a night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Yes, it&#39;s very cheap to trek in a country like Nepal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, like how much does it cost to go trekking for 23 days?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  I think it will probably cost me a total of about 300 dollars US
  <span class="audionotes">
   equivalent
  </span>
  . The most expensive thing is the flight to get there in the first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That sound fantastic.
 </p>
