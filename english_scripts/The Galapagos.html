   Todd:
  </b>
  OK, Jose, you just said you went to the Galapagos Islands.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Can you talk about the Galapagos?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes, the Galapagos, as everybody knows is such a unique place and I went there and by chance I was in the same tour like with President Carter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Wow! He&#39;s my favorite president.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Well, it&#39;s so interesting because you know the guy was, I mean when went there, all of a sudden I had this strange people looking at me. I say, &#34;What happened? What&#39;s wrong?&#34; There were 8 bodyguards with the guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  No kidding!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes! He was with his wife and his daughter and the child
  <b>
   .
  </b>
  Yeah it was interesting. You know that&#39;s just one anecdote but still, I&#39;m , the Galapagos Islands, what I can tell you is that, it&#39;s a unique place, but you have to go there, sooner than later is better because I think the whole ecosystem will collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Oh, no!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yeah! The situation is very complicated because lack of ---- of the government. The poor fisherman, and they don&#39;t have any kind of way to actually make a living by destroying the system. And all the money just goes to the big tourist companies that are taking tourists and you go to the capital, to Quito, but the people on the Islands, they don&#39;t have money, so they are, there&#39;s no control, for fishing, I mean, sharks and lobsters and tuna and so on, so everything is terrible. I was very very upset with the situation, and also you know, it&#39;s a kind of tourism for rich people and I was the only Ecuadorian in the group
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Really! That&#39;s not good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes, that&#39;s not good. You know we were just servers and waitresses and waiters and Ecuadorians so, for me it was, I was 5 days there. You know it&#39;s very beautiful to see the animals and birds but me being an Ecuadorian I had a completely different point of view. I was very disappointed frankly.
