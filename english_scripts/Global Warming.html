  Todd:
 </strong>
 Christine you&#39;re from Papua New Guinea?
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Christine
 </strong>
 : Yes, we&#39;re a small island in the South Pacific.
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 And that is near Australia?
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Christine
 </strong>
 : Just above Australia.
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 Like how far is it from Australia?
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Christine
 </strong>
 : To Brisbane it&#39;s 3 hours by plane.
 <strong>
 </strong>
 To the tip of Australia it&#39;s about an hour and a half by boat.
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 We were talking earlier about global warming and how this can be a problem for your island.
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Christine
 </strong>
 : Oh, absolutely, because we&#39;re surrounded by water, obviously it creates a problem when the tides rise.
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 Because the tides rise, and the water...
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Christine
 </strong>
 : The tides rise, and a lot of people build their homes and villages around the water....cause the ocean is where we get our food from, most of our costal villages are based there, so, yeah!
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 The people put their houses close to the water.
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Christine
 </strong>
 : Close to the water or on the water
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 So what do you think about global warming? I mean, what do you think should be done?
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  Christine
 </strong>
 : Like we were talking about it earlier, I am very much for the Kyoto Protocol I think that industrial countries, industrialized countries need to act now before there&#39;s too much, how do you say?, before even more damage is done. Obviously being from a small country where people aren&#39;t educated about these things we don&#39;t realize what is really happening, but we are really starting to realize now and we and other small nations have spoken out about it and it&#39;s good to know that bigger countries are doing something about it, and I think thing needs to be done now, rather than waiting, which is happening with governments which are under economical stress right now...they haven&#39;t done enough..they know the situation, they know they&#39;re responsible for it. We&#39;re the ones who are suffering because of it even though we don&#39;t add to it. Yeah, so I think they should do something.
