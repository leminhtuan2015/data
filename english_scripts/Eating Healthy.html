   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hey, Todd. Are you healthy? Do you eat lots of fruits and vegetables?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I guess I am healthy. I do eat lots of fruits and vegetables, but I also eat junk food,
  <span class="audionotes">
   sadly
  </span>
  . But I try to eat lots of fruits especially to stay healthy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : What kind of fruits do you like to eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, I like all fruits. I love all fruits except pineapple. I hate pineapple. I don&#39;t know why. I just don&#39;t like pineapple. I don&#39;t like the taste. I don&#39;t like to
  <span class="audionotes">
   chew
  </span>
  it. It just
  <span class="audionotes">
   feels funny
  </span>
  . But I love apples, I love bananas, I love oranges. I usually have an apple every morning for breakfast. It&#39;s very easy to eat. And I just love apples because you can take them to school. You can eat them quickly. They&#39;re very easy to eat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also like oranges, and I love orange juice. So sometimes, I make fresh orange juice in my kitchen. So oranges are great. But my favorite fruits are bananas and strawberries. I love bananas and strawberries. And I love to eat bananas and strawberries together, so my favorite snack is to cut up some banana and then cut up some strawberry and mix them together, and then eat them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Well, it sounds like you really a lot of fruits.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah, I do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : What about vegetables? Do you eat vegetables everyday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I do. I try to have a salad everyday, and I have a special salad I make and I call it my chunky, crunchy salad. And it&#39;s carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes, and I cut the carrots and cucumbers into small little squares. And then I cut up the tomatoes and I mix together. And the carrots, tomatoes and cucumbers mixed together, the colors are really pretty. And when you eat the salad, it&#39;s very crunchy and it&#39;s very
  <span class="audionotes">
   chunky
  </span>
  because it&#39;s all little squares. So I call it my
  <span class="audionotes">
   crunchy
  </span>
  , chunky salad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : That sounds delicious. Do you ever share it with someone else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No, I don&#39;t but I want to because I really, I like it so much and I can&#39;t cook. So when I go to somebody&#39;s house and I need to bring food, I think, &#34;Oh, I should bring chunky, crunchy salad.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hmm, that&#39;s a good idea. Another idea is to cook some vegetables. Do you cook vegetables?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Not too much. I do cook
  <span class="audionotes">
   asparagus
  </span>
  . Asparagus is probably my favorite vegetable, and it&#39;s very easy to cook because asparagus, you just have to cut up into small pieces. And then you can put the asparagus in a bowl with some water in the microwave, and you can cook asparagus in about 30 seconds. So I eat asparagus a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, I eat broccoli. I love broccoli. Sometimes I have broccoli and lettuce together for my salad. And then sometimes, I cook eggplant. I like to cook eggplant because I like the taste and it&#39;s easy to cook.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t really like eggplant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh no. Why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It has a strange flavor to me, so I
  <span class="audionotes">
   prefer not to
  </span>
  eat eggplant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   as long as
  </span>
  you eat your
  <span class="audionotes">
   veggies
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes.
