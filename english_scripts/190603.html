The gunman who killed 12 people at a Virginia Beach government building on Friday had emailed his employers a resignation letter hours earlier.
<br><br>
City Manager Dave Hansen said Sunday that the suspect, a longtime public utility employee, had notified his superiors Friday afternoon about his intention to quit his job.
<br><br>
Police Chief James Cervera said there is no information on the shooter's intended target if there was one.
<br><br>
"At this point of the investigation, we do not have any of the information that he was targeting anyone specifically."
<br><br>
Hansen said all but one of the murder victims were Virginia Beach City employees.  The other one was a contract worker.

China's defense minister on Sunday made a rare acknowledgement of the massacre of hundreds of protesters calling for democracy at Tiananmen Square in Beijing 30 years ago.
<br><br>
The defense minister answered a reporter's question about the events, saying the crackdown was the correct policy to quell the uprising.  He said China has undergone major changes in the past 30 years.  He also said China has enjoyed stability and development because of the way the government handled the uprising.
<br><br>
Tuesday, June 4th marks the 30th anniversary of the killings.  Chinese censors have scrubbed mention of the event from social media and suppressed any discussion about it.

Egypt has set a world record for (the) longest food table at a Ramadan breakfast, serving nearly 7,000 people on Saturday in the country's new administrative capital.
<br><br>
(The) pre-dawn meal was held at a table just over 3,000 meters long.  It beat the former record set in 2018 by 200 meters.  Last year's record was set in the United Arab Emirates.
<br><br>
An official from Guinness World Records was at the event to verify.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says he is not ready and he doesn't believe the country is ready for an effort to impeach President Trump for what he called "high crimes and misdemeanors."
<br><br>
Schiff said on ABC News' "This Week" that the move will likely fail due to a lack of support from Republicans in the House and Senate.
<br><br>
"... at this point, the speaker has not reached the conclusion - and I haven't either - that it's best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know is destined for failure in the Senate."
<br><br>
But he said Democrats could decide to move ahead with the effort if Trump continues to demonstrate, in his words, "his unfitness for office."
<br><br>
His comments followed an announcement by special counsel Robert Mueller last week, who said it was not an option for his team of prosecutors to charge the president with obstruction of justice or any other crime due to longstanding Justice Department policy.

Three explosions struck Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, on Sunday, including a sticky bomb attached to a bus carrying university students.  The blast caused more than 22 casualties.  The bus attack took place in the western part of the city.
<br><br>
Kabul police confirmed that two other blasts were later heard from the same area but couldn't provide more details.

A colony of little penguins on a remote island near Sydney, Australia, are moving into new, specially designed bunkers to ensure their survival after a bushfire wiped out their habitat last year.
<br><br>
From Sydney, Phil Mercer reports.
<br><br>
Little penguins are just that - about 35 centimeters tall and one kilogram in weight when fully grown.
<br><br>
In Sydney, Australia's biggest city, there are just two remaining colonies.  One in the seaside suburb of Manly is endangered because of hunting by foxes and development, while the other on Lion Island, an 8-hectare outpost in the city's north, is struggling following a bushfire that destroyed much of the island in 2018.
<br><br>
To help the population recover, wildlife rangers have installed 20 concrete burrows on Lion Island.  They are fireproof and protect the penguins from predators, such as foxes and goannas.
<br><br>
Originally, they were fairly common on the Australian mainland, but now their colonies are generally restricted to offshore islands.

And at least two bodies were retrieved on Sunday off Libya's Mediterranean coast after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants, including women and children, capsized.
<br><br>
The U.N. migration agency said as the search for survivors continues, the International Organization for Migration said the boat was carrying over 95 migrants and floundered off the coast of Garaboli, 60 kilometers east of Tripoli.
