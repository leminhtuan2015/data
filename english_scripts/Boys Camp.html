   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : So we&#39;re talking about camp today. Did you ever go to camp when you were a kid?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : I did. I usually went to Cub camp, you know like Boy Scouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : OK. Was it during the summer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Yes, it would always be in the summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : And was it for a week or a month?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : I can&#39;t recall, it probably was about a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : About a week. What did you do at Cub camp?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : We&#39;d do different things. One thing I remember is archery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Archery?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Yeah, like bows and arrows. So we would have a target and we would practice trying to hit the
  <span class="audionotes">
   target
  </span>
  and I was really bad at it. I remember always, it&#39;s quite difficult and I would hurt my arm with the bow. But then after we were trying to get the target I remember we did distance as well and I was actually pretty good at that. I figured out how to get a long shot away and I think, I might be lying, but I think I maybe got the longest shot than anyone else.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Wow. Congratulations. OK, besides archery were there other games you played or sports you did?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Yeah, we would learn how to canoe and we&#39;d swim and we&#39;d go on hikes. We learned how to
  <span class="audionotes">
   navigate
  </span>
  through the forest with a compass.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : OK. Did you learn how to start fire without matches?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : We did, yeah. We&#39;d use two sticks, rub them together and start a fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Wow. What would you guys do at night? Would you play games or have campfires?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Yes, we&#39;d always have a campfire at night. We&#39;d sing some songs, Kumbaya, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   put on
  </span>
  some skits and tell ghost stories but my favorite thing to do at the campfire was roast marshmallows.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : I&#39;d spend hours trying to find the perfect stick to carve and roast marshmallows on. Sometimes we&#39;d even make the chocolate smores for the marshmallows.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Yummy. So that food was good, how was the other food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t have any memories of it being good so I don&#39;t think it was very good. We would eat together in a mess hall much like yourself and actually I remember getting really sick one time and my parents had to come and pick me up and I think I got a bit of
  <span class="audionotes">
   food poisoning
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Oh wow, from the food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : In scout camp, wow. OK. Final question, so you were away from your family right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Was that hard or easy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : It was easy. I remember feeling a little freer and more independent away from my parents, less rules, less
  <span class="audionotes">
   regulations
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : You weren&#39;t homesick at all?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : No, I never did get homesick. Even when my parents came to pick me up that time when I was sick, I really didn&#39;t want to go home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s too bad you got food poisoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : OK, thanks Warren.
