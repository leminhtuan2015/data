   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Raphael, you were saying you lived in Paris.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rapheal:
  </strong>
  Yes, I made my studies there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Paris is just an amazing city. Can you talk about Paris?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rapheal:
  </strong>
  Yes! Well, the biggest difference I noticed with Tokyo is the size. Like Paris is nice in that way, you can go anywhere by walking. It might take at maximum an hour and a half if you want to go to a very far place, but basically it&#39;s a city like made for walkers and you can really go anywhere just by walking, I mean it&#39;s quite pleasant cause you can see many, you know, nice buildings and places and things, just by walking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s nice. How many people live in Paris?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rapheal:
  </strong>
  Including the suburbs it&#39;s 8 million now. Maybe getting increasing, but the inner city is only one million, so it&#39;s not overcrowded at all. Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what else would you say is different about Tokyo and Paris?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rapheal:
  </strong>
  Well, specially, Paris you mean? The Transport is less expensive. This is important.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rapheal:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s more expensive?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rapheal:
  </strong>
  No, it&#39;s less, sorry, it&#39;s less expensive. Anyway, the, I was surprised because Tokyo is not that expensive finally, I mean you can, you can live in a very expensive way if you want but you can save a lot as well. It&#39;s really up to you. But in Paris is quite hard to save. I mean, the food is very expensive, and if you want to go out, just, a restaurant or anything, it&#39;s really more expensive than in Japan. A restaurant for example, like prices in Japan start from a thousand yen, maybe less, like 600 yen, and in France like the cheapest restaurant you can find is 15 Euro which is around 2000 Yen
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Whoa! That is expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rapheal:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s more expensive, wherever you go it&#39;s more expensive if you want to go out but on the contrary the cinema is really cheap, so so many people go to the cinema, I mean, the cinema is really, it&#39;s a part of Paris nightlife, like, people used to go to cinema once a week at least, almost everyone. Yeah, cause it&#39;s really cheap. A ticket is 1000 yen, maybe less.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what about sports, like what kind of sports do you like to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rapheal:
  </strong>
  Yeah, anything. Anything, yeah! You have a lot of facilities, like gymnasium, swimming pools, clubs, yeah, you can practice a lot. Especially, I was a student so, I had this very easy student life because France has a lot of students, whatever it is, so they give you a bit of money, and you get discount on almost anything, so sport is specially favorized in Paris when you are a student, you canalmost like do whatever you want, as a sport almost free, sometimes, so, it&#39;s, you can do a lot of things. Actually, I did Aikido. I did swimming pool, squash, tennis, yeah, uh, basketball, yeah, a lot of things actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Active guy. And what about the traffic if you want to drive in Paris?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rapheal:
  </strong>
  I never tested, because as I told you it&#39;s so nice to just walk, that, and I didn&#39;t own a car but it&#39;s quite tough for people living in the suburbs cause they need a car to come, the train system is not really good. It&#39;s not like, there&#39;s a lot of delay, trains and things like that, so if you live in the suburbs you need a car, and driving through Paris in the mornings or evening is really difficult, so I just didn&#39;t want to test, you know.
