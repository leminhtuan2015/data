   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Mike, I heard that you went back to Canada and you had surgery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. I went back to Canada and I had an eye operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Get out of here!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yep. I&#39;d had complications. I&#39;m diabetic, and I had complications with my vision, and so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  With both eyes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, yes. Originally, seven years ago, I had an operation on my left eye, and following that operation, they couldn&#39;t save the eye so basically, I can&#39;t see anything out of my left eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve known you for like five years. I had no idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah. Well you can&#39;t really tell. yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   You don&#39;t have a patch or anything
  </span>
  . You know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I don&#39;t have a hook on my right arm either
  </span>
  . But, yeah, I&#39;d lost my vision seven years ago but you can&#39;t tell.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sorry. Man, I had no idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  No, hey. It&#39;s all good. In fact, I was rather lucky because I lost my vision because of diabetic complications.
  <span class="audionotes">
   As I said
  </span>
  , I&#39;m diabetic, and I was lucky because the vision in my left eye went but the vision in my right eye, the right eye was fine, so in fact they couldn&#39;t save my left eye but I still have completely good vision in my right eye and so this summer I went back to Canada to do an operation on my right eye and that operation was basically just to save the retina, the part of the eye that was affected, to save it from complications and the same thing happening that happened in the left eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, well good to hear that things went well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, things went great actually. LIke I said, I was really lucky I think in many ways, but yeah, so now I can see, you know, according to the doctors, my vision with my right eye will be fine. There might be
  <span class="audionotes">
   minor things
  </span>
  . I might need to get, you know, whatever, adjusted or whatever, but in general, my eyesight will be here to stay, so I&#39;m really lucky.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s good news.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yep.
