  James!

 <p>
  <strong>
   James:
  </strong>
  Yo!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  if you had a million dollars...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   James:
  </strong>
  Mm-hm
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  if you
  <span class="audiodef">
   won the lottery
  </span>
  ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   James:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What would you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   James:
  </strong>
  I would buy a small island, build a house there, and
  <span class="audiodef">
   invest
  </span>
  the rest of my money so that I would never have to work again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, So are you talking a
  <span class="audiodef">
   tropical island
  </span>
  , or...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   James:
  </strong>
  A tropical island, yeah, or maybe I would give it all to charity and have a bridge named after me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s two different things there. How bout the island? Would you want to be alone, on a
  <span class="audiodef">
   secluded
  </span>
  island or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   James:
  </strong>
  No, I would want all of my friends to come and visit me often.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Nice. So how would you
  <span class="audiodef">
   pass the time
  </span>
  on this island?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   James:
  </strong>
  I would read books. I would study. I would go swimming, go fishing, and play with my dog.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Do think money can make people happy, can buy happiness?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   James:
  </strong>
  No, but it can sometimes make it easier. It depends on what you buy.
