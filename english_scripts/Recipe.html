   Todd:
  </strong>
  Alexandra, you were saying that you can cook Cuban food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes, yes. It&#39;s very good stuff, and I&#39;ve got one recipe that
  <span class="audiodef">
   comes to mind
  </span>
  that has to do with chicken and rice. You can take several pieces of chicken and boil them in water with some salt until the chicken is cooked. You take out the pieces and with a couple of forks,
  <span class="audiodef">
   shred
  </span>
  the meat. In a pan you put garlic, onions, olive oil, and tomatoes. Fry that up. Put the chicken on top and then put a
  <span class="audiodef">
   puree
  </span>
  of tomatoes on top of that and just
  <span class="audiodef">
   saute
  </span>
  that for awhile and you can put it over white rice and you&#39;ll have yourself a nice meal
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that sounds pretty good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s very good, and for change you can always add green peppers, red peppers and make it very colorful, and serve it with some white plantains and a little Cuban drink and you are good to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Alright, thanks. I&#39;m gonna
  <span class="audiodef">
   give that a try
  </span>
