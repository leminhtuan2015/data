   Warren
  </b>
  : So, thanks for telling me about the ballet and
  <span class="audionotes">
   all that kind of stuff
  </span>
  , but I’m really more into sports and things like that. Do you know of any other things you can do in New York?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Oh,
  <span class="audionotes">
   absolutely
  </span>
  . There are a lot of events for a sports enthusiast in New York. We’ve got basketball. The Knicks play. They’re an NBA team. We’ve got baseball. The Yankees and the Mets play, and there’s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   feud
  </span>
  . Yankees fans hate Mets fans and Mets fans hate Yankees fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Right. They have two baseball teams.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : That’s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Exciting. We even have a Subway Series. Well, it used to be a Subway Series because the teams would play different stadiums for about a week or so and the fans would just
  <span class="audionotes">
   switch back and forth
  </span>
  from one stadium to the other. But I think they recently built one stadium for both teams.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Oh. Do you think one team is more popular than the other?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : I think probably the Yankees, unfortunately.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : The Yankees.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Yeah. My family was a Mets fan and don’t tell anyone else in my family that I said that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Oh, so I guess, they don’t
  <span class="audionotes">
   get along with
  </span>
  each other?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Oh, not at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Oh well. Well, I’m from Canada. I really like hockey. I know that you guys have the Rangers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Yeah. We do have the Rangers. They play at Madison Square Garden, so you could easily find, like, buy tickets to see a game there. That’s the same place where the Knicks play.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Oh, they both play at the same place?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Yes, they do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Maybe, I could go to a basketball and a hockey game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : You probably could if you stayed long enough. I think they have different seasons, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Oh, do they?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Yeah. Madison Square Garden is pretty big though, so maybe there’s more than one arena. I’m not sure. I’ve only been there two or three times in my life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Oh, okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Well, we also have the US Open, if you like tennis.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Yeah. That’s
  <span class="audionotes">
   held
  </span>
  in Queens, not on Manhattan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Oh, okay. What about the US Tennis Open but there’s also the US Gold Open. Is that in New York as well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : In New York? I don’t think the – is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : I’m not sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : I don’t think that the US Open for golf is in New York. I think – no, I don’t think that’s New York. Yeah. No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Okay. Have you seen tennis before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Yes, I have. I saw Serena Williams play.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Oh, she’s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : She is. Yeah. Powerful woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Yeah. I’d like to see her play.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Yeah.
