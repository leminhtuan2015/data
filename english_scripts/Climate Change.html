   Paul
  </strong>
  : So have you seen all these
  <span class="audionotes">
   freakish
  </span>
  weather events on the news all around the world?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Yeah, yeah. I&#39;m trying to pay attention, yeah. It&#39;s been pretty bad in some places. I think, it&#39;s been the wettest January on record in the UK at the moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Right, right, right. So do you think it&#39;s kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   indicative
  </span>
  of climate change? Are you a climate change believer or a climate change denier?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : I think it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   hard to deny
  </span>
  really. I think what humans do to the planet is going to have some effect and science is science, you know. It&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   backed up
  </span>
  by evidence and facts and scientists don&#39;t tend to say things until they know it&#39;s true or as true as it can be. So yeah, I&#39;m definitely a believer in climate change, I think. We are affecting things on the planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ve read quite a lot about it. And yes, there is a science to support it but there&#39;s also a lot of science to — not to deny it but there&#39;s definitely a lot of questions that aren&#39;t answered yet. It&#39;s a very sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   complex issue
  </span>
  . I mean, these global systems of weather and you&#39;ve got all these like organic processes going on that we just don&#39;t really understand. And then trying to explain all these complex events by saying it&#39;s climate change, it&#39;s…
 </p>
 <p>
  I mean, what worries me is that by denying it, it seems to also be a sort of justification for us to continue living the way we are, which worries me a lot. Whether it&#39;s true or not, I think we need to be thinking about how we can live better. And that means, living in ways that are less, sort of, damaging on our environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I agree. I agree. I&#39;ve also read a bit about weather systems that are perhaps not—because of climate of change, every planet has weather systems that come and go. And I understand that part but I also fully agree that we have to stop being so destructive.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think it&#39;s pretty clear. You can&#39;t continue cutting down
  <span class="audionotes">
   acres
  </span>
  and acres and acres of really valuable resources like the rainforest. I mean, we need that to breathe, so it just doesn&#39;t make sense. Yeah, I think we definitely have to stop being so destructive.
