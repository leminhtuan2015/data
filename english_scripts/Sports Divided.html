   Yuri:
  </strong>
  Shirley, one question. I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   a bit confused
  </span>
  now. One thing, about sports. Sometimes, I can see U.K. play something with a team. Sometimes you&#39;re all divided. Why is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  So, we are essentially still four countries, four separate countries in a united kingdom, so yeah, basically each country
  <span class="audionotes">
   just wanted
  </span>
  to keep their national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="audionotes">
   In the case of
  </span>
  the olympics, for some reason, and I&#39;m not sure of
  <span class="audionotes">
   the exact reason
  </span>
  , but the olympics committee didn&#39;t want four divided teams from Great Britain. They wanted a representative of the United Kingdom, so they basically made the rule that Great Britain had to send a team and not teams from the four individual countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, yeah, so we are United Kingdom but we&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   still very much
  </span>
  four independent countries and each country is very proud of their own national teams for football and for rugby and things like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, yeah, it&#39;s good that we get together for the olympics and we can perform as one united country.
 </p>
 <p>

   Yuri:
  </strong>
  OK, thank you very much.
