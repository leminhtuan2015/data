   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you have a good apartment in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Uh, I got one now. Yeah. It&#39;s a 2DK, 2DK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what does 2DK mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Ah, it&#39;s smaller than the 2LDK, uh, it&#39;s got a kitchen and two rooms.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah. 2LDK, maybe that it&#39;s like living room, dining room, kitchen, all in one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. So anyway, what&#39;s it like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s better than my old place. I used to live in what&#39;s called a &#34;gaijin house&#34; which is just a shared apartment. I had a 6 mat room, and a shared bathroom. Ah, not I have two 8 mat rooms, and my own bathroom, and a kitchen with 4 burners,
  <br>
  instead of 2, uh, yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow, so you&#39;re in your new place now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;m in my new place now. Actually, the old place was owned by a company, they owned the land, and this really, really, awful woman owned the building, so I rented a room from the woman. I woke up one morning and the manager was putting stuff in, was putting flyers in people&#39;s mailboxes. I took a look at the flyer. The flyer was saying that the company was going to destroy the building within a month period, so they were warning us to get out. Well, the manager was busy taking these flyers, so that the people inside the apartment wouldn&#39;t see it and move out. She wanted to get one more month of rent from us. So I took my flyer and I went down to the company that owned the land and said, &#34;Where can I live now? You&#39;re making us leave in a month.&#34; He said, &#34; Oh, I feel really bad about what you told me happened, so he gave me this 2DK, which is normally 120,000 a month for 60,000 with no key money and no deposit
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I got lucky.
 </p>
