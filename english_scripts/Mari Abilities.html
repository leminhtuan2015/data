   Ron:
  </strong>
  Hi, I&#39;m Ron from Hawaii. I&#39;m here with Mari from Japan. Today we will be talking about abilities. So, Mari, are you a good cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I like to cook,
  <span class="audionotes">
   more specifically
  </span>
  , I like to cook for people. I like to have people over and eat with people. I don&#39;t really like to eat alone, so I don&#39;t like to cook for myself. I like to cook for other people, but more than cooking I like to bake.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Baking. What do you like to bake?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Cookies and brownies and cake.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  That sounds very good. I would like to eat one of your brownies. OK, next, are you a good singer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I am terrible at singing. I don&#39;t like going to karaoke and I don&#39;t like to sing. I like music, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   I can&#39;t sing for my life
  </span>
  . I, yesterday, or I guess in class it was a students birthday and I made my students sing Happy Birthday but they wouldn&#39;t start so I had to start them off singing and my voice was so bad, they started laughing at me, so I&#39;m just a terrible singer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s funny. OK, next. Are you a good dancer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;m not a good dancer. I can&#39;t dance at all. I used to when I was younger, my parents would
  <span class="audionotes">
   enroll
  </span>
  me in ballet classes, so I did ballet for six years but I am not very good at dancing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  So, you&#39;re a teacher now right? So, were you a good student when you were a student?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I was a good student because I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   a dork
  </span>
  . No, yeah, I think I was a good student. I tried hard in all of my classes. I always did my homework. I was always focused and took notes during class. If I didn&#39;t understand something, I would either ask questions in class or speak to the teacher or professor after class. I always really liked learning and so I think that&#39;s why I was a really good student.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  And athletics? Were you a good athlete, and are you a good athlete now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   tricky question
  </span>
  . I like sports, and I like playing sports. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a very good athlete, probably compared to you, I&#39;m probably not, but I really enjoy playing sports. In high school, I played soccer. I ran cross-country. I played ice-hockey and a little bit of lacrosse.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  And which one was your favorite sport?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  My favorite sport was ice-hockey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Interesting.
