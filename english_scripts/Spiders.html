  Todd:
 </strong>
 I thought we would talk about insects. So, I warned you when you guys came over to this place that my apartment has cockroaches, spiders, and centipedes.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Centipedes. It&#39;s my only problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really! Centipedes. Why? Because they look scary?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  No, I just... all the hundred legs that they have. It&#39;s a little bit scary. Snakes are OK. Spiders is OK.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really, you don&#39;t mind snakes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Mm-hm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  See I think snakes are
  <span class="audionotes">
   much freakier
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think snakes can be pretty freaky as well, but I think centipedes are scary because of the fact that if they bite you, then it becomes dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  And you never know where they are, and they&#39;re small. You don&#39;t know where is the front, where is the back, and all the legs &#34;sch-sch-sch-sch&#34;.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I know. I know. Yeah, there&#39;re kind of... actually, I have to hang my clothes on a hanger because it&#39;s... If I hang them on a hanger, the light goes through the clothes, and I can see if they&#39;re in there or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Ooh!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, because this place is by the woods so, yeah, there&#39;s more I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  OK, cockroaches. I used to be really afraid of cockroaches. I thought they were the most
  <span class="audionotes">
   disgusting
  </span>
  little insects, but living here, they&#39;re just everywhere, that you kind of get used to them and sure, no problem anymore. I don&#39;t feel so uncomfortable around them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Nature is smart. There&#39;s always a reason why cockroaches exist, why spiders exist.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Oh, thats a good point. Spiders in your house will
  <span class="audionotes">
   take care of
  </span>
  the cockroaches, but the cockroaches will take care of the smaller spiders, or the smaller little pieces of food that might be on your floor or little things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   There you go
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s the chain. It&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   the food chain
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t have to vacuum basically.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  No, you just...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cockroaches take care of it for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Is that what I&#39;m saying?
