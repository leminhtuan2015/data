  Todd
 </strong>
 : Katia, we&#39;ve been talking about law and international law. Now you worked in Argentina for an NGO, a non government organization, related to law. What kind of courts did you work for or work with?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Actually it&#39;s one court. The Inter-American Court but also before
  <span class="audionotes">
   bringing a case
  </span>
  into the court, we had to work with the Commission, with the Inter-American Commission first so it&#39;s two different
  <span class="audionotes">
   entities
  </span>
  , the Commission and the Court.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Can you first explain the Court, so Inter-American Court that&#39;s all the countries in South America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Actually this is the countries of South America, Central America and North America, so it&#39;s North and South America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So how does the Court work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Well, the judges are from different countries of Latin American countries and the US for example or Canada and once a case is seen by the Commission, the Inter-American Commission, if the person that is suing wants to continue the sue or the state has not done what it is supposed to do, then it can be taken into the Court and then the Court will decide whether the state has committed or it&#39;s in fault or not and will give a
  <span class="audionotes">
   sentence
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So does this Court have a lot of power, like for example can other smaller countries or can any country just
  <span class="audionotes">
   ignore
  </span>
  it, ignore the ruling?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Well yes they can ignore it but it will not be seen very good by other countries. It&#39;s not an
  <span class="audionotes">
   obligation
  </span>
  . You cannot force the country to do something but it&#39;s very rare for this to happen. Maybe it takes a long time for a state to pay the victim or to do something regarding the decision but usually they do obey, most of the time.
