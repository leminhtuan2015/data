  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  So, Jeff, you asked me about what kind of job I&#39;d like. Well, what about a job you definitely you wouldn&#39;t want to do. There&#39;s lots of jobs out there and some of them aren&#39;t so good, so what would you not want to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a difficult question.
  <span class="style13">
   I don&#39;t like working period
  </span>
  , really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  <span class="style13">
   Yeah, but who does
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s right, but I think a type of job I wouldn&#39;t like to do would be an office job, a straight desk job, where it is just task work, where you get paper - maybe sort of like an accountant - where you are doing nothing but sitting at your desk sort of by yourself all day,
  <span class="audionotes">
   crunching numbers
  </span>
  or putting things into the computer. I think it&#39;s very
  <span class="audionotes">
   anti-social
  </span>
  , a little bit boring, not so healthy, and even if the pay was good, I still wouldn&#39;t want to do it because you&#39;re
  <span class="style13">
   compromising your life
  </span>
  , which is short, to something that&#39;s not so fun so maybe a desk job, something at a desk, I wouldn&#39;t like to do. How about you? What job would you not like to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, to be honest with you I don&#39;t think I would make a very good police officer. I really wouldn&#39;t want to be a police officer. I know it&#39;s exciting and it&#39;s always different but I kind of feel like I would be
  <span class="audionotes">
   judging people
  </span>
  and I&#39;m not anti-police. I think they&#39;re needed but sometimes I don&#39;t agree with everything that a government believes in and I think it would be difficult for me to be
  <span class="audionotes">
   busting people
  </span>
  for somethings that I don&#39;t agree with. And I think that, you know, it&#39;s a hard job. It&#39;s a hard job and you&#39;ve got to deal with with people that you know need help in different ways, and a police officer is just coming and putting them in jail.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Another thing, sort of related to police officer is I wouldn&#39;t want to be a nurse or a doctor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Oh, I&#39;m surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  A great job and it would be rewarding to save people&#39;s lives or to make them better if they&#39;re sick, to make them healthy again, but I hate blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I can&#39;t stand blood so if there is... I can&#39;t even stand somebody with a bloody nose so I think in a situation where there is any blood around
  <span class="audionotes">
   I wouldn&#39;t be your man
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, I think another job I wouldn&#39;t want to be is a garbage man, to be honest with you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Oh, a garbage man would be great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I understand. Like, I like the idea of driving from house to house. I think I would be a great post office worker, and I don&#39;t mind the
  <span class="audionotes">
   manual labor
  </span>
  of just lifting stuff up and stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  A bit smelly though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah. That&#39;s the biggest thing. I think the smell would really get to me, like kind of like you were with blood. I think that eventually that smell would sometimes make me sick, and you&#39;d be surprised what people people throw away. I mean, needles, all kids of things, dirty diapers. Things like that. I don&#39;t think I could deal with that very well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  OK, so you&#39;ll never be a garbage man and I&#39;ll never be a nurse.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Ah, fair enough I suppose.

   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK, Monica, today we&#39;re going to be talking about jobs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : Oh, OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And first we&#39;re going to talk about worst jobs ever. Jobs that we had in the past that we hated, so I&#39;ll go first. The worst job I&#39;ve ever had was actually working in construction. And I used to do construction with my father when I was young and I hated it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was always cold and windy and you were outside, and I just knew instantly that would never do construction. It just was
  <span class="audionotes">
   not for me
  </span>
  . Mainly because I hated working outside, especially when it was cold. When it was warm in the summer or spring it was good, but, ah, it was not good doing construction out in the cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : OK, so it was only the cold you didn&#39;t like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, mainly. Then, plus well, working for your dad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s not nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : is always
  <span class="audionotes">
   not the funnest thing
  </span>
  , but yeah, it wasn&#39;t for me. How about you? What&#39;s a job that you hated
  <span class="audionotes">
   growing up
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : Well, I didn&#39;t really enjoy working on some orchards that I had to work on when I was young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, you worked in an orchard?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : Yeah, quite often I would
  <span class="audionotes">
   work on
  </span>
  an orchard during school holidays or during holidays while I was at varsity, and some of the jobs were OK, but some involved getting up very, very early, and I didn&#39;t like that. Getting up at maybe five o&#39;clock in the morning, and getting in my car and then going out to the orchard and then having to pick apples for maybe four or five hours. It could be very tedious and boring.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I bet
  </span>
  , I bet.
