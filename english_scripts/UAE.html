  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Greg you taught in the Middle East.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I lived in the United Arab Emirates for awhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s a lot different than most places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Ah, it&#39;s very different. I&#39;m glad I went to experience another culture, another way of life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what do you remember about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Well, one thing that&#39;s so unique about the United Arab Emirates is that actually there are people from all over the world there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No kidding.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  The
  <span class="audionotes">
   native population
  </span>
  is maybe 30% of the population.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  30%.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  And the rest are foreigners who have come in to work in various ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Where do these foreigners come from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  From all over the world. You know, you have a lot of English teachers from the U.S. and England and Australia and New Zealand and Britain, and so on. You have a lot of Philippinos working as shopping, in shops, in stores, and you have people from India coming and working in construction. People from all over the world, and actually it&#39;s very
  <span class="audionotes">
   cosmopolitan
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, what&#39;s the biggest city in UAE?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Ah, it&#39;s probably Dubai.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s Dubai like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Actually, I never spent that much time in Dubai because I lived in Abu Dhab. I just went to the airport in Dubai. Abu Dhabi though, I tell you, it&#39;s really amazing. The architecture is really beautiful. The Arabic architecture is just amazing. The mosques. The marble on the building, really, beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  In Abu Dhabi though, did you live in a house, or did you live in an apartment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  I lived in an apartment on the 14th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The 14th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  The 14th floor. Oh, it&#39;s, Abu Dhabi is amazing. You know, maybe 50 years ago, there were just some small villages, but after oil was discovered, and the country became rich, there was like an
  <span class="audionotes">
   explosion in the population
  </span>
  and new buildings were going up every day. They&#39;re growing like mushrooms. I could see the ocean, though from my apartment. I remember how beautiful the ocean was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, what&#39;s the cuisine like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Ah, the food is amazing. Because you have people from all over the world, you have food from all over the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s the local food? Is it
  <span class="audionotes">
   rice-based
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Oh, they eat rice, and a lot of, camel meat, camel meat is unusual and the cheeses are really salty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, camel mea, cheese, and rice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  And a lot of Mediterranean foods too. Dates, the dates were fantastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  I never liked dates before I went there, and the olives. The olives are also wonderful.
