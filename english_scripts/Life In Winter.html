 Hi, Aiste.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Hello, Christophe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  So, how is Lithuania in like in wintertime?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Oh, LIthuania is very cold in the wintertime. Usually we have snow from the beginning of November till the beginning of April. That means almost five months of snow, but the good thing about snow is that after
  <span class="audionotes">
   miserable
  </span>
  autumn, where it rains every day, and when the snow starts falling, you have white the atmosphere everywhere, and when people walk in snow, they&#39;re not that unhappy and not that desperate anymore, so I actually like snow because snow keeps your
  <span class="audionotes">
   mood
  </span>
  up. What about Belgium in wintertime?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Belgium in wintertime is really miserable. It&#39;s raining all the time, almost every day rain, rain, rain. It&#39;s so miserable that people just look at the pavement when they are walking outside all the time. They look like they&#39;re so depressed.
  <span class="audionotes">
   There&#39;s only one thing in their heads
  </span>
  , &#34;Oh, I hope it will be spring time soon.&#34; But, I was wondering, if it&#39;s snowing in Lithuania, isn&#39;t it cold?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Oh, it is very cold. Just a few years ago we had a temperature that reached minus 26 in wintertime. It was really freezing. You almost can&#39;t get out of your house. Once you get out, your eyelashes get frozen, and when you get inside, you&#39;re just naturally crying because the ice is melting and running all through your face.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  How do you heat your houses when it&#39;s so cold?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Well, when it&#39;s so cold, it&#39;s really a problem to heat your house at the
  <span class="audionotes">
   proper
  </span>
  temperature, and it definitely costs a lot of money. So far I don&#39;t have my house and I live with my parents, so my father was taking care of that. He was combining three heating parts with two different kinds of wood and also natural gas from central heating system and by combining this three parts of heating system, he was heating up the house, but still when it was minus 26, once the pipes were frozen, and it was really a huge problem to make the system running back again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Wow, that sounds like a really complicated and expensive heating system. I prefer rain in my country then.
