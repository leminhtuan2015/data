  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Hello, Silvia. I want to ask you a question. Whether you collect or hold onto things too much?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  I think too much is
  <span class="audionotes">
   an understatement
  </span>
  , actually. I do have a lot of stuff in my room. A lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  And you live in another country right now. Right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and I&#39;m actually worrying a lit bit about how I&#39;m going to take everything back home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  OK, so what sort of things do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   hold onto
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Well, now I have from every country I&#39;ve visited I always get a magnet of the country. Well, that doesn&#39;t have, you know, it&#39;s small.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it doesn&#39;t take up that much space.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  But then, I love to buy handbags. And I have
  <span class="audionotes">
   tons of
  </span>
  handbags that I have no idea what I&#39;m going to do with actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  How many handbags do you own?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Thirty, plus home another thirty, so ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think maybe I have to get rid of a few.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I think so too. And do you collect anything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Ah, actually no. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t live at home anymore. I live overseas, so I think the first time that I moved from one city to another, I used to have a lot of stuff, but then I realized how difficult it was to move everything, so I think I just got to the point where I didn&#39;t want to be packing stuff all the time, so I tried to throw everything away. I mean everything that I don&#39;t really, really need, I tried to not buy it, or just
  <span class="audionotes">
   let it go
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  I think with guys it&#39;s easier right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Maybe it&#39;s a bit easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  With girls, I don&#39;t want to get rid of clothes that I haven&#39;t worn in a year or I have a lot of shoes as well and they take a lot of space. I was trying to get rid of a few things the other day and I counted thirty-five pairs of shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I know. So, yeah, I think I should have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   yardsale
  </span>
  or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I think so too. And I think the more you move around, the less things you want to have because you know you have to pay more when you move to another place, and it&#39;s very annoying to put everything in two boxes and suitcases and everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;m learning that now actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes, I think you should stop buying purses.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  I know. Wish me luck with the packing.
