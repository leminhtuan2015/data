  Todd:
 </strong>
 So Monica, this week we’re going to talk about technology and how maybe technology changes patterns of how we read and how we write, so let’s talk about reading. Do you think you read fewer books now because of the Internet?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  I don’t think I read fewer books now because of the Internet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you still read quite a bit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, recently I’ve been reading quite a bit, but I think it’s more to do with how much spare time I have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you don’t think that the internet
  <span class="audionotes">
   eats into
  </span>
  reading time at all? At least for you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  I would have to say no because I use the internet for slightly different reasons. I use the internet to check my e-mail and communicate with my friends, but reading a book is something completely different that I do for relaxation. So yeah, I don’t think it has impacted the amount that I read.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you see, for me I think it’s
  <span class="audionotes">
   the exact opposite
  </span>
  , it’s pretty bad. I pretty much read everything online, magazines or newspapers, and occasionally I’ll still buy a newspaper but I’ve completely stopped reading books. I just do not read books anymore and I think
  <span class="audionotes">
   I’m not alone
  </span>
  ...I’ve read online, ironically, of other people who say that they’ve stopped reading books because you’re so used to reading online now that the actual process of sitting down and reading a book just isn’t as enjoyable as it used to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   having said that
  </span>
  it doesn’t affect how much I read, I have to say that I have stopped reading newspapers in hard copy form. I tend to check the news items on the websites so, yeah, in that regard, I do read less than I used to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you buy newspapers quite rarely?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, exactly. I’m also concerned about the environment so I sort of feel that if I can get the news from the Internet then it’s saving all the trees being cut down and printed into a newspaper form.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   that’s a good way to look at it
  </span>
  .
