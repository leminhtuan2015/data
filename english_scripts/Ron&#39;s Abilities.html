  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m Mari from Japan and I&#39;m here with Ron from Hawaii. Today we are going to be talking about abilities so let&#39;s start with food. Can you cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I can&#39;t cook well, but I do cook, so I think the reason why I can&#39;t cook well is because I can eat anything, so I don&#39;t try very hard to make it take good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What do you like to cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I like to barbecue outside on the
  <span class="audionotes">
   grill
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What do you put on your barbecue?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  When I cook meat, I don&#39;t put much, only salt, pepper, and a little bit of seasoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  OK. Good. Next, do you think you&#39;re a good dancer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a good dancer and I don&#39;t really try to be a good dancer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Do you not like to dance?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t like to dance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   At all?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I heard that you&#39;re a good
  <span class="audionotes">
   line-dancer
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I would like to learn how to line dance, and I do like country music but I haven&#39;t been
  <span class="audionotes">
   officially
  </span>
  taught how to line dance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari
  </strong>
  : So you don&#39;t dance at all?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Next, are you a good singer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;m not a good singer but I do enjoy going to Karaoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What do you like to sing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  In Hawaii, when I go to Karaoke I enjoy singing Hawaiian music. If I&#39;m in Japan I like to sing other English songs that they have, usually country music or 80&#39;s or 90&#39;s music.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Good. That&#39;s good. Do you think you&#39;re a good student?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m a good student. Growing up I was not a good student but now I am trying harder to be a good student.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  How were you not a good student growing up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I didn&#39;t enjoy going to school and I didn&#39;t try very hard in school. Now I try a little harder. I make an effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Can you talk more about your effort? What do you do to try to be a good student?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I try to listen to the teachers now instead of
  <span class="audionotes">
   doing my own thing
  </span>
  , and I try to complete everything with good quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s good. And, last do you think that you&#39;re a good athlete?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Growing up I was a good athlete. I played a few sports. Now I don&#39;t play any sports anymore because I&#39;m old, but growing up I think I was a good athlete.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What sports did you play?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I played American football, baseball, and soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Which one is your best sport?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I would say football. American football is my best sport.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  How long did you play?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I played since I was eleven until age twenty-two.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  So for eleven years. And you played when you were in university?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I played at the University of Hawaii.
