   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hey, Todd, where do you live?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I live on the east side of downtown
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh. Do you like it there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I do. I live in an older house. But it&#39;s a big house, and it&#39;s really relaxing. It&#39;s a nice place to live.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow. Sounds nice. How many rooms does it have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : My house is pretty big. It&#39;s four rooms. It has a big sleeping room. It&#39;s a Japanese house. So it&#39;s not really a bedroom because you sleep on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But it also has a living room. It has, like, an office room and it has a kitchen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Is it a big kitchen?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No, it&#39;s a pretty small kitchen and it&#39;s a very old kitchen. I have a small
  <span class="audionotes">
   stove
  </span>
  . So it&#39;s very difficult to cook. But, you know, I have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   refrigerator
  </span>
  . I have a microwave. I have a nice kitchen table to eat at. So it&#39;s a pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   decent
  </span>
  kitchen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It sounds okay. What about your living room? What do you have in the living room?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : My living room, it&#39;s pretty cool for a guy because it&#39;s a good place to watch sports. I have a really big TV, and I have cable TV, so I get all the football channels.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And I have a really big sofa, so I can sit on my sofa and watch sports and drink beer. It&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Sounds relaxing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Very relaxing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Well, do you also have a nice bathroom?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I do. I actually have three bathrooms.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s kind of crazy, yes. So in English, we say bathroom, but I have two rooms that are for the toilet, and I have one room or the bathroom with the toilet for the guests. And then I have a bathroom that I use. And then also I have a natural
  <span class="audionotes">
   hot spring
  </span>
  bath outside my house. So if I want to take a shower or bathe, I use that room.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow. I&#39;d love to have a hot spring at my house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it&#39;s very nice. It&#39;s very, very nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Does your house also have a yard?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It kind of has a yard. So outside my house, there&#39;s an area for flowers and
  <span class="audionotes">
   bushes
  </span>
  . And it&#39;s like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a yard
  </span>
  or a garden around the house, but it&#39;s not a place you can play sports. There&#39;s no grass or anything. So it&#39;s a very, very small yard. But, you know, it&#39;s a nice place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah. It sounds like a nice place to live.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It is a nice place to live. I&#39;m very, very lucky.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : You said you have a sleeping room, not a bedroom. What does that mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I live at a Japanese style house. So it&#39;s called the tatami room. And you sleep in the tatami room and you sleep on the floor on a futon. So I don&#39;t have a bed. So it&#39;s not a bedroom. It&#39;s a room that you sit in during the day and you can eat and talk with guests. But it&#39;s also a room that you sleep in at night. So yeah, I call it my sleeping room.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I think in Japan, they just call it the tatami room.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Is it comfortable sleeping on the floor?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it&#39;s really comfortable. Now I love it. So before, I slept on a bed. But now I sleep on the futon on the floor and I really like it. Actually, I prefer to sleep on the futon on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Well, it sounds like your house is really comfortable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It is. It is. I never want to leave.
