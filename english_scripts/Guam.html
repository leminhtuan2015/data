  Nick:
 </strong>
 So, I don’t know much about Guam. I’d barely heard of Guam until last year so please, tell me something about it. What’s life like?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Well, most people have never heard about Guam. Most people who do hear about it are mostly Americans and even then most of these Americans that do hear about it, they have family in the
  <span class="audionotes">
   military
  </span>
  or they know a friend in the military and that’s because Guam is a big US base, a
  <span class="audionotes">
   military base
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Guam is a little island in the middle of the Pacific. It’s actually five hours from where you’re from, Nick, five hours from Australia. And it’s about four hours from Hong Kong and three and a half from Japan. So you can kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   gauge
  </span>
  based on those numbers just how much in the middle of the Pacific Ocean Guam is. It’s about eighteen miles wide and thirty-two miles long so it’s pretty, pretty small.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  So it’s a part of America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it’s a part of America. The US military base there is actually the biggest in Asia besides the one in Okinawa which is the islands south of Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it is supposedly the closest
  <span class="audionotes">
   US soil
  </span>
  ...not supposedly, it is the closest US soil to Asia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Oh really? And it look like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   tropical paradise
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is very much like Hawaii which is an island of the coast of the mainland US. It’s got lots and lots of palm trees, blue waters, and white sand. Lots and lots and lots of water sports are available...scuba diving spots, it’s actually a paradise, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  I definitely want to go.
