   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hello, Adrienne!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Hi, Todd!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How are you?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Fine, how are you?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Good. Adrienne, can we talk about what you like to do on Sunday morning?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Usually, on Sunday mornings, I like to sleep as late as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sleep, huh! Like how late do you normally sleep?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Um, probably until 10 or 11 o&#39;clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ooh, that&#39;s pretty late.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I know. That&#39;s the best part.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s terrible actually.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not terrible. It&#39;s good for you. You can catch up on your sleep, from a busy week.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but don&#39;t you think you&#39;re giving away the best time of the day. Like that&#39;s, if you sleep, you give away that time. You&#39;re never going to have it back.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  But, it&#39;s also relaxing which is something that you don&#39;t get to do during the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mm, that&#39;s true. That&#39;s true. But for me, it&#39;s, I like to get up early. I mean, do you ever get up early on Saturday or Sunday?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Ah, sometimes, if I have an activity planned for the day - errands, shopping, hiking - that kind of thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, what about food. What do you normally eat?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  On Sundays? I like to make an omelet for breakfast, ah, cheese omelet usually.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do you put inside the omelet besides cheese?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Mushrooms (Ooh, that&#39;s good) and sometimes avocado, if I can find it. It&#39;s delicious.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you do this every Sunday?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  No, it&#39;s not a habit but when I can, when I think of it, when I&#39;m up early enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, let&#39;s talk about last sunday? What did you do last Sunday? Do you remember?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Mm, last Sunday? I was packing.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Packing for what?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  To come to Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah! So where did you come from?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I came from Minneapolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. How long was your flight?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  14 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ooh, that&#39;s long!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Give or take, yeah.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did you sleep on the plane?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I did. 2 hours, and then I was up, and then 1 hour, and then I was up, and then 20 minutes and then 40 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, it was never solid?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  No, sporadic. We had a lot of turbulence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ooh, what&#39;s turbulence?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Turbulence is when the plane hits some kind of air pockets and bounces around. You have to put your seatbelt on so you don&#39;t get knocked over.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, they go &#34;bong!&#34;
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Exactly!

  I had a really nice day today. It&#39;s Sunday today, so obviously I got nothing to do so I went to meet my English friend Ben in a place called Harajuku in Tokyo, which is a great place to hang out in on Sundays anyway, but we found this amazing sushi restaurant that we used to go to together every time we meet up. Sundays usually our day for meeting up together cause he lives in Yokohama which is quite a long way away from me. So I don&#39;t ever see him during the week. Anyway, this sushi restaurant we found is the best one I&#39;ve eaten at in Tokyo. It&#39;s one of those ones with all the sushi on a little conveyor belt, that goes along, but it doesn&#39;t just do raw fish it does all the different meats. It does little hamburgers on rice, little bits of bacon on rice, melon, salad, and also loads of puddings. We ended up I think eating about 7 puddings between us today. Um, it&#39;s, the pricing system really good. It&#39;s done on, the, how many plates you eat, and each plate is different color and that&#39;s a different price and it&#39;s so cheap and you end up, just gorging yourself eating loads and loads, for really a very cheap price, so after that we were both stuffed, and left the restaurant, went to a, up to a place in Harajuku where all the crazy kids hang out wearing costume. Had a look around there. Took some pictures and then walked along the road together about 15 minutes to a place called Shibuya which is really one of the good sort of trendy young shopping, hanging out places in Tokyo, um, just so crowded all the time,
 </p>
 <p>
  but today they were having a Matsuri festival on, where all the sort of people from the local different sort of dojos and clubs get together and carry this big heavy thing through the streets all in there traditional Japanese clothes, and all that chanting and singing and whistling, so that was really nice to see. We decided we wanted to go to the cinema to see a new film that has just come out so we walked all around Shibuya looking for cinemas and everyone we went to didn&#39;t have this film, wasn&#39;t playing this film, so we gave up on that in the end. Ben went home and I went into one of the shopping centers in Shibuya looking for souvenirs for my friends, cause it&#39;s getting to that time now where I gotta start thinking I&#39;m leaving Japan in a month and there&#39;s just my list of presents that I&#39;ve got to get for people, a number of people I&#39;ve got to get things for is just getting longer and longer as I keep on remembering more and more people, so I&#39;ve stuffed my souvenir buying now and I think Shibuya, as far as my girlfriend&#39;s is concerned is the best to buy stuff.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Raphael, I&#39;m going to ask you about Sunday. OK, what do you like to do on Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  What do I like to do on Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, I think it&#39;s changing every Sunday. I like to go see some exhibits, art exhibitions or things like that. I like to go to the cinema. I like to stay home when it&#39;s really rainy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like last weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, exactly. And sometimes I&#39;m doing just nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What time do you usually get up on Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Well, quite late I guess, like 10 o&#39;clock or 11. It&#39;s not really late but, late enough, and.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. I&#39;m an early riser so. What do you normally eat for breakfast on Sunday morning?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  I guess the same thing as everyday, like cereals and toast.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  No difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You never have brunch or anything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  No, because it takes a lot of time to cook and I like spending my time like doing or composing, so I don&#39;t, I mean, I care what I eat but I don&#39;t do a lot of time for preparing so I basically eat the same things every morning.
