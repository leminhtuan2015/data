  Montreal in the summer is beautiful temperature. It&#39;s about 25 to 32 degrees. Not very humid. The days are warm. The nights are cooler and it is a wonderful place. You can go to Old Montreal which is very European. You can go to downtown Montreal, tons of shopping. You can go to the canals where you can go whitewater rafting if you want, all in the city of Montreal. With the distance, because Montreal is quite a small city, you can walk, or it&#39;s a fifteen, twenty minute car ride wherever you want to go.

  The nightlife in Montreal is sometimes
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    even better
   </span>
  </span>
  than the day life. Montreal, because of the French and English influences, there are different areas where you can go and get
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    different aspects
   </span>
  </span>
  of Montreal culture, so during the evening in old Montreal it is filled with Jazz clubs or very Quebec, French folk songs and
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    folk performances
   </span>
  </span>
  . Cafe life in Montreal is very, very important, so you can sit outside in cafe&#39;s as well as there are many bars.
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    Huge party scene
   </span>
  </span>
  . Great DJ&#39;s. Then you can also go to Cresent Street, which is a popular street with beautiful bars. The famous auto racer, 
                                
                                
                                Jacques Villeneuve   has a bar there, and that&#39;s really where a lot of the, a lot of the tourists as well as well as people visiting from Hollywood, a lot of the stars hang out around Cresent Street. Also, the restaurants in Montreal are fabulous because Montreal is so
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    diverse culturally
   </span>
  </span>
  , you have great greek food, great Jewish food, great Italian food, great Chinese food, great french food of course.
