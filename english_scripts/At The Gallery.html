    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, hello there. Can I help you?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Hi, I&#39;m just looking at some of your paintings here. You have a really nice store here.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes that&#39;s right, we do don&#39;t we? We have some really nice paintings in here.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   I think I really like this one. Can you tell me a bit about it?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Certainly, yes. Now that one&#39;s actually by a local painter. His name&#39;s John Mansfield and he&#39;s been painting since he was 14 actually, although he died in 1999 so he painted for about 53 years in total. I really like that one myself actually.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   So he died? That means that there aren&#39;t many of his paintings left.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s right, yes. I mean most of his paintings are one-offs and this one is a one-off.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, OK. Well I especially like the colours of this one. I like how it&#39;s bright and it looks really nice and I like how it depicts the local landscape.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes, that&#39;s true. It is really nice isn&#39;t it? Actually this is a picture of a local walking route which is quite famous and quite popular with hikers. A lot of people go there on walks particularly at the weekend. And if you look on the left hand side there, that tree is the oldest tree in the area.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, is that right? Have you ever been to this place?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes I&#39;ve been there quite often actually and it looks very much like this in the spring.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well if John Mansfield is a local painter, have you ever met him when he was alive?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes, he often use to come into this shop. He was a very devoted painter and he really enjoyed buying paintings by different painters in the area.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Really? Well that sounds really interesting. How much is this painting?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   That one&#39;s actually a hundred and eighty pounds.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Wow! 180 pounds!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes I&#39;m afraid so.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well that&#39;s a bit beyond my budget. Would you be able to give it to me for 100 pounds?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Mm, I think a hundred is too cheap.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well let&#39;s see. This other painting looks quite nice too. How about if I buy both of them? Would you be able to give it to me for maybe 250 pounds?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Why don&#39;t we say three hundred and you&#39;ve got yourself a deal.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Three hundred? That sounds good. Thanks a lot. I&#39;ll take it.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   OK then.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Great!
