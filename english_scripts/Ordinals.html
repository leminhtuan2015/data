  : Hello. Are you the new teacher?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I am, yes. My name&#39;s Natalie. What&#39;s your name?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m Todd. Nice to meet you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  : Welcome to the school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
  : Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What is your morning schedule?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : First period, I teach Math.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So do I. I teach Math first period, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, cool. After that, for second period, I teach French.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You speak French?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I do. [French 00:00:30].
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s great. Well, I speak some Japanese, so I teach Japanese second period.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s so cool. I wish I spoke Japanese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, but my Japanese is not very good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : But I&#39;m the only teacher that speaks Japanese, so I teach Japanese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Maybe you could teach me one day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Maybe, but I don&#39;t know much. How about third period? What do you teach third period?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Third period, I teach English.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ah. I teach English, too. Our schedules are very similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I know, although it is my first day. I&#39;m a little nervous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about the afternoon schedule? What do you teach fourth period?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Fourth period, I think I have Physics.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, you teach Physics?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I love Physics. Do you teach Physics?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No, I don&#39;t teach Physics, but I teach Math. I teach Math fourth period.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh. What do you teach in fifth period?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : In fifth period, that&#39;s the sports period. I am the cross-country coach.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh. I have sports, too, but I&#39;m the coach for swimming.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, really? Are you a good swimmer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I think I&#39;m a really good swimmer. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I can swim, but I&#39;m not a good swimmer. I like running.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, I hate running. How far do you run?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, for the class, usually we run 5K every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Wow! 5K. Sixth period, I hear that&#39;s our teaching hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Sixth period, we are in the classroom, but the students are free. They can do what they want. But students can come to class and ask questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, cool. Do lots of students come and ask questions?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Some students come, but not too many.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, this is your first day and your first week, so maybe the job will be a little crazy. But I think after your second or third week, the job will be very, very easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I hope so. I&#39;m really excited to meet the students. They seem great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, I think the students will like you a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, I hope so, too. Maybe if you have some time, you could give me a tour of the school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Sure. I&#39;d love to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Great. Thanks.
