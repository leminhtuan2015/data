   Vesna
  </strong>
  : Tell me Karlo, is Pula your home town?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Karlo
  </strong>
  : Yes, I was born in Pula, did all of my schooling here and I also work here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vesna
  </strong>
  : And do you like living in Pula?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Karlo
  </strong>
  : Of course. All of my memories are connected to this city. My parents live here as well as all of other loved ones. You know, the old saying, &#39;home is where the heart is&#39;.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vesna
  </strong>
  : Does that mean if your heart leads you somewhere else, you would follow it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Karlo
  </strong>
  : I have an
  <span class="audionotes">
   open mind
  </span>
  about it. If I left I would probably be
  <span class="audionotes">
   nostalgic
  </span>
  at first. But in time, sure, I would find another place to call home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vesna
  </strong>
  : How would you describe Pula to somebody who was considering moving here?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Karlo
  </strong>
  : What suits me in the city is that it&#39;s rather small so everything is
  <span class="audionotes">
   at hand
  </span>
  , you can say. If you don&#39;t mind walking you can manage all of your activities by foot. It is also quite peaceful, there is not much isolation or surprises.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vesna
  </strong>
  : Yes, yes, that can be a
  <span class="audionotes">
   downside
  </span>
  sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Karlo
  </strong>
  : Yes, sometimes because in my opinion there is a lack of cultural and entertaining activities throughout the year, especially for the young people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vesna
  </strong>
  : Yeah, and you are younger. How do you and your friends find entertainment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Karlo
  </strong>
  : Pula has a rich rock and roll history, that gives you a better perception for creativity and development. There is a 19th military complex called ------, that was thrown into our cultural center. So most of us are somewhat engaged there. I, for example, I&#39;m a member of a hardrock band.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vesna
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s nice. Are there any public performances held in that center?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Karlo
  </strong>
  : Yes, yes, all the time. It&#39;s a multicultural social center that gathers over 100 organisations and associations.
  <span class="audionotes">
   From time to time
  </span>
  you can see music performances, then shows which play, music exhibitions and other artistic performances.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vesna
  </strong>
  : Great. And are there any other places in Pula you would wish to point out?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Karlo
  </strong>
  : This city has beautiful nature and historical treasures, it has a mild climate and great past. It&#39;s witnesses are the names of buildings that we inherited and that we are so proud of, mostly from the Roman period, but also from the other times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vesna
  </strong>
  : Do you think this is a globally known fact?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Karlo
  </strong>
  : No. I think that this city needs better marketing and presentation of what it has to offer. We just haven&#39;t learned to use its benefits yet.
