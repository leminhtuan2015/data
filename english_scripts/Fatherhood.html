   Todd:
  </strong>
  Norm, you have three children, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Norm:
  </strong>
  Yes, I do. I&#39;m very lucky.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do your Children do? What kind of jobs do they have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Norm:
  </strong>
  Well, my oldest one, he works for Frito lay, which is a company owned by Pepsi Cola. He&#39;s a regional manager, which means he has the whole province of Ontario, and he is responsible for distribution for, he handles big budgets, we&#39;re talking about millions of dollars here, and he is a problem solver. When an area does not make profit, or if they have problems then they send him there to fix the problems. He&#39;s very good at that. He has very good human communication skills and he sees problems and he sees solutions that please everyone, so he&#39;s very successful. I have, my daughter, who does many things. She works in the circus industry. She teaches at L&#39;arc de cirque in Quebec, and she&#39;s also has her own busker act with a friend and she also teaches trampoline at the circus school, and she also competes. She&#39;s an international athlete. She came in 7th at the world competitions in Hamburg last fall, and synchronized trampoline. And my youngest son, he&#39;s in computers. He enjoys it very much. He works for a big consulting company. They have contracts, government contracts, and he sets up the data base and trains the government people so that they can use the computers to, for example, monitor medical files of the people and the province.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, you must be really proud. You have three amazing kids.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Norm:
  </strong>
  Thank you. Thank you. They worked very hard. Yes, and they&#39;re, they like also to experience different things so there all in that kind of field where they can change job when they find that the job is not as interesting anymore, so they ask for transfers and, that&#39;s the way they like it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, you&#39;re one cool guy Norman. I&#39;m not surprised that you have three successful children.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   So, Mark, I see you have beautiful pictures of your child up here. I didn’t know you had a baby!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Yeah, baby Roy is about 1 year and 4 months old now.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh wow, that’s exciting!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Yeah I mean everyone said there would be lots of changes in your life, but it’s probably changed my wife’s life more than mine. But I still enjoy giving him his bath and helping put him to bed and playing with him in the mornings and at the weekend.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, that’s great. So, what’s it like being a father?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   A lot of fun. As I said, I think my wife has a harder job looking after him during the day. The father can have the good jobs in the evening and the early morning and at the weekend.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So is your child speaking yet?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Not quite, but he understands English and Japanese. So if we tell him off in either language he runs away and starts crying. He’s just started walking.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Ok, oh that’s got to be tough.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   It’s getting tougher. We just have to childproof the house more.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So how do you childproof the house?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Make sure that all breakables are above the level where he can reach, that’s the most important thing.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Now, when you have a child, like, first of all how much does the baby sleep?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Well he’s a good sleeper. He’s basically always slept from about 9 in the morning, 9 in the evening until 6.30 or 7 in the morning. He’s waking up a little bit earlier now because it’s lighter earlier.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, wow, so what does your child like to do? Do you play special games with your …, with Roy?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   He’s into dancing at the moment. He really likes the beat of the BBC world music so he looks forward to the BBC news at the hour. He likes going to the sandpit and playing with the other children from the neighbourhood.
