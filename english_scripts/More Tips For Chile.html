  Olga
 </strong>
 : The next place?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : The next place would be well Santiago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t really
  <span class="audionotes">
   look forward
  </span>
  to going to Santiago. I would rather go to some other place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK then. Then if it&#39;s around like the center of the country, I would recommend you to go to Easter Island.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Oh, I&#39;ve heard about it. The place where they have those big statues, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Right. Do you know the names of them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Actually no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK. They&#39;re called Moai statues. Yes, and you can see them. If you take a plane from Santiago, it will take you around five hours and you can see the
  <span class="audionotes">
   indigenous
  </span>
  people. You can see the statues and
  <span class="audionotes">
   if you&#39;re lucky
  </span>
  you can stay in a house with an indigenous family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Actually those families, do they speak Spanish?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : They do speak Spanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : But they also speak their local language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Maybe I can learn.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I think you can learn if you live like, if you stay with a family for a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : It is thoroughly different from Spanish, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : It is. It&#39;s more close, it&#39;s more closer to the Polynesia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : I see. That&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : But it&#39;s really interesting and the island it&#39;s really beautiful and if you go in summer you can swim and it&#39;s going to be a really, really good time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s not expensive to go there, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s about five hundred dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s OK. Yeah, I can
  <span class="audionotes">
   manage
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : You have to be careful though because the prices in the island are a bit more expensive than...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah, they do that sometimes in Mexico too. Yeah, touristic places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yeah. And if you want to go south, I can recommend you Patagonia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I heard it&#39;s really hard to go there. Is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well it&#39;s really hard to get there if you go on the Chilean part but if you go on the Argentinian part it&#39;s not that difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Then I think we want to go there too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : And it&#39;s beautiful because you have a lot of mountains, rivers,
  <span class="audionotes">
   glaciers
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : It sounds so romantic too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s good that you go with a boyfriend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Thank you. I&#39;m looking forward to go there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Good. If you need any other advice just let me know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : You&#39;re welcome.
