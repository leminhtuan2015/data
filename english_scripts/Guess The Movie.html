  Todd
 </strong>
 : Okay, guys. We will do another guessing game. This time, guess the movie.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Sounds fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. This movie is very famous. It&#39;s about 20 years old, maybe 18 years old. And it is about a love story and about two people that meet on a big ship and the ship sinks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh, it&#39;s really, really famous. Is it Titanic?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You&#39;re right. Ping-pong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Titanic. Titanic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. The next movie is also a famous movie, but I never saw this movie, but I know about the movie. And the movie is about a fight. A fight between two creatures, and both creatures, monsters, come from the ocean. They come out of the ocean and they fight each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Two monsters from the ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Sometimes, they fight in Japan but the last movie, the monsters fight in America. I think they fight in San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Ah, is it Godzilla?
 </p>
 <p>

  : Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. So the next movie is also a movie many teenage boys like, and it&#39;s also about fighting. And it&#39;s about machines that fight each other. And I think the machines come from space. So the machines are not from earth and machines can change, and the machines have special powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Machines that have special powers and change.
 </p>
 <p>

  </strong>
  : Yes, Transformers. Ping-pong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. So now, I&#39;m going to go way back. Way back. So this is a movie, also about an alien. And this alien is very kind and the alien is very shy and the alien meets a boy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh, I know it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And they become friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Do they ride a bicycle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : They do ride a bicycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s ET.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s right. Ping-pong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Yes!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Good job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. So now, one more movie. Okay. So this movie is also old. This movie is maybe over 25 years old â€“ oh, over 20 years old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m better at the old ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. And in this movie, there is a scientist. And the scientist is trying to find a special treasure, and he goes all around the world and he needs to find a special treasure. And he goes to Egypt. He goes to Asia. And he wants to find something but he has to fight people in the movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
  : I think it&#39;s Indiana Jones.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
