   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Hi, Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How are you doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Good, how are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Pretty good. Kanade, you talk about your
  <span class="audiodef">
   little sister
  </span>
  a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Yes, I like her. Her name is Asuka. She&#39;s a university student now. She&#39;s two years younger than I and we are so
  <span class="audiodef">
   close
  </span>
  so we see each other more than twice in a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  People say we don&#39;t
  <span class="audiodef">
   look like
  </span>
  each other, we don&#39;t look similar, but sometimes we see, we look very similar in the pictures. She lives in Tokyo so we can have some coffee on the weekends or go shopping sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what did you sister give you as your last birthday gift?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Birthday gift? We don&#39;t really give the birthday gift instead but we give each other some small
  <span class="audiodef">
   letter
  </span>
  or something in normal day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Yeah, surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Are you
  <span class="audiodef">
   in contact with
  </span>
  each other every day by e-mail
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Every day, almost every day or sometimes the phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you guys ever fight?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Ah, not really. I really like her so always, when she always asks me something I always do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! What a good big sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  I know that!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s sweet. Well, if you&#39;re sister is listeing what would you like to tell
  <br>
  her right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m always with you so, you can do whatever you want.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, you&#39;re a nice sister. Thanks a lot Kanade.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Thank you, Todd.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Santi, we&#39;re talking about family this week and you have a sister, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes, a sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, what&#39;s kind of unique about your sister is you both are similar in age and you go to university together, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes, only two years younger than me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, yeah, you are 22?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Twenty-two.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  She&#39;s twenty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s it like going to university with your sister?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s kind of like difficult because I have to take care of her, but it&#39;s also fun because you can share things with her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what do you mean, like, you have to take care of her?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m in my fourth year right now, so I&#39;m kind of like ... not busy, so whatever she wants to have for dinner, I have to cook.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really, you cook for her?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes. Yes, she&#39;s my sister. I&#39;m a good sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s very nice. So what kind of things to you cook for your sister?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Basically Chinese food or lunch packets for her, for like tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You make your sister a lunch to take to school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s like a mother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. That&#39;s care and devotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Well, I said before I&#39;m a good sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. I guess so. Now when you first went to university, did you think your sister would join you - would go to the same university?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  No. I don&#39;t think so because, well, she&#39;s very good at chemistry and she&#39;s also good at science, so I&#39;m hoping that she will go a different directions than me, but, well, I don&#39;t know, maybe my mother trusts me, and then my mother led her to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What about similarities and differences? How would you say you and your sister are similar?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  My voice and her voice. It&#39;s totally the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So if your sister was here doing audio work, I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell who was who.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes. It&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Sometimes we like to
  <span class="audionotes">
   play with people
  </span>
  on the phone. It&#39;s kind of like bad but whenever her friends call, I will pretend that I was her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  And vice-versa.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That is a funny joke. So what is something that&#39;s different? Like how are you different? Obviously she&#39;s good in science.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and, well, the appearance is different. She has darker skin, and then she&#39;s very slim.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You are very slim, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Are you the same height?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  No. I&#39;m taller.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So you really are the big sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You
  <span class="audionotes">
   look down on
  </span>
  her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes. Sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So do you guys fight very much, or
  <span class="audionotes">
   do you usually get along
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Uh, during my childhood - yes - but now - no - we just ... well, we
  <span class="audionotes">
   know the limits
  </span>
  . We know that we are ready beginning to be adults, so I don&#39;t think that fight is kind of like popular anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so you guys are like
  <span class="audionotes">
   two peas in a pod
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
