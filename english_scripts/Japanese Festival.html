   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Yoko we were just at a
  <span class="audiodef">
   festival
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you want to talk about festivals in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yes, OK. So, I think in Fall we have lots of kind of festivals, but it depends on the places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What are some things that most festivals have, like, what can you see if you go to a Japanese festival?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Omikoshi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Omikoshi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yes. Do you know the word?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I think so. What is Omikoshi?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Ah, it&#39;s really difficult for me to explain in English, but Omokishi looks like a bigbox, lots of people,
  <span class="audiodef">
   adult people
  </span>
  try to carry together, and they usually go to temples, and they
  <span class="audiodef">
   kind of
  </span>
  celebrate a harvest or our happiness or those kind of things
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Do you ever carry the Omikoshi?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Ah, you know, I&#39;m not a strong guy so, I&#39;ve never tried it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What about foods? What kind of foods do people
  <span class="audiodef">
   like
  </span>
  to eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  We can see lots of small shops along the street and we can buy really Japanese food, like watagashi, it&#39;s a really sweet candy but it looks like, how do you say that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know either. White small stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  White small stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Sorry. You should see it. So it&#39;s watagashi or watame. It&#39;s really popular food in matsuri, and we can see okonomiyaki. Yeah, it&#39;s, somepeople say Japanese pancake, or something, but tastes different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not sweet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not sweet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not sweet. So vegetables, meat, and some sauce.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow!
  <span class="audiodef">
   Sounds good
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
