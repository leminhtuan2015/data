  Hi! my name&#39;s Theodore and I&#39;d like to talk to you a little about photography. When I
  <span class="audiodef">
   first started
  </span>
  studying photography I
  <span class="audiodef">
   bought myself
  </span>
  a fairly good
  <span class="audiodef">
   film camera
  </span>
  but since then
  <span class="audiodef">
   digital cameras
  </span>
  have been getting better and cheaper and recently I bought a somewhat expensive digital camera which I think can do just about as well as most film cameras for most things.
 </p>
 <p>
  I&#39;m
  <span class="audiodef">
   particularly into
  </span>
  <span class="audiodef">
   photo-journalism
  </span>
  so digital is fast and it gives me all I need for photo-journalism. And some people say that it&#39;s starting to get better quality than films, so I think digital is the
  <span class="audiodef">
   way forward
  </span>
  in the future.
