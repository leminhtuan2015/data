    Joel:
   </strong>
   So, Mitchell, I only surfed for about a year and I never got very good at it. I wonder if you could explain how a beginner goes about learning how to surf.

   </strong>
   Well,
   <span class="audionotes">
    that&#39;s a tough question
   </span>
   because I was surfing ever since I was small so it
   <span class="audionotes">
    came natural to me
   </span>
   , surfing, but since I know I surf. The beginning is put your board in the sand, lay on your board on the sand, pretend that you are
   <span class="audionotes">
    paddling
   </span>
   and then push yourself up like a push-up and then stand. You repeat that over-and-over again and eventually you enter the water and you get a friend to hold the board for you and then you stand up in the water while your friend pushed the board to gain balance.

    Joel:
   </strong>
   The part I had the hardest time with was when there were big waves, it was so hard to
   <span class="audionotes">
    get out far enough
   </span>
   so that you could actually catch a wave. What do you call it, &#34;duck diving&#34;?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Duck diving, yeah, it&#39;s key to surfing. If you see a wave, the thing is that you have to see the wave before it comes. That&#39;s the secret, like where&#39;s it crashing and when it&#39;s crashing. We call it &#34;crashing&#34; when it&#39;s coming down. Duck diving, you put your knees on the board if it&#39;s a big wave...
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Oh, you get on your knees.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   You get on your hands and knees and you push the nose of the board down
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   OK, push the front part down.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Yeah, and at the same time, after you push it down, you also kick your hips, and push with your hips, like how you dive in water, like a dolphin.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   OK, and then when the wave crashes over you, do you lay down on the board.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   You get back up. You pull your nose back up.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   OK, you pull the front and back, back up, and that helps you to back under the wave. And what about when you&#39;re...
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   But the key is, you don&#39;t want to duck dive when the wave is crashing on you because you are already screwed.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   OK, you have to duck before the wave.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Before the wave or when it&#39;s crashing on you, like we call it white water. A lot of times you duck dive in white water. White water is when the wave crashes. The water looks like it&#39;s all white like white cotton candy, so you duck dive underneath that.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   And when you&#39;re catching a wave, how do you know when to stand up?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Like when the wave, when you see the wave coming you start paddling to get with the wave and before the wave even starts
   <span class="audionotes">
    curling
   </span>
   , you&#39;re already getting ready to stand up. It the wave is already curling, and your standing up, it&#39;s too late.

   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   It&#39;s too late. OK. So you have to stand up...

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Before it starts curling.

   I see. I see.

    Mitchell:

   And going the direction where it&#39;s crashing.

    Joel:

   Well, I&#39;m going to have to go surfing with you sometime so I can have a private lesson.
