  Todd:
 </strong>
 Jeff, you mentioned to me that you went across the Amazon in Brazil.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Yes. Yes. I was going to South America and when I do a trip I don&#39;t like to be a regular tourist and just go and sightsee, so I got an idea from a National Geographic magazine to go straight across South America from the Pacific Ocean in Peru, starting in Peru, across to the Atlantic Ocean on the opposite side in Brazil and you have to go through the Andes Mountains and then you have to go across and through the Amazon, so that&#39;s what I did.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s fantastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  It was a good trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How did you go? Did you travel alone? I mean
  <span class="audionotes">
   it must have been dangerous
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  It was. It was dangerous. It was high season,
  <span class="audionotes">
   monsoon season
  </span>
  , so the river was high, and of course they speak Spanish in South America and I can&#39;t speak Spanish and I was traveling alone and I didn&#39;t want to travel alone. It&#39;s too dangerous, so I had to look for another travel partner who was a little bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   as crazy as I was
  </span>
  to do this trip, so when I arrived in Lima, the capitol of Peru, I started looking around for someone else who looked like a tough, good traveller, and one night in my guesthouse, this bald Russian guy came into the guesthouse carrying a big pack, and he had a big pack with a tent, a sleeping bag strapped to it and he had a big machete hanging off his belt, and I said
  <span class="audionotes">
   this guys perfect
  </span>
  , so went up and talked to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  He sounds a little bit like Indiana Jones.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Oh, he was great. He was a great guy, and his wife is Mexican so he spoke perfect Spanish, so I told him my idea and he was
  <span class="audionotes">
   gung ho
  </span>
  . He was ready to do it.
