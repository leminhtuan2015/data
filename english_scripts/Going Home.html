   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Victor, tomorrow you&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   flying home
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s correct.
 </p>
 <p>

   </a>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So, are you afraid of flying?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  No, flying&#39;s fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
  <span class="audionotes">
   Back home
  </span>
  for your job, do you fly?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  No, I drive to work and to different assignments.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. You never have to fly to go to conventions or other cities or stuff like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  Once or twice each year I do fly to go to conventions connected with my work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Tomorrow you have a really long flight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s probably what about 15 hours?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  From Narita to Washington DC is 12 hours in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. So how do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   pass the time
  </span>
  on the plane?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  On the plane, I like to sleep
  <span class="audionotes">
   as much as possible
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Do you take medication or just have a beer or..?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  No. I don&#39;t take any medication. I just.. I tend to stay up late the day before so that I&#39;m so tired I will want to sleep on the plane.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, good
  <span class="audionotes">
   strategy
  </span>
  and I hope you have a good flight.
 </p>
 <p>

 Hello, Gabrielle!
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Hello!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How are you doing today?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Good thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Gabrielle, I hear that you are going back home to New Zealand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. I&#39;m going home for summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What are your plans?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Probably a week relaxing, going camping and then I&#39;m going back to work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Where do you work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  I teach as an English teacher in Christchurch in New Zealand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. And that&#39;s where you&#39;re from, naturally.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Were you born there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  I was, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, you are going to have this
  <span class="audionotes">
   short little break
  </span>
  or vacation, are you
                                          going go to the beach or the mountains?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Probably, to the beach and camping for about a week with friends. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, how
  <span class="audiodef">
   warm
  </span>
  is it in the summer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Probably, a maximum of about 30 degrees. A nice dry heat. Very comfortable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So when you go to the beach is the water
  <span class="audionotes">
   warm enough
  </span>
  to swim in?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  No, no! We swim but it is not warm. Yeah! It&#39;s pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   chilly
  </span>
  actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Any other plans when you go home?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   looking forward
  </span>
  to
  <span class="audionotes">
   catching up
  </span>
  with friends and family and animals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Animals?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Well, I
  <span class="audionotes">
   miss
  </span>
  <span class="audiodef">
   my pets
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Well, what pets do you have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  I have a cat, a dog, a sheep called Sydney and two gold fish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Yeah! And I really miss them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sure they&#39;re really excited to see you. Alright, thanks a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Cheers!

   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Hi, Doris. You look a little bit down. What&#39;s the matter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doris:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m leaving Japan and I&#39;m going back to London, tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doris:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  How do you feel about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doris:
  </strong>
  Well, I do feel a bit down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months, in Japan. I am going to miss it so much, cause I&#39;ve had a great time here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Mm, so what are you going to miss about Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doris:
  </strong>
  Oh, I am going to miss the people, the food, the night life. Especially the nightlife.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  What especially about the night life are you going to miss?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doris:
  </strong>
  Well, I really like dancing. And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I&#39;m really going to miss that because it&#39;s very different to London.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  How are the clubs different in Japan than in London?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doris:
  </strong>
  Well, here there are many different clubs you can get into, for free, you don&#39;t have to pay, some of them. In London it&#39;s really expensive for drinks and an entry fee.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Always?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doris:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Ah, that is different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doris:
  </strong>
  But they do have the same pubs, but if you wanted to go to a nightclub for example it would cost quite a lot of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  And how do the prices of food and drinks compare?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doris:
  </strong>
  Ah, well, I&#39;d say in Japan drinks are cheaper than in London.

  <strong>
   Jeremy
  </strong>
  : So Abedimi, you grew up really with two homes. Can you tell us a little bit about what it’s like having two homes? Do you feel any particular loyalty more to one than the other or are they both home for you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That’s a good question. I think for me, both places are home. I grew up in Nigeria and in Canada. My extended family, he’s in Nigeria. So when I go there, I instantly feel at home, like, they
  <span class="audionotes">
   welcome me with open arms
  </span>
  . It’s the food, the music, the people, the smell. It’s amazing. It’s like I almost never left, except when I open my mouth and speak in English and it&#39;s a completely different accent. That’s a different story.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then I go to Canada, and I think my way of thinking, my mentality, is more oriented toward that way. Like, I think more like a Canadian, I find in a lot of situations. So that is home, too. A lot of my friends are in Canada. My parents are in Canada.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, I don’t know. I don’t really feel a conflict of interest most of the time. So I think I’m just kind of enjoying having two places where I
  <span class="audionotes">
   fit in
  </span>
  more or less.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeremy
  </strong>
  : So it is possible for a person to have two homes then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : And even more. I think it is possible, yeah. And it&#39;s great. It’s awesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeremy
  </strong>
  : So you’ve been away from Canada for a while now. When you go back there, do you find it difficult or easy to reintegrate into your city, into your family’s house, or does it take a little bit of time to
  <span class="audionotes">
   readjust
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : It does take a couple of days or three, because where I live now is different. So sometimes, when I go home, just the language, hearing English everywhere and being able to understand what everyone is saying. Sometimes it’s overwhelming. I’m just like, “Whoa, whoa, which conversation do I listen to? Do I
  <span class="audionotes">
   eavesdrop
  </span>
  --eavesdropping on?” So there is that aspect.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is also the fact that some of my friends, our relationship is not as close as it used to be. So you go back home and you’re talking about—I talk about my new life and they don’t really understand all that I’m going through. And they are
  <span class="audionotes">
   moving on with their lives
  </span>
  as well. So that aspect is different—and missing my parents as well. But it always feels really good when I go back and see them, and spend that time with them, yeah, to reconnect. And eating all the food that I’ve missed being away from home, that’s always awesome. I always try to make list to make sure I cover everything I want to eat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeremy
  </strong>
  : Is there anything in particular that you look forward to eating when you go back home, the first thing that you immediately
  <span class="audionotes">
   make a beeline for
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Oh! I love food, so it’s hard to choose one. I just want to eat everything. I mean, there is pizza—the local pizza shop near my house where my—oh my gosh, I got to have pizza there. There’s Tim Hortons, Timmy’s, the hot chocolate, the muffins. Love that. There’s my local restaurant—I don’t know—my mom’s cooking. So it’s hard to pick just one thing. I really look forward to going home and the food, so yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeremy
  </strong>
  : Yeah. As a fellow Canadian, I know what you mean, especially with Tim Hortons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Oh, thank you.
 </p>
