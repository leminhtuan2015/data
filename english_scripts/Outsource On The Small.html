  Julia:
 </strong>
 So Todd, we were talking about outsourcing and how you use these kind of services when you do your website.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uh-uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  What kind of careers do people follow?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know, you can do anything. It&#39;s amazing. If you go to oDesk or if you go to Freelancer, anything. I mean they have accounting services, legal services, people that do writing, proof reading, photo editing, video production,
  <span class="audionotes">
   voice actors
  </span>
  , there&#39;s so many jobs that you can buy online or people you can hire online.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. And I think it&#39;s really cool if you want another career or if you want to travel the world, you know it&#39;s an easy way to work from anywhere in the world. So a lot of jobs where you just work from a computer, you know you can do it anywhere. You can go live in Vietnam or you can go live in Argentina and you can do your work there if you can get the work together. So I think it&#39;s a great opportunity for a lot of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it sounds so flexible and yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   brilliant
  </span>
  . My mother is a tailor, she&#39;s a qualified
  <span class="audionotes">
   tailor
  </span>
  , could she do that? Could she outsource or does it have to be an online service?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think it pretty much has to be any white collar job. It has to be basically something that you would do with a computer. You know you might be able to, like you might be able to get a contract and then maybe
  <span class="audionotes">
   ship
  </span>
  people the work or whatever. I think if you were going to do that, what you would want to do is you probably can get stuff by using Google, Google AdSense, you know, or AdWords, I can&#39;t remember which is which, but you can place ads let&#39;s say in Google so you can drum up business anywhere in the world. So like for example if your mom wanted to go live in Cuba what she could do is place ads, Google ads, and maybe she can get tailoring work and do it from Cuba and then maybe send, you know, send the products to people around the world via shipping. So, yeah, I guess you could. So how about you? Would you be into that? Would you be interested in having a digital life and just living anywhere in the world?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m a yoga instructor so my work involves being generally in the same room. I guess you could do something online with it but I like, I&#39;m a people person, I like to
  <span class="audionotes">
   interact
  </span>
  with people so I think I&#39;d find it quite
  <span class="audionotes">
   lonely
  </span>
  working. I appreciate that it would be good for traveling, like if you wanted to go live somewhere really exotic and not do a nine-to-five job, I could imagine it for short term maybe but I like working with people
  <span class="audionotes">
   face-to-face
  </span>
  so I&#39;d find it a bit lonely I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I know what you mean. I know what you mean.
