   Todd
  </strong>
  : Hey, Natalie, I like your outfit. It looks really cute.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, hey Todd. Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So, that shirt looks expensive. Did it cost a lot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, this one? Yeah. It was about $50.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : $50? That&#39;s a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I know. It&#39;s an American brand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ah. Do they have that shirt in different colors?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yes, so I actually have this top in six colors.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Really? What colors?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I have it in purple, blue, red, gray, white, and black. Actually, I have two black ones, so that&#39;s seven.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You have two shirts in black? Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Well, black is such a good color to wear. It matches everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So true, so true. What about your pants? Those pants are pretty cool too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, these? Yeah. These were much cheaper than the tops. I bought these in San Francisco. They cost about $40.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ooh. Those are cheap. That&#39;s a good price.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : It is, and I only have one pair of these.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And your shoes? Did you buy those shoes in San Francisco too?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : No, I didn&#39;t buy these in San Francisco. These, I bought online.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You bought them online?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yes. These sandals are really hard to find, so I had to buy them through Amazon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, I like Amazon. I buy lots of things on Amazon. For example, I bought this watch on Amazon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : How much did it cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, this watch was really cheap. This watch only cost about $20.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Whoa.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, but I have two watches, and I also bought a nice, gold watch on Amazon. That watch was very expensive. It cost $200.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Whoa, $200 on a watch? I think my watch only cost maybe $70, but I really like this watch. It&#39;s an Apple Watch. I bought it in Malaysia. I&#39;ve had it for about two years now, but I think now that I have an Apple Watch, I&#39;ll always have Apple Watches.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that is a nice watch. I want an Apple Watch too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, they&#39;re so cool. I spend so much time on my phone, and the watch works really well with my phone. I definitely recommend it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I like this cheap watch, because if it rains, or if I play sports, or if I am traveling, I can take my cheap watch, because this watch is not important. I can break it. I can lose it. I can do anything. But my gold watch, that watch is expensive, so I keep it at home. I only wear it on nice occasions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, well it&#39;s nice to have something a little more expensive, but my watch can tell me what the weather&#39;s like, my watch can tell me how many calories I&#39;ve burned, and my watch can tell me what the time is anywhere in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You know, I think I need to get a watch like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie:
  </strong>
  This is the greatest watch.
