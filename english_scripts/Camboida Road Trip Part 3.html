   Todd
  </strong>
  : So what was the hardest thing about the trip?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : The hardest thing was seeing this country which is so beautiful with such amazing people but
  <span class="audionotes">
   struggling
  </span>
  in so many different ways with so many different things. You know, historically the legacy of Pol Pot on the country and this huge discrepancy between the rich and the poor. So as we&#39;re cycling along these unpaved roads beside farmers on carts that are being pulled by water buffalo, there&#39;s these huge four by fours screaming through not paying any attention to anybody. There&#39;s no law, there&#39;s no road law, so they could drive whatever speeds they wanted, tearing up the earth, causing accidents. I witnessed an accident and that was particularly hard to deal with. The car that caused the accident didn&#39;t stop and the guy that was
  <span class="audionotes">
   left in the dust
  </span>
  didn&#39;t have much chance. You know the locals I guess tried to get him to a hospital or whatever but the medical conditions, there&#39;s not much going on in terms of rural hospitals. People are still dying from poor sanitation, water, malaria, these kind of things that we should be able to
  <span class="audionotes">
   eradicate
  </span>
  , you know, instantly. We have the knowledge and the know how to do but still struggling with that. And, you know, being aware that education is so important and that people aren&#39;t getting it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. What was the best thing about the journey?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : The best thing about the journey was going to this place that was so, that seemed so exotic and getting to see, you know, how people lived there and how they smile at everybody. You know, everybody in Cambodia was so friendly and so peaceful and so, I don&#39;t know, welcoming. It made me realize like how privileged I really am in life and things that I
  <span class="audionotes">
   take for granted
  </span>
  . You know my education and the choices I have and things like that. And the beauty and mystery of Angkor Wat is, I mean it&#39;s an incredibly, it&#39;s one of the world&#39;s, it&#39;s one of the seven wonders of the world I think these temples, these incredible
  <span class="audionotes">
   temples
  </span>
  , getting to go there and we took some of the kids from the school there. These kids who live in the area who never actually ever been there. We went on a school trip with them and took them and they got to go through, going through these temples and the jungle with these young kids and it was really awesome.

  : That&#39;s a great experience.
 </p>
