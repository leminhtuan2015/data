   Todd:
  </strong>
  Marika lets talk about television.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you like to
  <span class="audiodef">
   watch a lot of TV
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I watch a lot of TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now you&#39;ve been in Japan for awhile. Do yo watch TV in English or in Japanese?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  I watch TV in Japanese, but if it&#39;s on in English I will watch it in English. Yeah, I&#39;m the
  <span class="audiodef">
   same way
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : How good is your comprehension? How much can you understand?
 </p>
 <p>
  If it&#39;s a drama I can understand most of what&#39;s happening, and definitely the story, but if a talk show and there&#39;s young people on and there&#39;re speaking fast, with a lot of
  <span class="audiodef">
   slang
  </span>
  , I don&#39;t really understand a lot of what they&#39;re saying, although I might know what topic they&#39;re discussing, I won&#39;t know what exactly their stand is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you think that TV is bad for people?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think that TV is bad for people. It&#39;s really bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  Because instead of reading a book or doing something outside, or doing something
  <span class="audiodef">
   productive
  </span>
  you just sit in front of a TV and
  <span class="audiodef">
   absorb
  </span>
  bad information or things that don&#39;t really help, help you learn anything probably, although Japanese television I think does have a lot of good documentaries and a lot of informative television programs.
