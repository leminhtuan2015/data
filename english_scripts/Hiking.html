   Todd:
  </strong>
  Every year my company gives me three weeks holiday, in summer, in August, and usually I go home and I see my family, but two years ago, before I went home, I took a hiking trip in Japan and I went hiking across the &#34;Minami Alps&#34;, uh, &#34;Minami&#34; means &#34;south&#34; so they&#39;re the Southern Alps in Japan. It was a really good hike. The hike took me five days. Before I went on the hike I needed to buy some gear so I bought a tent, a backpack, some hiking boots, and a good map of the area I was going to traverse. When I did the hike it was really, really hard. I was not prepared for how difficult it was going to be. Each day I had to hike about 12 hours, and the hardest part about each hike was having to carry lots and lots of water because you&#39;re walking all day, you have to drink lots of water or else you&#39;ll get dehydrated. The mountains were really steep, but once I got over the first mountain, it was just beautiful, really, really beautiful, and I met lots of really nice hikers, especially elderly hikers on the trail and I just had a great time. I just remember the beautiful views from the peaks and at night I could see the stars really clearly, probably more clearly than I ever had before. I was a really really good trip.

   </strong>
   So, Steven, what do you like to do in your free time?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Um, free time. Well, I would just love to have some free time, occasionally I have some free time and well, I love to go hiking. Ah, I live in Japan in Kyuushuu and there are some beautiful mountains quite nearby to where I live so sometimes I go, I go hiking in the mountains.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Well, actually, I love hiking and I am new to Kyuushuu (Right) I just moved here, so can you tell me where I should go hiking. What are the best spots?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Right, well, there&#39;s one range of mountains in Kuju. One of the mountains is called Nakadake, which means central peak, I believe, and that is actually the highest, the highest peak, the highest mountain on mainland Kyuushuu. There is one higher mountain on an island near Kagoshima but on mainland Kyuushuu that&#39;s the highest peak and it&#39;s quite a challenge and there are some beautiful views from that mountain.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Wow! Is it a day hike? Can I hike it in one day?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Oh, sure. It takes about three hours to go up and the descent takes about two hours.
   <br>
   It takes about two hours to come back down.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, that&#39;s great well, we live on Beppu and Beppu is on the coast. It&#39;s on the ocean, so how can
   <br>
   I get to the mountain. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have a car, so can I take the train or a bus?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Um, I&#39;m not absolutely sure. I&#39;ve only ever been by car myself. Um, I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a train that
   <br>
   stops by the mountain but you can certainly get closer than you are now by train, and then you can perhaps
   <br>
   take a bus or even a taxi from a town closer by. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m sorry.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, that&#39;s OK. Well, you know, I&#39;ve never done it before, but I hear that it&#39;s safe
   <br>
   to hitchhike in Japan. Is that true?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Oh, absolutely. Yep. Yep. The crime rate in Japan is so low. You&#39;d have to be incredibly
   <br>
   unlucky to have any problems hitchhiking
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   And will people stop and pick me up?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Ah, that I don&#39;t know.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Maybe I&#39;ll have to give it a try. OK, thanks a lot.
