   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Eli, how are your Japanese classes going?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  They&#39;re going OK. Japanese is a very difficult language and I think as someone who has never learned another language before I&#39;m struggling more than other kids are. I feel that a lot of theother, say European kids, that this is there third or fourth language, that they can speak fluently, they pick it up very quickly, and for me it&#39;s slightly more difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I say, our school is quite advanced and it moves very, very quickly in conversation. We&#39;re not learning any Kanji, which is kind of difficult cause that&#39;s one thing you really do need to learn if you&#39;re living here, but the conversation moves very quickly and we learn a lot of new stuff, so it&#39;s quite difficult to practice it all. I think that&#39;s the problem I&#39;m finding, and a lot of my friends say the same thing: they&#39;re learning it all but then they don&#39;t have time to practice. It&#39;s actually crazy to think, you&#39;re in Japan but it&#39;s quite difficult to actually practice the Japanese language.
 </p>
 <p>
  You see all my Japanese friends they want to practice English with me, so, you actually end up being very lazy, and not talking that much Japanese, so I think that is the problem, just you have to have conversation thru conversation all the time and I&#39;m not really doing that at the moment, so yeah, it&#39;s difficult. I think I&#39;ll get there. I&#39;m just about starting to understand stuff now.
