    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   So, Mary, my battery has almost ran out. I&#39;m so glad you had some but they&#39;re cold.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Well, I keep them in my frigerator along with several other sizes of batteries just so I have them on hand. It&#39;s a little
   <span class="audionotes">
    quirky
   </span>
   habit of mine but I always like to have backup whenever I need it so I&#39;ve got into the habit of
   <span class="audionotes">
    stockpiling
   </span>
   batteries and keeping them in the fridge.
  </font>

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   Well, it&#39;s very practical but why do you keep them in the frigerator?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   I read somewhere a long time ago that that&#39;s how you
   <span class="audionotes">
    extend the life
   </span>
   of batteries by keeping them cool, that and film too so I also have several canisters of film in there, too, no room for the butter but.

   Do you have any food in your frigerator?

   Some but it&#39;s mostly batteries and film.

   What kind of food do you keep in your frigerator?

    Mary:
   </strong>
   Right now because it&#39;s winter time, I have some oranges and actually some grapes and things so those are kind of coveted at this time of year, otherwise just the standard things. I have yogurt, milk, and some bread and I think six brusselsprouts.
  </font>

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>

   Just six.

   Why do you have brusselsprouts?

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Just got in the habit of eating them. They&#39;re really very good, so I thought well I&#39;ll keep on, just handfuls so they don&#39;t spoil.
  </font>

   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   How so you prepare your brusselsprouts?

 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Um, I steam them for about 10 minutes or so and eat them just perfectly
   <span class="audionotes">
    plain
   </span>
   , a little salt and a little pepper, that&#39;s about it.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   Really, I find them a little bitter.
  </font>

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   I find them a little bitter too, but the longer you steam them the bitterness kind of goes away and of course there&#39;s ways you can
   <span class="audionotes">
    dissipate
   </span>
   the bitterness with a little bit of butter or salt or seasonings too, so they&#39;re not so bad.
  </font>

   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   Well, I&#39;ll have to try that.
