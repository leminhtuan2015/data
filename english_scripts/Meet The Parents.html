   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Let&#39;s see. My mom is three years older than my dad. They are
  <span class="audionotes">
   like night and day
  </span>
  . My mom is 5 foot 4 on a good day, 5 foot 2 I think in real life. She is very
  <br>
  sweet, very nice, very caring and very cute.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Everybody tells her how young she looks and how she
  <span class="audionotes">
   resembles
  </span>
  my sister, perhaps. My father is very much completely opposite that. He is a very big man, very loud, very funny, very boisterous.
 </p>
 <p>
  He
  <span class="audionotes">
   makes friends
  </span>
  no matter where he goes. For example, sometimes he goes to Florida and makes all sorts of new friends. He&#39;ll just go by himself. He&#39;s a kind of a magnet to people. So my parents are completely opposite and they
  <span class="audionotes">
   complement each other
  </span>
  very well. My dad has a very good
  <span class="audionotes">
   sense of humor
  </span>
  . My mom is very gentle. Very nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  When was the last time you talked to you parents?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I talked to them probably about two weeks ago. Yeah, everything is going well with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Are you going to see them soon?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I am going to go home after the holidays and we&#39;re going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February. Yeah, depending on when my brother can come in.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Who are you more like, your mother or your father?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I think I have traits of both, actually. I look more like my mother, except that I am about a foot taller. Yeah, I resemble my mom more. I think I have both of the characteristics of my mom and dad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Great. Thanks.
