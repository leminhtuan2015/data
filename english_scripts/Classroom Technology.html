  Everyone talks about how kids these days use technology much more than in the past, but when I think back to my childhood, I remember how technology was a huge part of my life. The first thing is the cassette tape, especially when I was in high school, every Friday night my favorite radio station used to play complete records, and I would stay up till about ten o&#39;clock in the evening and have my cassette recorder ready and I would record the entire
  <span class="audionotes">
   album
  </span>
  , the entire record from the radio and then I would be able to play it in my car.

  I was born in 1971, so when I was a kid, people weren&#39;t using the internet but I had a computer in my house when I about 11 or 12 years old and my dad taught me some basic programming and I even created a program where I
  <span class="audionotes">
   fooled
  </span>
  one of my friends into thinking that we had entered into the computer
  <span class="audionotes">
   record system
  </span>
  at my school and he was getting a bad
  <span class="audionotes">
   grade
  </span>
  in social studies and I made it look like we had entered into the social studies records file and I changed his grade and he was very scared about this. He went home and told his dad and finally
  <span class="audionotes">
   called me back
  </span>
  later on that evening and said, &#34;Hey, my dad said that you need a modem to break into another computer.&#34;
