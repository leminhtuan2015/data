   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  So, Gareth, what&#39;s your daily routine like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  My routine is actually a little
  <span class="audionotes">
   irregular
  </span>
  . I have a different working schedule for each day of the week, but on a weekend my son usually wakes me up about half-eight, nine o&#39;clock, and after that we go downstairs, and I get him some cereal, like he likes at the moment chocolate rice Krispies and he has a bowl of them and we watch Toy Story. He loves Buzz and Woody.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Every weekend the same movie?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Exactly. Again and again and again. Yeah, so we watch it a lot. On weekdays, though, I usually wake up at six a.m. I have to go to work at eight, so I commute on the bus and train and that takes an hour and a half. It takes a long time, and then I work. I get home about
  <span class="audionotes">
   sevenish
  </span>
  . I have dinner with my wife. Usually if I come home late, she waits and she&#39;ll have dinner with me, and sometimes she&#39;ll wait until like nine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Whoa!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Yeah, pretty late, so it&#39;s really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Are you a morning shower person or a nighttime bath, relax person?

 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so actually I think I&#39;m a kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   night owl
  </span>
  . I work much better in the evening and I get more done. In the morning I&#39;m a little bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   like a zombie
  </span>
  , but these last years, working have kind of trained me to be an early bird. Waking up so early, as I do, I&#39;ve kind of adapted to it, so. But I much prefer the evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  So you would come home from work and eat dinner and then take like the bath to calm down to go to bed at night?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  No, actually I prefer showers than baths, but yeah, I usually relax with my family and watch a movie or read a book. My son&#39;s really into Dr. Zeuss books. They&#39;re classic children&#39;s books from back home and they&#39;re great. Even for me, like that&#39;s the good thing about having kids, you kind of get reattached to your, and feel kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   nostalgic
  </span>
  about your old activities like the things that you did when you were a child.
