  Alex
 </strong>
 : So Maria, what are your future plans?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Future plans, that&#39;s a big question. I would like to have an nice career. I&#39;m not really sure what it would be. I would love to be a CEO of some place, some place big but I don&#39;t need to. I just want to have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   prestigious
  </span>
  job because I&#39;m that kind of person and I want to have a nice pay and I want, I think it&#39;s more important to me to have, it keep on being interesting. I&#39;m very afraid of just ending up with a job that just
  <span class="audionotes">
   bores me to death
  </span>
  or something. I do want a family. I hope I&#39;m about to find the guy I will have a family with in the next couple of years because otherwise I&#39;ll have to start looking and I&#39;d rather have the love at first sight thing or just like having it be normal instead of just having to look for it like those
  <span class="audionotes">
   desperate
  </span>
  women you see in the TV. Have a nice house maybe in Denmark I&#39;m not sure. I love big cities and Copenhagen is awesome but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s big enough for me. I might go to Tokyo, a place I studied Japanese and I might go to or I might go to another European country. I have something with Holland. I keep getting friends from Holland or connections and I get attracted to Dutch people for some reason so Amsterdam is a choice. My parents wouldn&#39;t mind me going to Amsterdam. They want me close. I just, I don&#39;t know, I would like my future to be kind of unclear.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Because I have friends who&#39;ve known they wouldn&#39;t want to be a doctor or a nurse or a teacher since they were five and that&#39;s just I need to be able to change whenever I can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Do you think you would change your career if you felt that it got too boring or...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t think I know I will change. I will just say phew.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : So you&#39;d want to be able to fit your work to your life as opposed to the other way around?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : I might be a little
  <span class="audionotes">
   self-centered
  </span>
  because I have to be satisfied. I can&#39;t just, I have had jobs like part time jobs or very short time jobs just because I had time and I get impatient very fast if it&#39;s not, if it doesn&#39;t work for me I just hate getting up in the morning and if it&#39;s going to be my life. Studying and having a part time job you can live with it. You can live with a bad job but having to do it every day, having to do a bad job every day just like it seems
  <span class="audionotes">
   pointless
  </span>
  to me.
