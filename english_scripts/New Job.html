   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So, Trina I understand you got a new job recently. What are you doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  I am a flight attendant for a
  <span class="audionotes">
   charter
  </span>
  airline, World Airways, out of the United States, and we do mostly military charters into military air force bases and we do some other American football teams and some oil
  <span class="audionotes">
   tycoons
  </span>
  into Africa.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Ooh, that sounds like an interesting job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  It is. It&#39;s very interesting. I get to travel all over the world to some destinations that people normally would not travel to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Like what?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  Like Osan Korea, which would not actually be a city if it were not for our American military being in the city. I&#39;ve also been to Kuwait, and Frankfurt, and Tachikawa, Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I see so it&#39;s kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   a mix
  </span>
  of some big cities and then some smaller cities that you visit. What&#39;s your favorite city so far?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  So far, I&#39;d have to say that Tokyo is my favorite city. Lots of stuff to do. My sister lives there. Lots of shopping. Very fun, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   super
  </span>
  cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s because of the time of year. Wait till you come in the summer. It gets really hot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trina:
  </strong>
  I
  <span class="audionotes">
   can&#39;t wait
  </span>
  .
