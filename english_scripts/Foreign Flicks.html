   Goron
  </b>
  : When I want to look something like more original, I started to watch some Korean movies or Indian movies from Bollywood, which are really interesting. I was fairly surprised. Try it guys because Korean movies are great. Are great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : Korean movies are good but the ones – the typical thing about Korean movies, they always end bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Win
  </b>
  : They always end with cancer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : Whereas Hollywood movies, usually there&#39;s always like it has a good ending.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : And actually, Japanese movies do the same thing. The happy ending is not so
  <span class="audionotes">
   granted
  </span>
  . And probably many people like them for this reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : And I would say that even Norwegian movies, they try to, you know, go out from the norm that movies are supposed to end nicely. And that they have like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   shocking ending
  </span>
  . It&#39;s like reading a novel with a shocking ending that you wouldn&#39;t expect to happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : Because I think some love movies really have a bad effect on the real life because people are trying to have the same relationship that they see on the movies. And then when it&#39;s not like – love is not like that. It&#39;s not that beautiful. It&#39;s not like
  <span class="audionotes">
   happy ending
  </span>
  all the time. And so they…
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : Oh but…
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Win
  </b>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : And then – and they are shocked when their real life – they see that they…
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : But not all movies are like that. I mean, even animation movies like you&#39;ve seen Up, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : Well, the plot is like they fall in love, they have like a nice time, and then the problematic moment. You know, they
  <span class="audionotes">
   overcome
  </span>
  like the difficulties, and then at the end, they live all together. Happy ending.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Win
  </b>
  : Well, that&#39;s the usual Western
  <span class="audionotes">
   discourse
  </span>
  of how you produce a movie. But I think nowadays, movie producers are trying to do a lot of different things from the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : Yeah, they try but basically…
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : It&#39;s interesting to say because maybe why we prefer movies to have good endings and why we prefer them to be very harmonic is because maybe we don&#39;t want to watch depressing things. We want the movie to give us a good feeling in the aftermath.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : To give us hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : Yeah, give us hope, give us like good thoughts. And you know when I watched Up for instance, which is an animation. When I just saw the first part of the movie, it really – I almost cried just watching it. I never cry to an animation film like that before. It was really, really
  <span class="audionotes">
   touching
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : Right. I cried to the Lion King. [Laughs]
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : When I was younger, I cried to the Lion King.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : No, I still cry when I see that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Win
  </b>
  : I mean it&#39;s good to be emotional.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : Oh yeah. When the movie is good, it&#39;s good forever.
