   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Mark you said that you want to own your own home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  That would be nice, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Todd: So let&#39;s say you can have any home in the world. You can make your dream home, reasonable dream home. OK, what kind of house would you have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Well, I don&#39;t normally dream of like an enormous mansion, or anything. Just a nice, you know, medium to large size home. I guess almost more importantly for me is to have some land with the house, like I don&#39;t like, I wouldn&#39;t want my neighbor to be, you know, just three feet away from my house. I&#39;d like to have a little bit of space.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK, so assuming you have a big yard and you have this space, you have land, what kind of landscape would you have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Well, I grew up in Alabama and I really like the landscape there. It&#39;s kind of hilly and lots of trees and lots of pine trees, you know, itâ€™s a deciduous area of America, and lots of lakes so I guess, you know, that kind of setting, like a deciduous you know, lots of trees, lots of lakes, you know, or some water nearby and hills: things like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK, but actually, what would you want your yard to look like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Oh, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You don&#39;t want a lake, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : No, no, but, yeah, I don&#39;t know, I would want it to be taken care of, but not overly manicured, like I don&#39;t want it to be, you know, too much pruning, just, but I wouldn&#39;t want it to be completely wild either, so green but not like a just completely perfect square, or anything. I&#39;d like for it to be a little bit, chaotic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK, so what do you want: a big bathroom, small bathroom, big kitchen, small kitchen?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Big bathrooms, big kitchen. Yeah. The bigger, the better!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : The bigger, the better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Two car garage?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Sure. That&#39;ll be fine. And actually the way the house is decorated, you know, if I&#39;m married, my wife can decorate most of the house but I&#39;d like to have one room that was my room, like that, you know, maybe I could put a small library and lots of books, maybe a pool table but one room that I got to do, you know, my own thing with.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, man. You need your territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Yeah, just that one room.
