  Katia:
 </strong>
 Hello Felipe, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Hello, Katherine, I&#39;m fine, you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Good. Actually I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   starving
  </span>
  and I wanted to ask you about food. What is your favorite Colombian food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well, in Colombia we have many, many different kinds of food but something that I would recommend you to eat is the bandeja. Bandeja paisa is a traditional Colombian food and it&#39;s made out of meat, fried meat, potatoes. You would also have salad, rice, corn and some sausages. That&#39;s really, really delicious. That&#39;s something I recommend you to try.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Bandeja. I have heard of it. What about something else? Maybe do you have soups in Colombia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you&#39;re right. We have many different kinds of soups in Colombia because in Colombia there are many different kinds of potatoes and corn. So, for example, if you travel to the center, the
  <span class="audionotes">
   central
  </span>
  part of Colombia, if you travel to the capital Bogot·, you will find a soup called ajijaco. Ajijaco is composed of potatoes, corn, some cream and also some meat. You know, it&#39;s quite delicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  It sounds delicious. Now you said that there are many different types of potatoes. What do you mean different types of potatoes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what I mean is that there are different size of potatoes. You have big potatoes, you have small potatoes and they taste different also. You have sweet ones, you have sour ones and you have many different kind of taste.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  It really sounds delicious. What about drinks? What would you recommend as a Colombian drink?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well, if you go to Colombia you should try Colombian juices because we have different kinds of fruits in the
  <span class="audionotes">
   Amazon region
  </span>
  , in the highlands and in the
  <span class="audionotes">
   coastal region
  </span>
  . So, for example, there is a fruit called guanabana. Now guanabana is a delicious fruit and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s something like that fruit somewhere else in the world so you have to try. Its taste is different, it&#39;s delicious. It&#39;s a traditional Colombian fruit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Hmm, guan·bana. Definitely I&#39;m going to try. Thank you Felipe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  OK, you&#39;re welcome.
