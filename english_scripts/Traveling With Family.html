  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Jeyong, you were telling me that you like to travel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  Yes, very much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, this is interesting. Who do you normally travel with?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  You would be kind of surprised to hear this, but then, I normally travel with my dad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. That&#39;s so cool. Why is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  That will be
  <span class="audionotes">
   first of all
  </span>
  because my dad goes on a business trip very often and I ask him if I can follow him most of the time and he would say yes, and I would just have time with him on his business trip and traveling around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s really cool. What kind of business does your father do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s in
  <span class="audionotes">
   apparel
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Apparel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  Export
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So does he teach you the secrets about business?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  Not that much about business, but then traveling around he teaches me about differences between all the cultures of countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s fantastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  How importat that is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what countries have you been to with your father?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong
  </strong>
  : A lot to name, actually. Do you want me to name all those?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, how about which ones do you remember the most?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  I remember the most about Europe. I went to France, England, Switzerland and Roma so those four places were very interesting for me, and other than that, I went to Cambodia, Vietnam, Guam, and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What was Cambodia like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  Cambodia is a really
  <span class="audionotes">
   memorable trip
  </span>
  for me with my dad because it was really interesting how many people in boats on the water. There&#39;s a society in Cambodia like that and then it was really sad looking at them how they own much money and they have to spend their day using a dollar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So not very much, but did the people seem happy in Cambodia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  They did look happy, happier than the people where I come from.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s kind of interesting. Yeah, I used to live in Thailand and I kind of felt the same way to, although Thailand is very
  <span class="audionotes">
   developed
  </span>
  . Any other places that you&#39;ve been to?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  Other places? Maybe in The States.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. Where did you live in the States? Or what did you do in the States?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  When I was in
  <span class="audionotes">
   elementary school
  </span>
  , I lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for five years but after that I also went travelling around the other states, such as San Francisco in California, Los Angeles and New York City, where I like the most and Florida. All the beaches.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, I&#39;m from San Francisco and you said you like New York better that San Francisco, so I have to ask why.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  Why? Because the people in New York, how they live their life, it looks cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, New Yorkers are pretty cool. OK, well thanks Jeyong. Thanks a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeyong:
  </strong>
  No problem. Thank you.
 </p>
