   Ginger
  </strong>
  : So, what about you? You&#39;re still in the same place right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;m still there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Good. How&#39;s it going?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Oh, it&#39;s great. I&#39;m actually quite satisfied with it now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Oh, good because I though you wanted to move at one point.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I thought about it for awhile but then I decided to stay there. There&#39;s a lot of good points there. It&#39;s a quite neighborhood. It&#39;s not too far from the train, so I can get to work easily. For awhile I thought it might be a little too expensive, just slightly above my budget, but I&#39;ve gotten used to it, and my cats love it. They&#39;re really comfortable there, so I think I&#39;m going to stay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Oh, great. I love your cats. Do they have a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   room to roam
  </span>
  around?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : They have enough room. Of course, they&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   better off
  </span>
  in the house. I was living there last year but they&#39;ve adapted pretty well, so there&#39;s a roof there. I can take them up and roam around. There&#39;s plenty of places for them to hide.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Now, what about your neighbors. Are you still living near Matt and Laura.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Matt and Laura.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Right, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Actually, it&#39;s really funny. They&#39;d been there for about four months, and last weekend they invited some people over, about five or six of their colleagues. They had a little party. They played poker, had lots of booze around, but unfortunately, the neighbors complained to the landlord, and the landlords were just really angry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Oh, no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : And sent them this really
  <span class="audionotes">
   harsh e-mail
  </span>
  and said they wanted them out by the end of the week, so yeah, Matt and Laura have been
  <span class="audionotes">
   kicked out
  </span>
  of the building.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : You are kidding.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Wow, and just five people over.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it was like five or six people and apparently it was loud enough. I think it is because the neighborhood is kind of family-oriented, so people are used to people having parties.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Mm, right. Maybe the
  <span class="audionotes">
   voices carry
  </span>
  a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of echo in the building actually for some reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Well, that&#39;s too bad for them. Where did they move?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : They just moved down the street to another apartment building. It&#39;s smaller so I don&#39;t think they&#39;re happy about it. Oh, well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Well, tell them I said &#39;Hey&#39; when you see them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : I will.
