   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Ashley have you ever been horsebackriding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ashley:
  </strong>
  Yes, I&#39;ve actually been horseback riding a numbr of times. My grandparents have horses and my uncle. Actually, there was this one time where I was in Idaho visiting for the summer and my uncle, my grandpa took me on a horseback ride, a whole day trip kind of thing, and you know I&#39;m not so great at the horsebackriding thing, you know, I get a little scared. Horses are pretty big animals, and um, so we were, it was beautiful. We were in the mountains, and we were going up this hill, this trail and we got to the top.

  You know the weather was beautiful when we started out, of course, it always is. We get to the top of the mountain and it starts to rain. Well not only does it start to rain, it starts to pour, and we hear the Thunder in the distance, and the horses get a little scared and the one I was on got really scared, and I look around and my uncle is taking shelter under a tree, and I&#39;m looking around and we&#39;re on the very, very top of this ridge of mountains, the top, like, the highest point, you know, and the lightning is coming and I see the only tree that hasn&#39;t been struck by lighting is the one that my uncle is under with his horse and I&#39;m scared and the horse is going crazy and I&#39;m holding on and I&#39;m thinking, &#34;Oh, my God! I&#39;m going to die!&#34; But we got under the tree and we got down to a lower ridge and we made it, but it was scary.

   Jessica:
  </strong>
  So how apt were you to go back on that horse after that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ashley:
  </strong>
  Oh, well, I went, we finished the ride, and it was fine, after that you know, mountain storms, they come and go so quickly. By the time we got down the mountain we were dry and hot from the sun. But you know, got back on the horse the next day.
