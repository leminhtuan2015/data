   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Greg you were saying you
  <strong>
   had
  </strong>
  brothers and
  <span class="style4">
   they always
   <strong>
    picked
   </strong>
   on you
  </span>
  like all older brothers do.
 </font>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   Do you have any stories about what your brothers used to do to you?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   Ah, yes, you know I think back on some of the
   <span class="style4">
    crazy fights
   </span>
   we had and it is absolutely amazing that we are all still alive.

   One time, I was closing the garage door and I didn&#39;t
   <strong>
    see
   </strong>
   my brother, my oldest brother walking behind me and I
   <strong>
    pulled
   </strong>
   the door down and it
   <strong>
    hit
   </strong>
   him in the head.

   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   <span class="style4">
    A complete accident
   </span>
   , but he just
   <strong>
    got
   </strong>
   so angry. He
   <strong>
    had
   </strong>
   a pair of shoes that he was holding in his hand, and I think he was going to polish them or something, and he just
   <strong>
    took
   </strong>
   the shoe and
   <span class="style4">
    he
    <strong>
     smacked
    </strong>
    me
   </span>
   as hard as he could right in the stomach.

   Oh, that&#39;s gotta hurt.

   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   Oh, it
   <strong>
    hurt
   </strong>
   so much. I
   <strong>
    bent
   </strong>
   over and I
   <strong>
    got
   </strong>
   so angry and I
   <strong>
    looked
   </strong>
   in the garage and I
   <strong>
    saw
   </strong>
   a big piece of metal pipe

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, no!

 <p>

   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   And
   <span class="style4">
    I
    <strong>
     held
    </strong>
    it like a spear
   </span>
   , and I
   <strong>
    ran
   </strong>
   after him, and he of course
   <strong>
    ran
   </strong>
   away. I was chasing him around the house and he
   <strong>
    ran
   </strong>
   into the front door, and I
   <strong>
    threw
   </strong>
   the spear, as hard as I could, and it went like a, I
   <strong>
    threw
   </strong>
   the pipe, and it
   <strong>
    went
   </strong>
   like a spear, through the air, and he
   <strong>
    closed
   </strong>
   the door right behind him, and it
   <strong>
    put
   </strong>
   a hole in the door.

    Todd:

   Oh, man, it was gonna hit him. It would have hit him.

   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   It would have hit him actually.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Wow. You don&#39;t even want to think what could have happened if it had hit him.

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   Yeah, it&#39;s amazing that we&#39;re still alive. We used to have fights with baseball bats and branches and things.

   <strong>
    Todd:

   Well, it must have been good,

    made

   you tough and strong for all the other kids at school.
