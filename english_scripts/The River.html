 So, Jeff, we&#39;re talking about your trip down the Amazon, and so you took a truck to the Amazon and then you got a canoe. You got on a canoe. Can you talk about your journey down the Amazon?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  The Amazon... What people think of the Amazon is a beautiful river with a nice green jungle and lots of animals, and it&#39;s not like that. It&#39;s not a beautiful place. It was... the river was muddy and dirty. It looked like coffee. The side of the river, the side of the Amazon was very
  <span class="audionotes">
   overgrown
  </span>
  and full of mosquitos and black flies. We didn&#39;t see any wild animals because the canoe was just a long, thin wooden canoe
  <span class="audionotes">
   piled high
  </span>
  with things like rice and food other materials that the villagers needed and it had an
  <span class="audionotes">
   outboard motor
  </span>
  that was very noisy, so it wasn&#39;t romantic at all, the ideas of the Amazon river, and the beauty and the adventure. It was difficult and dirty and hot and dangerous, so
  <span class="audionotes">
   it wasn&#39;t romantic at all
  </span>
  .

   Todd:
  </strong>
  It doesn&#39;t sound like it. Where did you stay as you would go down? Would you sleep on the canoe?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  No. Every night they would stop at a little village, and it was just made out of little village, a little
  <span class="audionotes">
   cluster
  </span>
  of bamboo thatched houses just on the side of the river. They&#39;d clear a little spot out of the jungle and then they&#39;d have a, say a dozen bamboo houses there and we&#39;d sleep say on the floor of one of their houses in our sleeping bags.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Were these houses made especially for travellers?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  No, no. There was no travelers. There&#39;s no houses for travelers. These are just with the villagers. There&#39;s no restaurants or no hotels. There are no internet cafes. Half the villages didn&#39;t have power, so it was real basic village life.
 </p>
 <p>

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
