   Matt:
  </strong>
  So, Rachel, where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from Scotland.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Okay, Okay. Scotland like, what&#39;s the biggest city in Scotland would you say?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  The capitol city is Edinburgh but the biggest city, size-wise and population
  <span class="audionotes">
   -wise
  </span>
  is Glasgow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Okay and you lived in ...? Did you live in one of those two cities?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  My grandparents lived in Edinburgh and I lived in Glasgow for quite awhile at university.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Okay. I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   under the impression
  </span>
  that there&#39;s a lot of rain in that area. Is that true or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, pretty much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we both come from rainy climates.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the West Coast of Scotland gets more rain that the east coast, so it&#39;s Glasgow that gets more rain than Edinburgh but Edinburgh has this very
  <span class="audionotes">
   bitter cold
  </span>
  wind, and it&#39;s really chilly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  All year round or just in the winter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  No, pretty much all year round. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Interesting. Tell me about Glasgow. What kind of city is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Glasgow? When I was a kid was actually sort of very
  <span class="audionotes">
   rundown
  </span>
  , and it used to be famous for boat building and industry. But yeah, when I was a kid, I mean it was famous for being a very rough town and lots of unemployment. Lots of social problems, and then it just went through a kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   renaissance
  </span>
  and got lots of money from the European Union and then the town just totally transformed. When I go back it&#39;s so different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  How is it different? Is it like more of a center for art than it was? Or is it ...? Like what&#39;s different?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  It did become a city of culture. And I think that reflects the sort of liveliness of the people of Glasgow. Like they&#39;re just, they have such a good sense of humor. They&#39;re very friendly. Quite different from Edinburgh where they&#39;re much more reserved I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  People are a little
  <span class="audionotes">
   uptight
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yes, yes, so .. not uptight but they&#39;re not so friendly as Glaswegians.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Glaswegians!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yes.
