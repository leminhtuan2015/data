  Maria
 </strong>
 : So Alex, now we talked about what I would like to do in the future, what about you? Career wise, let&#39;s start with that.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I actually have absolutely no idea what I want to do as a career. I know I want to do something interesting and I want to do something fun. I&#39;ve certainly, I think that I as a person am most
  <span class="audionotes">
   suited
  </span>
  to a service style industry or a hospitality something like that where I would be, I&#39;ve had sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   dalliances
  </span>
  or ideas about cafes, cafe chains, certainly I&#39;d always wanted to I think maybe
  <span class="audionotes">
   rival
  </span>
  Starbucks would be lovely. I looked at restaurants. Restaurants didn&#39;t really appeal to me because you&#39;ve got weird hours and when everyone is having fun you&#39;re not. What else? For me it&#39;s, I just like to be able to have something that was constantly enjoyable. I think, you know, what you said,
  <span class="audionotes">
   dynamic
  </span>
  you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : You can have something that will be enjoyable and you can change it up every day and so on and so forth but as to what I specifically would do, I can&#39;t put a name to it. I&#39;m not the only one in my family. My father has a
  <span class="audionotes">
   CV
  </span>
  that&#39;s four, sorry ten pages long. It&#39;s ten pages long. He&#39;s changed jobs I think twenty six times, twenty seven now, and he&#39;s just so I don&#39;t know. For me I&#39;d like to travel but I&#39;d certainly want to have a home base. I can&#39;t go too far away from home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : When you say home, would it be your present home like Australia or would you...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;ve got to say I&#39;m an Aussie, true blue Aussie. I&#39;ve got a love of the country. It&#39;s my home. I have spent time overseas. I&#39;ve lived a year and a half in Canada, a year and a half in Australia, a year and a half in Asia sorry it&#39;s not a year and a half in Australia, a year and a half in America, so I&#39;ve done a couple of other things and I&#39;ve always come back and been why did I leave? What caused me to leave? So, yeah, I&#39;m torn between doing things that are
  <span class="audionotes">
   altruistic
  </span>
  and selfish. Do I want to just work for me and get the money, the
  <span class="audionotes">
   moolah, the cash, the green
  </span>
  , or do I want to do something a bit more for everyone else and I don&#39;t know it&#39;s difficult to decide. How do I do both?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : So the future is open?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : It is open isn&#39;t it?
 </p>
