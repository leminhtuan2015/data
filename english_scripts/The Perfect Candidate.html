  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : So what are some of the characteristics of the women and the girls who always win?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Well, you know, they have – well, recently, they did a sort of like a reality show. And like the whole country get to see what&#39;s happening in this Miss Venezuela organization. And they are always looking for something
  <span class="audionotes">
   trendy
  </span>
  , like what&#39;s popular in America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : If there&#39;s a blonde girl or a
  <span class="audionotes">
   brunette
  </span>
  or – and normally, tall with all the perfect, 90-60-90 – is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Hmm?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : 90-60-90 I think is the perfect…
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh, you&#39;re talking about measurements?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yeah, the body.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Like body size measurements.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yes. Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Right. So that&#39;s important too, obviously.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yes. Yeah. That&#39;s really important. Yeah. Also the hair, the eyes, the teeth, everything. Yeah, so they think about many, many things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : So it&#39;s all based on
  <span class="audionotes">
   physical appearance
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yes, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Of course it&#39;s a beauty pageant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Of course, they go under a training, I heard, of almost one year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : So they train them in terms of how to express themselves using proper language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : And yeah, and also beauty; how to make-up, how to fix their hair or something like…
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay. So like maintenance and self –
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yes, exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Self presentation, I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yes, yes, yes. Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Wow. What about – I don&#39;t know much about beauty pageants, so but I&#39;ve heard or I&#39;ve noticed that you have to have a skill as well, don&#39;t you? An extra, a special skill like what&#39;s your, what are you going to present to the judges as your additional skill. Is that the case?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s more like American beauty pageants.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : So in Venezuela, they are not introduced like, they don&#39;t introduce to the audience a skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : They just go there and do the swimsuit competition and the
  <span class="audionotes">
   evening gown
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : And then, a question.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : And then they&#39;re crowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : What kind of question might it be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Well, they have many kind of questions but sometimes the questions are really difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : But normally, it&#39;s about life, about world peace, about helping others, philanthropic activities. Yeah, that kind…
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Off the top of your head, can you give an example of a question that…?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : An example?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Like once, a girl was asked what&#39;s the difference between forgive and asking for permission. Like she had to explain what&#39;s the difference when you as for a permission and when you ask for forgiveness.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh so, it&#39;s like a grammar question?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Some sort of. The thing is that she
  <span class="audionotes">
   fainted
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : She fainted?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : She couldn&#39;t answer. It was too much. And because, they&#39;re young. I mean, we&#39;re talking about girls 17, 18 years old, students. They were wearing lots of things. They&#39;re nervous. They&#39;re in front of millions of people and…
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s a lot of pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yeah. And yeah, maybe you say like, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s an easy question.&#34; But
  <span class="audionotes">
   at that particular moment
  </span>
  , it might not be easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah, of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : And plus, they don&#39;t eat because they need to fit in their dress.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh my goodness.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : That just sounds so intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : It is. It&#39;s like a marathon or something.
