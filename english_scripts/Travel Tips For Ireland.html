   Joel:
  </strong>
  So, if I go to Ireland, what kind of food do you recommend that I eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  The nicest things are probably Irish
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/638-1-stew.mp3">
   stew
  </a>
  , which is made with lamb and also it&#39;s quite famous for it&#39;s seafood. Every year in Galway, there&#39;s an oyster festival.

   Joel:
  </strong>
  Oysters are big
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Oysters are quite popular.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  And you already mentioned Guinness. Does every one drink Guinness or are there other big
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No,

  </a>
  that much my young people, more by older people who drink it, and also Irish coffee is really nice. It&#39;s like coffee with sugar and whisky in it and cream that floats on the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Really, people drink that in the morning?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  More as a dessert, after your dinner, as a dessert.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  And just for places to travel around Ireland, what are the big sightseeing places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  If you&#39;re in the city, there&#39;s a lot of shopping. There&#39;s also Trinity College, which is the oldest college in Dublin that has a book called The Book of Kells which is a really old book that was handdrawn by monks in Ireland that&#39;s really beautiful. There&#39;s also a place called Newgrange in Kildare which is an old
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/638-3-burial-site.mp3">
   burial site
  </a>
  and on the shortest day of the year it is built in such a way that the sunshines directly through the door and into the very center of the
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/638-4-chamber.mp3">
   chamber
  </a>
  . Other than that. If you want nightlife the best place to go is probably Galway. Galway is really popular.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Galway! I would have thought Dublin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Dublin is popular but it&#39;s quite expensive and a lot of people, if they want a weekend away from Dublin will go to Galway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Actually, from say London, what is the best way to get to Galway or to get to Dublin?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  To get to Dublin, flight is the best way, but you can probably get a return ticket if you book in advance for maybe the equivalent of 6,000 (Yen) return and it only takes fifty minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  To get to Galway, probably from Dublin you can get the train. The train is probably the easiest way, but it does take a few hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  And then in the cities themselves, is there a good train system, or does everyone drive a car?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  In Dublin city there is a train to the suburbs but often it&#39;s delayed or, you know, not on time. It&#39;s pretty bad, and can be a bit expensive and also the intercity trains can be quite expensive. A lot of people have cars but if you live in the city, because there&#39;s so much traffic it can be quite hard getting around in a car and sometimes it&#39;s better to wait for the bus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see. I think I&#39;m gonna need some help when I go out there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Probably if you&#39;re visiting, yeah.
