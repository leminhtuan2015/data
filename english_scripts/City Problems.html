   Michael
  </b>
  : So how’s crime in the big cities, like in Rome? How is crime in Rome?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : Well, many people are complaining for the huge immigration. Like we have many foreigners and illegal foreigners actually. They come in with boats during the night, they’re landing, and we cannot control, we cannot stop them because Italy is in the middle of Europe. So from Northern Africa, for many like – I wouldn’t say underdeveloped countries but the countries that see Italy like the…
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Win
  </b>
  : Dream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : America or like dream, like opportunities, which is changing right with the recent crisis.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : It’s actually very interesting because we have the same problem in Norway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Win
  </b>
  : I’m seeing the same problem everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : Because of the European economic agreement, it’s actually illegal to come and try to find work. But the problem is that people abused us and they come – they are just to, you know –
  <span class="audionotes">
   beg
  </span>
  for money or to steal money or steal things from others. And it’s really easy to pass the border without being controlled.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : I don’t think those people are bad. It’s like
  <span class="audionotes">
   poverty
  </span>
  makes you bad.
 </p>

   Michael
  </b>
  : No, I’m not saying they’re bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Win
  </b>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Goron
  </b>
  : If you are
  <span class="audionotes">
   desperate
  </span>
  , you feel desperate, you do something that is, like we say, illegal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Michael
  </b>
  : And that’s a huge problem because in the EU right now, there’s several countries which have poverty, and it evolves from that, I think. It’s really hard like to create, to make everyone happy and to – I don’t think it’s possible to solve the poverty matter.
  <br>
  So what about Vietnam?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Win
  </b>
  : Well, the city I’m living in is very – there is no really people who was born in the city. I mean, I was born in the city but I have
  <span class="audionotes">
   roots
  </span>
  from everywhere. And most of the people from the city is like that. We They’re from everywhere from the country and the city welcomes them
  <span class="audionotes">
   no matter what
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  So yes, we do have a problem that people keep
  <span class="audionotes">
   flocking
  </span>
  to my city to find jobs, and we have crimes and everything. But I think the fact that we have multi-origin people is one of the facts that makes the city interesting.
