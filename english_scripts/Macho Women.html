   John
  </strong>
  : Okay. So Sarah, you said you participated in rodeos before but I thought only men ride horses in rodeos?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Like 99.9% of the time, the men do all of the rodeo sports. There&#39;s like two sports for women and the rest of them are all for men.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : When I said I wanted to do the traditionally male events, they said, &#34;You can&#39;t do that. You&#39;re a woman. You have to do these other events that are not dangerous. They&#39;re safe.&#34;
  <br>
  For example, the men do calf roping. You work with a baby cow, a calf that&#39;s about 100 pounds. The women do goat roping.
 </p>
 <p>
  And they work with a tiny goat that&#39;s about the size of a small dog. So I just always thought the difference was stupid. I don&#39;t want to do the easy, safe event. I want to do the difficult event and people were really surprised. And first, they said, &#34;You can&#39;t.&#34; And I said, &#34;I&#39;m going to
  <span class="audionotes">
   anyways
  </span>
  .&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : And the first time I did the saddle bronc, they said, &#34;Look, look, look. We got you a girl horse because you&#39;re a girl.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh my.
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="image" height="274" src="../../Assets/images/P1351/1383-Sarah-MachoWomen.jpg" width="411">
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : And I thought, &#34;Well, you didn&#39;t need to
  <span class="audionotes">
   draw more attention
  </span>
  to it. I just want to compete like everyone else.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : And my first time, I fell off the horse and I was really injured. And I was laying there and one of my friends came running out. And he said – I thought he was going to help me up and help me leave because I was really hurt. And instead he said, &#34;Hurry up! You got to get off the – you get out of the arena because the next person wants to go.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh, wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : And I was really happy that he said that actually because he was just
  <span class="audionotes">
   treating me
  </span>
  the way he treated any other competitor. &#34;Oh, get up. Be
  <span class="audionotes">
   tough
  </span>
  . You&#39;re fine.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : And I didn&#39;t want anyone to help me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : So he didn&#39;t help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Right. And I was really glad that he was treating me like everyone else. And when you see a rodeo, you&#39;ll see that the women do events where they can dress really nice. They always wear nice clothes, beautiful hat. They even have earrings and things on.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when the men do events, they&#39;re doing events that they really have to use their muscles and get dirty, and I really liked doing those instead. I&#39;m not saying one is better than the other, I&#39;m just saying I like to do the other one and I think that maybe other women like to do the other events, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : So do you think that the situation is improving? Are more girls joining rodeo now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t think so. I think the sport of rodeo is becoming less popular. So I think in the future, there won&#39;t be more women in rodeo. There will just be fewer people in rodeo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Because the rodeo events, they&#39;re not very kind to the cows or the other animals. And as people get older, maybe they get more
  <span class="audionotes">
   softhearted
  </span>
  like me, and they don&#39;t want to make the animals get
  <span class="audionotes">
   tied up
  </span>
  or chase the animals. And so I think fewer people are interested in rodeo these days.
