 Hi, Sabriya. This is almost the end of the year, so tell me, how was your year 2007?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  My year was quite interesting. I learned a lot. I&#39;ve experienced a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  You&#39;ve experienced a lot. What have you experienced?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve tried new things. Things that I have not done before. I&#39;ve tried different jobs.

   Fred:
  </strong>
  What kind of jobs have you tried?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve tried working with children, actually, this year and it&#39;s been amazing. It&#39;s just been
  <span class="audionotes">
   the best experience ever
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  What was it exactly that you did when you were working with children?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Basically, it was in a... it&#39;s not
  <span class="audionotes">
   a rehabilitation center
  </span>
  , but it was a center for disabled children, and basically what we do is we spend the day with them and attend classes with them and just play with them, talk to them, interact with them during the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s really great. So you did some
  <span class="audionotes">
   voluntary activities
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Yes. Yes. I did for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s really cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  <span class="style6">
   It was quite an experience
  </span>
  because I was quite scared at first. I wasn&#39;t to sure how to treat them.
  <span class="style6">
   I wasn&#39;t to sure
  </span>
  what exactly I should do, but the instructors were very nice and they explained that, you know, you just have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   be yourself
  </span>
  and treat them like any other children, and that&#39;s how they want to be treated - just like normal children, and that&#39;s what I tried my best to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Wow, so you must have learned so much, and you became a more responsible,
  <span class="style6">
   mature adult
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Yes, it did. It changed me in that terms because I become more patient than before. Before, I mean,
  <span class="style6">
   I used to be quite stubborn
  </span>
  and I used to irrationally make decisions, but after this I calmed down and
  <span class="audionotes">
   I always questioned myself
  </span>
  before doing something, so I think in that way I completely changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Could you say that what you&#39;ve learned through your experiences of working with children has also helped you in other parts of your life?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  I think the whole getting
  <span class="style6">
   a patient side
  </span>
  has helped me in many terms because it&#39;s made me think for example, when I want study or when I want to take classes, I always ask myself, should I do this? Should I do that? Should I go here? So, I don&#39;t think like that, so it&#39;s just a matter of thinking ten times before I decide anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  OK, well you know I feel that I can learn a lot from you and maybe I should do the same thing to become a more responsible person, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  You should. I&#39;d advise you to. Working with disabled children is nothing like anything else. It&#39;s amazing. You should. You should.
