   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Monica, you do Tai Chi?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yes, I&#39;ve just joined a Tai Chi club?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What made you join the Tai Chi club?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Well, I wanted to do something that was a lot different to what I usually do, which is
  <span class="audionotes">
   high impact sports
  </span>
  like basketball and tennis.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you wanted to do something that was slower?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, I don&#39;t usually enjoy exercise that is quite slow such as yoga, but I decided to join this club and I&#39;m really enjoying it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what exactly is Tai Chi? What do you do in Tai Chi?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Well, there are different types of Tai Chi. There&#39;s the original Tai Chi which involves quick fast movements, and then there&#39;s a slower form of Tai Chi which is quite popular in Japan. I think it&#39;s called Mr. Young Tai Chi, and that involves very slow pronounced movements, and that&#39;s the Tai Chi that I&#39;m doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How do you feel? Like after you do Tai Chi, do you feel tired? Do you feel energetic?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  After I&#39;ve done Tai Chi I feel quite energetic actually. I don&#39;t really feel tired because I haven&#39;t had a really hard workout, but I feel that my mind is very relaxed and focused and that I&#39;m very motivated to do whatever I need to do
  <span class="audionotes">
   for the rest of the day
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, you actually are a tennis coach, so you teach sports. Would you recommend Tai Chi for other athletes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I do recommend Tai Chi for other athletes. It&#39;s quite difficult to know exactly how you would benefit from Tai Chi, and how it can directly relate a specific sport, but I&#39;ve heard that it works on your
  <span class="audionotes">
   energy levels
  </span>
  , and focuses your mind so that everything is in balance, and I think that can help in kind of sport because even in a sport like tennis, it&#39;s important to have balance when you&#39;re hitting the ball, when you&#39;re volleying, when you&#39;re getting ready for
  <span class="audionotes">
   a smash
  </span>
  . It actually involves having balance in terms of where your
  <span class="audionotes">
   center of gravity
  </span>
  is, so yeah, the concepts are similar.
 </p>
