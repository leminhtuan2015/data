  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  So, you mentioned coasteering. What is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  Right. What it is, it&#39;s organized by some groups of people. It can be quite dangerous but it&#39;s very
  <span class="audionotes">
   well-run
  </span>
  in that you all go out in wetsuits, and you&#39;ll go out for a few hours around the coast and what you basically do, is you&#39;re walking around the rocks of the coast right on the sea level, so areas that you can&#39;t actually walk around the coast on the rocks, you jump in the sea and swim, so lots of people like to do that, cause it&#39;s a little more dangerous with the sea currents and all the activities. You know, you could get
  <span class="audionotes">
   stuck
  </span>
  and ... but, you know, it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   handled
  </span>
  very well and it&#39;s quite a thrilling sport to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  So, I guess you can like do jumping into the sea ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  You jump in. They mainly ... you know they do it carefully, they mainly get you to jump in. Where you can&#39;t climb the rocks, you jump in and swim round to another area. You can climb up and it&#39;s just basically going from cove to cove on the sea ... on the sea level ... and around the sea rather than being up on the cliff, on the land walking around seeing the scenery you&#39;re actually down ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Have you had a go at it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  No, but I would like to. I can&#39;t find anybody to go with me yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  So, if I was going to do coasteering, what kind of equipment would I need?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  I think they provide you with a full length wetsuit and the shoes that go with it as well. You&#39;d also need ... probably to be a pretty good swimmer. You can&#39;t really go unless you can swim pretty well. But they have guides with you all the time. You don&#39;t go out in a group and do it on your own because that&#39;s far too dangerous. They know exactly the best places to go and I think it would probably cost, a day&#39;s activity like that, would probably cost you thirty pound each, I would imagine. I haven&#39;t been myself so I don&#39;t know exactly but ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Thirty pounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Which is quite a lot of money but it is good fun and it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   not something you&#39;d do every day
  </span>
  . It&#39;s a, you know, once a year ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Sounds pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   reasonable
  </span>
  , to me, for a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  Well, there&#39;s some beautiful things you can see. You see a lot more from that level down at the sea than you would ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Oh, right. OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  Very often you&#39;ll have things like the sea lions or whatever you see close up the seals, sorry not the sea lions. You&#39;ll see close up and lots of different fish and things that you may not get to see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Any sharks?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  No dangerous ones anyway. But you may see dolphins. We do have dolphins that come up and ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  ... oh nice
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharron:
  </strong>
  Yeah, really good. I don&#39;t think they come very close but then, you know, they can be seen.
