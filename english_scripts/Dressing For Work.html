   Sarah
  </strong>
  : So John, what do you think about tattoos and piercings?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh. Well, I think they&#39;re okay. Personally, I have my ears pierced, and I have many tattoos. But in the professional world, different people have different ideas. So I had to make sure all of my tattoos can be covered by a t-shirt, so any person who sees me doesn&#39;t know that I have any tattoos.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I personally think tattoos are okay. So if I saw a police officer with many tattoos on her arms and her neck, I wouldn&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   have a problem with
  </span>
  it. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Do you think in the future, maybe as you and I grow up, it will become more common to go to the doctor or maybe go to the bank and you see people, and they are professional people, but they have
  <span class="audionotes">
   visible
  </span>
  tattoos or earrings?
 </p>
 <p>
  I also have a tattoo. So I think they&#39;re okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : I agree. I think that in the future, it will be more and more
  <span class="audionotes">
   commonplace
  </span>
  to see people who have visible tattoos and piercings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, right now, people are having more and more visible tattoos that are very small. But maybe in the future, tattoos will be bigger and bigger. I think it&#39;s the same with
  <span class="audionotes">
   piercings
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Nowadays, it&#39;s normal to see women and men who have their ears pierced. But it&#39;s still not common to see a professional working with their nose pierced or their eyebrows pierced. Maybe in the future that will be common as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I think so. But one thing that I think won&#39;t change is professional clothing. I think these days and the future, I think a nice suit, a professional collared shirt, ironed pants – I think those type of clothes are really important for your job or for the type of job if you want a promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I think in the future, we&#39;ll see people with really nice professional clothing and then they might have visible tattoos or earrings. I think your clothes show how important your job is to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : I see what you&#39;re saying. If I was trying to hire a lawyer and I saw two lawyers and both of them had tattoos and their ears pierced, but if one of the lawyers was wearing a suit, even if that person have tattoos and piercings, if they&#39;re wearing a suit, I would rather choose that lawyer than someone who had tattoos and piercings who was wearing a t-shirt and shorts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Uh-hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : So I agree with you that the clothing is more important for professional image.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : What do you think – these days, some of the computer companies or tech startups, the CEOs are young people and they&#39;ll go to work wearing jeans or shorts and a t-shirt. And they like to portray a casual atmosphere through their clothes. What do you think about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, in my opinion, the
  <span class="audionotes">
   environment
  </span>
  at a job, as long as everyone working there is in the same environment, maybe they should be able to choose what kind of professional
  <span class="audionotes">
   attire
  </span>
  is appropriate inside of that company. But the problem would arise when those workers have to interact with people from another company.
 </p>
 <p>
  So if another company has a dress code where everyone is wearing suits and these two companies have to work together, there might be a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s strange that clothes seem like they&#39;re so important. The knowledge and the product should be important but I think everyone looks at the clothes and makes a judgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s interesting that we all know the saying &#34;
  <span class="audionotes">
   Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover
  </span>
  &#34; but we can&#39;t help but do that. Everyone is judging people by what they wear, and that&#39;s not going to change.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I agree.
