   Greg:
  </strong>
  Hi, Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Greg.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Hey, thanks a lot for interviewing me and letting, I don&#39;t know, the world know about my book.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, problem. It&#39;s a good book.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;ve noticed you don&#39;t have any topics like these on your web site. Why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. I don&#39;t have too many controversial topics. There&#39;s actually technical reasons. One is it just takes too long for people to talk about a controversial topic, so for example if you really want to get into controversy, you know, it leads to long conversation and people expressing their view and arguing and the way that the audio is set up on elllo, it&#39;s kind of short. I try to keep it under three minutes, so that&#39;s one reason. But actually the main reason is because, you know, when people come in, I don&#39;t know them a lot of the times I don&#39;t know the speakers very well and so they&#39;re not really comfortable arguing with me or arguing with somebody else they don&#39;t know about something that&#39;s controversial, so we tend to not do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  OK, alright,
  <span class="redhighlight">
   it&#39;s something you might want to think about
  </span>
  . I mean, I think there are lot of people in the world who are really interested in controversial topics.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I think there are some, like with you we talked about some like
  <span class="audionotes">
   income disparity
  </span>
  and medical issues, and I&#39;m comfortable talking about that but I am not comfortable talking about let&#39;s say homosexuality, religious beliefs, abortion, politics. Things like that I just don&#39;t feel comfortable doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  OK, it&#39;s your site: your right to do whatever you want, but I just think maybe ... maybe some of your listeners would appreciate that and maybe you could have ... my suggestion is that you have a little one page, controversial page, or something. Just, you know, try it out, and if you get a lot of good reaction, you might want to continue and if it doesn&#39;t work out stop it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, I&#39;ll give you an example of one I did recently. I had a woman come in, Stella, she did a great job on the videos, and one of her videos was about an usual sport in your country and hers was on cock fighting, and she explained cock fighting, or hen fighting, in Kenya, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   right off the bat
  </span>
  I knew that was going to be a problem because that&#39;s illegal in some countries and some people -
  <span class="audionotes">
   animal activists
  </span>
  - would be offended, but on the other hand, it&#39;s her culture and I don&#39;t feel comfortable saying - you know - what&#39;s right or what&#39;s wrong about someone else&#39;s culture so I just ended up not putting it on just because I didn&#39;t want to have to take a side. You know, I think you can kind of see the problem, that sometimes you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   put stuff up
  </span>
  and it&#39;s so easy to
  <span class="audionotes">
   alienate
  </span>
  maybe a small portion of your audience and I just don&#39;t want to do that. You know, I don&#39;t have a side about the issue but I just don&#39;t want to
  <span class="redhighlight">
   alienate people
  </span>
  . I don&#39;t want people on one side of an issue to feel upset so I just play it safe, and I don&#39;t talk about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  OK, well, you seem to have a lot of listeners who are very happy so don&#39;t worry about changing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I hope so. I hope so.
