   Mari:
  </strong>
  Hi, this is Mari. I&#39;m here with Ron. Today, we&#39;ll talk about types of entertainment and how often we do these things. Let&#39;s first start with watching TV. Ron, how often do you watch TV?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Usually I watch TV every day. I don&#39;t watch TV very long but I usually watch TV every day. Usually I watch the news.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Why
  <span class="audionotes">
   just
  </span>
  the news?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I like to know what&#39;s going on in the world, so I usually watch CNN or BBC.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  And that&#39;s it. Nothing else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Usually, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Usually?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Other than that
  </span>
  , sometimes I&#39;ll watch sporting events such as baseball or football.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  But that&#39;s it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  OK, next, do you go to the movies? How often do you go to the movies?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t go to the movies very often, maybe twice a year, I would say.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Do you rent movies?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I rent movies more than I go to the cinema, but also not very often.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What kind of movies do you like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I like funny movies. Comedies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Comedies. What&#39;s the most recent movie you watched?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I watched Home Alone last night but it was on TV. I didn&#39;t rent the movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  OK. How often do you read books?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t like reading, so I don&#39;t read books very often. The only time I do read books is for school
  <span class="audionotes">
   purposes
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What kind of books do you read for school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Well, my
  <span class="audionotes">
   major
  </span>
  is International Relations, so usually I read International Relations books, if I have to read.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  If you have to read. So nothing? No books for pleasure?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Not for entertainment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  So when you&#39;re on the airplane, you don&#39;t read?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  No. I try to watch the movies on the airplane.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  OK. How often do you go to concerts?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I go to concerts
  <span class="audionotes">
   once in awhile
  </span>
  . In Hawaii, there aren&#39;t many concerts so when they&#39;re are concerts, I try to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What do you go see, or what type of concerts?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I like Hawaiian music so I go to Hawaiian concerts, and if a big star from America comes, I usually try to go also.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  So music concerts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Right, music concerts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  OK, Ron, thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
