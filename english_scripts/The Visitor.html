   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey Leath!
 </p>
 <p>
  Do you want to go ahead and talk about the story you we&#39;re going to say?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leath:
  </strong>
  OK. Yeah, this was about-- I&#39;d say a year and a half ago and it was in Harare the capital, where my mom lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   on holiday
  </span>
  back home seeing my mom and anyway it&#39;s a Sunday morning and I was in the shower.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Got up pretty late, it must have been about half ten and all of a sudden my mom
  <span class="audionotes">
   burst into
  </span>
  the shower and she says,&#34; Leath, Leath, there&#39;s a snake, there&#39;s a snake in the kitchen.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  And so I thought, &#34;Ah, what kind of snake would this be?&#34; because we live in the capital, residential area almost high-rise. Well, not high rise but residential area.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so I put a towel around my waist and walked
  <span class="audionotes">
   bad-temperedly
  </span>
  throught to the kitchen. Attached to the kitchen we&#39;ve got this little courtyard where we set out to have morning coffee and breakfast. It&#39;s tiled and leads onto a small garden. And so I walked out onto the courtyard and there was a seven foot Egyptian cobra. Wow! I was really, really blown away because I know a bit about snakes and I know that a bite from an Egyptian cobra in a country where antidote isn&#39;t readily available is almost certainly fatal. And there we were, my mom and I, with a seven foot Egyptian cobra slithering between the courtyard and our kitchen. And, eventually, we trapped it in the courtyard and I went to fetch guys who work for national parks. National parks are the guys who kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   look after
  </span>
  animal problems
                                          within the city and
  <span class="audionotes">
   brought them around.
  </span>
  And we were hoping that they were going to catch it because Zimbabwe isn&#39;t so rich at the moment and stuff like that. They don&#39;t have the facilities to keep caught animals so unless it&#39;s endangered they just shoot it, so the guy shot our seven foot cobra.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, they shot it huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leath:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and we had to bury it out back.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really? Well, still I&#39;m glad you just didn&#39;t want to be bitten or anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leath:
  </strong>
  No, no. No way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What a story. Thanks!
 </p>
