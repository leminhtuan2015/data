  Todd:
 </strong>
 So what island do you live on?
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  I live in Trinidad, on the island of Trinidad. I’m happy that I live in Trinidad, I’m very proud of it because Trinidad is beautiful. Although it’s not
  <span class="audionotes">
   known for
  </span>
  beaches, we have a lot of wetlands like
  <span class="audionotes">
   swamps
  </span>
  and natural
  <span class="audionotes">
   savannah
  </span>
  . I think we are the only island in the Caribbean that has savannah. People usually think that an island is too small to have savannah ‘cause...we have savannah in Trinidad, mangrove forests also. They are also an important part of the ecosystem. But if you meet somebody from Tobago, they will tell you that they are from Tobago and maybe not necessarily from Trinidad and Tobago because they are extremely proud.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  Because Tobago, although we’re one country, they have somewhat of a unique history in that in the colonial days when we were colonized by pretty much everyone from the British, Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese -- Tobago has a very strong Dutch history also. So actually most of the whites who live in Tobago are still of a Dutch or German ancestry. So they are very proud that they have something unique that
  <span class="audionotes">
   sets them apart
  </span>
  from Trinidad and actually the accent is different. You may not be able to tell the difference but we in Trinidad can hear when somebody is from Tobago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  It’s very distinct, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And now but the official language is English, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  English is... We speak English. But now in schools French is being taught compulsory I think for at least the first two to three years depending on which school you go to and Spanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And actually, I’m sorry, it’s not even an
  <span class="audionotes">
   official language
  </span>
  , it’s the native language, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CleAnn:
  </strong>
  Native language. We don’t know any other language but English. It’s native. And we have what we call some Creole languages which are mixtures of English and French. And in Trinidad the Creole language is called Patois and I can’t speak it because it’s very French -- shortened French words and grammar mixed in with some English...what do you call it...the structures of the sentences. It’s extremely interesting if you can ever get a chance to meet someone who speaks Patois and for someone who speaks French. You will never be able to understand them even if you speak French.
