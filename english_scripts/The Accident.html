  So, a funny story then, about my brother. First of all, he&#39;s my twin brother, so he&#39;s the same age as me, 26, and when we were, I think, 8 years old, it was during the summer. It was a very, very hot day, so all the windows in the house were open, and we decided to play
  <span class="audiodef">
   hide and seek
  </span>
  , so my brother, Daniel, he goes upstairs and he sits by the window, on the
  <span class="audiodef">
   window ledge
  </span>
  , and he&#39;s waiting for us to come and find him, so he
  <span class="audiodef">
   leans back
  </span>
  , but not realizing the window&#39;s open he falls out of the window, so he falls about 15 feet and he break both of his arms and all we hear is this screaming and we think, ah you know, he&#39;s just kidding around and them my mom goes out and sees that he&#39;s lying on the floor, one bone sticking out of one arm, the other one&#39;s all twisted, so we call the ambulance and everyone&#39;s crying. My mom is being sick with the shock, and he goes to hospital. We were really, really worried, you know, is he going to die, or whatever, and he was fine. He broke both his arms but he was in hospital for about two weeks I think. Yeah, it was really
  <span class="audiodef">
   nasty
  </span>
  . He&#39;s got a horrible
  <span class="audiodef">
   scar
  </span>
  now.

  Fred:
 </strong>
 Hi, Shibika, so you were telling me that you recently were in a car accident.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Can you tell me what happened?

  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Yeah, in fact,
  <span class="audionotes">
   as I told you before
  </span>
  , I went to India on vacation and I had stopped in Delhi. That&#39;s the capital of India for a day, and I was going out with my friend to watch a movie in his car and he was driving, and he just, there was a turn. He took a turn and he just raced across, He surpassed this car that was going and we dashed across the divider so
  <span class="audionotes">
   I banged my shoulder
  </span>
  into one of the car doors and that is how... so I basically fractured my collarbone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Oh, so you broke your shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  What happened after that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  So, we had to immediately rush to the hospital and he panicked. I was like... I was not really unconscious but the pain was... it pained really bad so I needed pain killer. I needed
  <span class="audionotes">
   an injection
  </span>
  , so I went to the hospital and there they gave me a
  <span class="audionotes">
   pain killer
  </span>
  injection and after that they took an x-ray and then they found it was a fracture so I had to be admitted in the hospital and I was admitted in the hospital immediately and I informed my parents who were not in Delhi, who were in Lucknow. It&#39;s like five hours from Delhi and I informed them the next day so... because I didn&#39;t want to panic them that time. They couldn&#39;t have come to Delhi so. Yeah, so but it was alright. They tied this bandage,
  <span class="audionotes">
   plaster kind of thing
  </span>
  across my neck and that time it hurt really bad. Yeah, it took time to for me to recover.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  So, after you recovered, what was the process. So you had to go through the hospital and then they put the bandage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. I had to be with the bandage on for a really long time, because I couldn&#39;t have taken out the bandage because in a bone fracture you can&#39;t be given any medicines or you can&#39;t be given any external treatment for it to get OK. You know, the only was for it to get OK is it&#39;s gonna heal naturally and with the bones with time. The bones are going to get fixed on their own so I had to on that plaster all the time, while eating, sleeping, no matter what I do, and I had to be in the hospital for a really long time after which I got discharged, say after ten days or something, and then I could have been taken home.
