Iranian state media reports a suicide bombing has killed at least 20 people on the day talks on the Middle East began in Warsaw.
<br><br>
Associated Press, AP, correspondent Charles De Ledesma has the story.
<br><br>
A suicide bomber has targeted a bus in Iran's southeast carrying personnel of elite paramilitary Revolutionary Guard force, killing and wounding dozens.
<br><br>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which came on the day of a U.S.-led conference in Warsaw that included discussions on what America describes as Iran's malign influence across the wider Mideast.
<br><br>
The Guard force is a major economic and military power in Iran, answerable only to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

As Congress works on finalizing a bill that would keep the government running into the weekend, they're keeping an eye on the White House as well.
<br><br>
Associated Press Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports.
<br><br>
Trump says he'll "be looking for land mines" in the bill from Congress, which he has yet to see.
<br><br>
He indicated, however, he is pleased with preliminary figures in the border security deal worked by a committee of Republicans and Democrats, but says the opposition party is being stingy when it comes to funding for the wall.
<br><br>
"We're building a lot of wall right now with money that we already have."
<br><br>
Trump also tells reporters he does not want to see another partial shutdown of the U.S. government, saying that would be a terrible thing.

The American Embassy in Lebanon says the United States has delivered laser-guided rockets valued at more than $16 million to the Lebanese army.
<br><br>
In a statement, it said the delivery demonstrates the U.S. government's "firm and steady commitments" to support the Lebanese military in its capacity as the "sole, legitimate defender [of the country's, of the] of Lebanon."
<br><br>
That reference appeared to be aimed at the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which has an arsenal that rivals that of the Lebanese army and dominates the country's politics.

In a landmark vote, Australian lawmakers have made it easier for sick refugees held offshore to be treated in the country.
<br><br>
It's the first time in almost 80 years that a government has lost a vote on its own legislation in the lower house of parliament.
<br><br>
Correspondent Phil Mercer reports for VOA from Sydney.
<br><br>
The legislation will give doctors a greater say, on which refugees detained offshore can travel to Australia for medical treatments.
<br><br>
Since 2013, Canberra has held asylum-seekers arriving by boats in camps on the tiny republic of Nauru and on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea in the South Pacific, and has insisted they would never be allowed to resettle in Australia.
<br><br>
Doctors have said medical facilities on the islands are inadequate for about 1,000 asylum-seekers and refugees who remain.
<br><br>
<br><br>
President Trump and Colombian President Iv&aacute;n Duque met Wednesday in Washington to talk about efforts to push Venezuela's leftist President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro from power.
