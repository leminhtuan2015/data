  OK, I&#39;m going to talk about my one wish. I think everybody has one or two things they wish they could change about themselves and for me I really wish I could sing. Unfortunately I have a terrible voice. I cannot sing at all, and in Japan, this is very embarrassing because Japanese people love to go to karaoke, and karaoke is when you go with a bunch of friends to a place, a karaoke bar, I guess, or center, and you get a small room and inside the room there are TV&#39;s and songs are on the TV&#39;s. You can choose what songs to watch and then one person sings the song and everyone listens and it&#39;s very popular in Japan and it&#39;s a lot of fun but it&#39;s really embarrassing because I can&#39;t sing and everybody always says, &#34; No, no, no, you sing. Oh, no, it&#39;s OK. It&#39;s OK. Don&#39;t worry. Don&#39;t be embarrassed,&#34; but after I sing, my singing is so bad that everybody doesn&#39;t want me to sing anymore, so it&#39;s also really hard for me because I teach children and I love teaching children and

  when you teach children you need to teach songs, and so I sing many, many songs with my students, for example, &#34;Itsy-Bitsy Spider&#34; or &#34;Row-Row-Row your boat!&#34; or many many songs, but I can&#39;t sing and so luckily the kids really don&#39;t care so usually it&#39;s alright that my voice is really bad but sometimes they tell me, they say, &#34;Sensei, Sensei!&#34; in Japanese, &#34;You&#39;re singing is terrible!&#34; so it&#39;s really embarrassing but I have to do it. Songs are very important for children when they&#39;re little. I think the reason I cannot sing is because unfortunately in my country we don&#39;t sing as children and I really would like this to change. It really bothers me. I&#39;ve noticed in Thailand, in Japan, in other countries that I have taught, children sing in elementary school a lot and in the United States you don&#39;t do this and I think&#39;s it&#39;s terrible because you need to sing when you&#39;re little to train your voice so it can learn tones and so it can learn how to sing properly and because I never learned to sing when I was little it&#39;s almost impossible to learn how to sing when you&#39;re older, so yeah, I really wish I could sing but I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s ever going to be a reality.
