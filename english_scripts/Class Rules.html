  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Marion, how are your classes?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  My classes are quite good
  <span class="audionotes">
   at the moment
  </span>
  . I&#39;m enjoying them. I work in a junior high school and high school together, so my students
  <span class="audionotes">
   range from twelve years old right up to eighteen.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do you teach your students?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  It teach them English.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so communication
  <span class="audionotes">
   basically
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so are they good students? You got nice kids?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  I have a mixuture so, but mainly they&#39;re quite good children. They&#39;re mostly very nice, but there are always going to be a few who are a bit naughty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what do the naughty students do to be naughty?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  Well, in my class
  <span class="audionotes">
   naughty
  </span>
  students don&#39;t pay attention when I speak sometimes, or they talk to their friend next to them when they should be listening or writing or doing something else. I don&#39;t mind if they talk to each other about what we&#39;re doing but if they are talking about what was on TV last night so something like that I don&#39;t like it, unless they do it in English. If they can that&#39;s fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, what do you do if your students are bad, are naughty? How do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   discipline
  </span>
  them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  I hit them....No, I don&#39;t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You do not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m joking, I&#39;m joking. Well, I have quite small classes, so it&#39;s quite easy. I&#39;ll just either call their name or walk down to their seat and if everybody is working on something, I&#39;ll talk to them about their work and see what they&#39;re doing, if they have any problems, that kind of thing and then if it gets worse, then sometimes they have to stand up, or if they are really, really naughty, and don&#39;t do any work, they&#39;ll have to come back and see me after school, and finish their work, then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So are you a strict teacher or a friendly teacher?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m more of a friendly teacher, but with a couple of classes, I&#39;ve become a strict teacher because I have to be, but mostly a friendly teacher I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Who are easier to teach, the junior high students or the high school students?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  Probably the junior high because their more enthusiastic about English. They get quite excited about coming to our classes, and like I said they are small classes so it&#39;s easier and better for them to because they have more chance to speak and to use English.
