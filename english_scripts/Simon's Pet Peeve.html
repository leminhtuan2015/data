   Yeah, I want to talk about one of my pet peeves. You know a pet peeve is something that you as a person don&#39;t like. You personally don&#39;t like a habit or a mannerism or something that other people do, um, for example a pet peeve could be people who don&#39;t like wrinkled shirts or they don&#39;t like it when people chew gum in public, or like the noise that some people make, or habits, mannerisms, for example my grandmother, my grandmother&#39;s pet peeve was, you know, messy clothes or people who wore messy clothes. She didn&#39;t like that, you know, if someone had a whole in their sock, she would sew it up immediately. She just hated it. It was her pet peeve, you know, if you didn&#39;t wear nice, crisp, clean clothes, you know, you know some people&#39;s pet peeve is, you know, when other people talk on the cell phone, ah, things like that. Yeah, my pet peeve is a little more complicated. It&#39;s a little more unique I think then other people&#39;s pet peeves, but it&#39;s when Canadians wear, or embroider, canadian flags on their backpack.

   That&#39;s just something that&#39;s annoying or irritating for me. It&#39;s my pet peeve. I&#39;m Canadian so it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t like Canada or I don&#39;t like Canadians because I am Canadian and I do love my country, but it&#39;s just so cheesy when I see so many travelers, usually the backpacking kind that put Canadian paraphernalia, especially Canadian embroidered flags on their suitcases or backpack. I don&#39;t know why it bothers me. I guess I think it&#39;s not cool, or I can&#39;t see the reason why to do that. I mean, people tell me it&#39;s to show that they&#39;re not American, but, who cares? You should be able to just tell them, &#34;Hey, I&#39;m from, you know, I&#39;m from Canada, I&#39;m from Vancouver, I&#39;m from Toronto, I&#39;m from Saskatchewan, where ever.&#34; Yeah, it&#39;s something I can consider as a personal pet peeve. Don&#39;t do it Canadians.
