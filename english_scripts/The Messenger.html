   Todd:
  </strong>
  Um , Kawabe you said you used to be a bike delivery person.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yes, I was. It was not very long but I was doing that for like 6 months.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you mean push bike or motorcycle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Push bike? What is a push bike?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Push bike is like the one you ride with you legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Oh, no, no. no. The motorcycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Motorcycle! OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yes! Yes! 400 cc. I forget the name of the bike, but it was kind of one really fast, and then, you know what they are doing, they just go, OK, if you are sending a letter, a very important document, you want to send it to somewhere really fast, very, very quickly!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like for a signiture of something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, whatever it is! Like and then, you call me. You call to my company and the company call to my mobile or beeper, and then, &#34;hey Kawabe, you go to that place,&#34; and you get the address, and I look it up in my map, and I go to your place and pick up the thing and deliver to your receiver.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, to the receiver, to the recipient (Yeah), the recipient.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  And then since it&#39;s a bike delivery it&#39;s always something you&#39;ve got to deliver really fast, so which means it&#39;s a really dangerous job, you know, so many people, my colleagues had a car accident.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Definitely, if you,..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Not you right? You were OK?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Not me! Since I thought I, you know, I can have a really big accident if I keep on this job, that is why I quit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Good choice.Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  If you do that job for one year, definitely, you&#39;ll have one accident at least.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Seriouly!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yeah! Seriously!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man, wow! I heard something similar in the U.S. Big truck drivers, on average over their career, kill at least one person.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the same kind of thing, you know! Especially in Tokyo. You know, there&#39;s millions of cars and motorcycles, and people walking on the street, you know it&#39;s really dangerous, and even if you are a safe driver, someone&#39;s gonna hit you, (Yeah) so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s nothing you can do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  You can run away if you are on the street but there&#39;s no place to run away, so, anyway, that was, that was an exciting job. I really enjoyed that because you are always outside. The rainy days, you know, I didn&#39;t like that, but on the sunny day, autumn, spring, and it was great to drive in Tokyo city. You could go everywhere and meet a lot of people and so. Yeah, I met one person, he was a manga writer. How do you say?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, manga writer, sure, yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  And then the publishing company asked me to take, how do you say, the document for the next week?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, like the, the new issue. (Yeah) Yeah, the first draft, or whatever.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and then he had to finish that one like until that day, so &#34;Hey, Kawabe, you go to that manga writer&#39;s house and pick up the documents he&#39;s gonna give you, and then you bring that, the draft, how do you say? (Yeah) **** to the publishing company.&#34; OK, and I&#39;d been to his house and I had to wait like four hours in front of his door cause you know, you can imagine, he couldn&#39;t finish up his work (Yeah, yeah) so he like in every thirty minutes he comes to the door, and says, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m so sorry! I&#39;m gonna finish it in 10 minutes. It will be done in the next 10 minutes.&#34; And then he goes back and I wait and I just kept waiting from the door and actually, four hours later, he gave me the manga.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really! (Yeah!) Did you read it on the way?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  No, yeah, I was really tempted but I couldn&#39;t do that, and yeah, I brought that to the publishing company. That was so funny!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool story!
