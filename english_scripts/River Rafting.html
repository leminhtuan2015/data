  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Mark you said that you do crazy things when you travel. Can you give an example?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, one of the best things that I did was white water rafting in New Zealand. We actually rafted down the highest
  <span class="audionotes">
   commercially
  </span>
  rafted water fall in the world, I was told at that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What does that mean, the highest commercial waterfall?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Well, I think it&#39;s the one that&#39;s can only be taken by tour groups because it&#39;s safe. If it&#39;s any higher then that one, then
  <span class="audionotes">
   it&#39;s deemed unsafe
  </span>
  and they wouldn&#39;t be able to take tour groups rafting. You&#39;d have to be a professional rafter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you go over the top?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  We went straight over the top, yeah. It was crazy. And I was sat right at the back of the raft and they called this
  <span class="audionotes">
   the ejector seat
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  But actually, everybody was thrown out of the raft, but they give you some instructions before you can go and you are thrown down into the waterfall and the instructor&#39;s basically tell you curl up into a ball and if you
  <span class="audionotes">
   curl up
  </span>
  into a ball the waterfall actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   spits you out,
  </span>
  shoots you back out the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah. So I did, and it worked. I was happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So did you camp over night or was it just a one day event?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  No, this was just a one day, just to do that one waterfall. We wanted to do the highest one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  But I would like to go on - I think in Europe, especially, if you go to a place like Turkiye, Spain, you can do like four and five day raft trips, where you camp as well at the side. I&#39;d like to do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that sounds nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, in the States it&#39;s quite popular along the Colorado River.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Don&#39;t you need like special training, or do you just hop in the boat and go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  I think it depends on how difficult the river is, so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s beginner rivers, where you don&#39;t need so much training. Maybe a few hours. For that one that I did, with the waterfall, the lecture they gave us was about 25 minutes before we started.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What about your country? What about England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Not so many places to go white water rafting, because I don&#39;t think the rivers are big enough, or wide enough. There&#39;s some good places for canoeing, or kayaking. I know we have the national kayak center in Nottingham, England, which is pretty good. Yeah, but not so much for rafting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, thanks Mark.
