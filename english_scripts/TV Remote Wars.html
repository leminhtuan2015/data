 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 So Mark,
 <span class="audionotes">
  if you don&#39;t mind me asking
 </span>
 , how old are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m 31.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  31. OK, and so
  <span class="style12" onclick="MM_openBrWindow(&#39;../../Player0751/XPlayer.htm&#39;,&#39;&#39;,&#39;width=300,height=200&#39;)">
   you probably don&#39;t remember
  </span>
  but like... I&#39;m 37 and I remember watching television with no remote control. Like just the big square box you have to go up and turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I remember that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Was it the same when you were a kid?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. I think I actually had a TV like that up until about ten years ago when I was at a university student.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you just pressed on the button.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know actually, the remote control is so much more convenient but I actually miss having to
  <span class="audionotes">
   turn the knob
  </span>
  because you don&#39;t have so many choices. You know. Like, you pick a channel and you
  <span class="audionotes">
   stick with it
  </span>
  and then you watch it, but with the remote control you just want to flick, flick,
  <span class="audionotes">
   flick
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I call it flick-a-vision. Yeah. I quite like flick-a-vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what&#39;s flick-a-vision?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Well, just when you watch each channel for maybe a minute or two and then change, change, change, change. Yeah, I often do that. Like you say
  <span class="audionotes">
   you don&#39;t focus on the whole program
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. And it&#39;s terrible when you&#39;re sitting with somebody else and they have the remote control and they keep flicking away.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right, that causes a lot of family fights in my house. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, you are a newly married man, so do you have any remote control wars with your wife?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Recently no. Not at the moment because I am living in a very small house with a small room. It&#39;s quite easy to get up and turn over the TV without using the remote. But we&#39;re not fighting at the moment but I can see in the future we will be so the key there is probably to have two rooms with two TVs.

 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 OK, Mark, I thought we would talk about television. The theme this week will be TV.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  First of all, how much television do you watch a day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Per day? In Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Not so much because my Japanese is not so good so recently I&#39;ve been watching TV via the internet on a PC.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but if I for example have SKY TV, satellite TV maybe five or six hours per day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Whoa!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, especially news. I love watching news programs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so you watch five to six hours of television.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  If I am free. On a Saturday. One the weekends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A weekend type thing. And the thing you enjoy watching most is news?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  I like news programs also sports. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sports! What kinds of sports?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Any sports really, I watch on TV. Yeah, football, basketball, baseball, American football.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Here&#39;s a question, so you think it&#39;s better to watch sport on TV or to
  <span class="audionotes">
   watch it live
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Oh, definitely live.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, you think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but it&#39;s pretty expensive to watch live.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Definitely live.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   I don&#39;t know
  </span>
  .
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m kind of the other way
  </span>
  . Like, except for baseball, cause I&#39;m a huge baseball fan, but every other sport in America, basketball and American football, I think it&#39;s better to watch on TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Actually, I prefer both. So I go to the game and watch it live and then afterwards I can watch the replay on TV to look at the main place of the game. Obviously when you are watching it on TV you are a lot closer to the action.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Well, you have
  <span class="audionotes">
   the thrill of the crowd
  </span>
  and all of that, but especially like American football, there&#39;s so many close plays and this and that, plus American football is terrible to watch live because during the commercial breaks there is just nothing going on. You know? So
  <span class="audionotes">
   you are better off
  </span>
  being home and watching a commercial I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right. Yeah, and you can go for a beer or maybe a cup of tea at commercial. Actually, a few.. about a year ago I recently got contact lens because my eyes weren&#39;t so good, but when I was going to the football stadium, I couldn&#39;t see. You were so far away. But I didn&#39;t realize that my eyes were so bad. I thought they were just very far away until I got contact lens, and then suddenly I could see all the game. So that was a big improvement.
