  Christophe:
 </strong>
 Hey, Aiste,
 <span class="audionotes">
  I know you&#39;re not really into running, but
 </span>
 would you like join me running a marathon?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Join you running a marathon? What do you mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, next week I am going to run a marathon in Switzerland, so right now I&#39;m going alone all by myself. I have nobody to go with me,
  <span class="audionotes">
   <span class="audionotes">
    so I was thinking
   </span>
  </span>
  maybe you would like to go with me. Join me, so I&#39;m not alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Oh, next week, yes, we have a holiday and actually I was thinking I have no plans for this holiday. And Switzerland, that sounds like a wonderful country. How are we going to get there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I was thinking of
  </span>
  taking the train from Brussels, so we just take the train around eight o&#39;clock in the evening, and when we arrive there in the morning, we can have a nice sleep during the night on the train and, well, just next morning we are there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Oh, that sounds great. Definitely. Can you tell me more about the marathon? What type of marathon it is, and how are you planning to do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, it&#39;s a mountain marathon. It&#39;s quite interesting. It&#39;s not just like a flat marathon. It goes from 500 meter altitude to 2,300 meters altitude, so the finish is close to a glacier. It&#39;s really very impressive. I think you will like it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Oh, that sounds really difficult. Are you sure, you&#39;re prepared for that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, I prepared three months for this marathon.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I put a lot of work into it
  </span>
  . It was a lot of training, so I think I will be fine, but what about you? Will you run it too?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  No, no no no. NO way. I don&#39;t think I can run the marathon,
  <span class="audionotes">
   but I suppose
  </span>
  in Switzerland they should have some kind of elavator or funicular to get up the mountain. Can I see you reaching the glacier happy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, they organized some special trains for supporters of the runners, so if you join me, you can just buy a train ticket, jump on the train, and see me running while you are taking the train. It&#39;s a perfect combination or tourism and supporting me at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Oh, that sounds really great. Let&#39;s do that.
 </p>
