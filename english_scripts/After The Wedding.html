   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  So, since you&#39;ve been working so hard to plan this wedding, what are you worried about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  I suppose I&#39;m a little bit worried about the fact that we&#39;ve never lived together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  So once we get married, it will actually be the first time we&#39;ve lived together so before get married, we&#39;re going to have to find a place to live and buy all the things: all the
  <span class="audionotes">
   white goods
  </span>
  for our house. We have to buy the washing machine, the refrigerator and I&#39;m just worried there might be a little bit of stress probably for the first few months.

  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, getting used to living with each other. Is your fiance very clean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Hopefully, she&#39;s more clean than me cause I tend to leave things out
  <span class="audionotes">
   all over the place
  </span>
  , and I&#39;ve lived alone now for the last six years so I worry that I&#39;ve got into some
  <span class="audionotes">
   bad habits
  </span>
  , so I&#39;m going to have to be more considerate of her I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Right, that could be a conflict. I know when I first started living with my fiance, he never put... he never cleaned and it
  <span class="audionotes">
   drove me crazy
  </span>
  so he would always... for example he would leave his socks on the couch or he would leave his glass and wouldn&#39;t take it to the dishwasher, or he would eat food from take-out for example, and he would wrap up the baggage and then put it next to trash can, but not in the trash can, and it drove me crazy. I didn&#39;t understand why he couldn&#39;t clean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s just
  <span class="audionotes">
   a man thing
  </span>
  I think. I&#39;m completely with your fiance on that point. I like to not be completely clean because then I don&#39;t feel like I live there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Is there anything that you&#39;re really looking forward to?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m really looking forward to going on the honeymoon, together. I think that will be fantastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Where are you going?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  I haven&#39;t decided yet, but we&#39;re thinking maybe the Maldives.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Oh, right!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Or maybe going to Hawaii, so my fiance really likes to surf so he really wants to go somewhere he can surf but I really don&#39;t like to surf, but I like to go to the beach and read books, so as long as there&#39;s a beach somewhere, I think we&#39;ll be very happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  We were thinking of going somewhere completely different, for example Iceland.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Because my fiance found out that they have a wonderful, great big outdoor pool, with like hot water, volcanic hot water, so she&#39;s really excited to maybe to maybe go there. And also somewhere, where for the rest of your life, you&#39;re going, &#34;Where did you go for your honeymoon? Iceland!&#34; You know, it&#39;s somewhere a bit strange, so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Right. It&#39;s supposed to beautiful - Iceland, so it will be fun. So, you&#39;ll be in the cold and I&#39;ll be on the beach.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  And loving it, I&#39;m sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Exactly.
