   Tim:
  </strong>
  So, you know, we&#39;re talking a little bit about jobs. I&#39;m kind of curious. Do you prefer working in a group or do you prefer working alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a tough question.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  It definitely is because there is good things about both.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right, so I guess I&#39;m good at working by myself because I am self-motivated so if I am doing something I like and I can get it done quickly I like to do it by myself, but if I&#39;m working with a good team, a fun team, people who work hard and they all want to do a good job and get the job done well, then I think a team is fun, but you need guys, you need people, men and women, who work hard to do a good job so I prefer working in a team.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   understandable
  </span>
  . How about, do you prefer working and having a uniform or do you prefer
  <span class="audionotes">
   putting on
  </span>
  whatever you want to put on?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I think uniforms are pretty cool
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I think if you have a uniform too, sometimes you
  <span class="audionotes">
   get respect
  </span>
  . If you are are fireman or a policeman, you tend to get a bit of respect from the public but I wouldn&#39;t want a
  <span class="audionotes">
   cheesy uniform
  </span>
  with, you know, sort of like a strange hat or a funny looking bowtie. I wouldn&#39;t be into that, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Have you had any jobs with uniforms?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Any jobs with uniforms? No, I don&#39;t think I ever had. If you call a shirt and tie a uniform, then yeah, but no, no funny hats or bow ties or anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  So, how about a working schedule? Would you prefer working a flexible schedule with like
  <span class="audionotes">
   flex time
  </span>
  , or would you prefer
  <span class="style13">
   set hours
  </span>
  : come at this time, finish at this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Definitely, definitely flex hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah, why is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I think that a nine-to-five job is difficult to do. If you want to take some holidays, be with your family, or go on a vacation, or if the surfs up and it&#39;s a nice day you can go and just grab your board and go for surf but if you&#39;re on a nine-to-five job, you have no flexibility so definitely flex hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  So we are talking a little bit about hours. Do you prefer being paid by the hour or do you prefer a salary?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I think salary maybe is a better way to go because then if take holidays you get paid and if you&#39;re working paid by the hour, that style of work, you can&#39;t take anytime off because you know when you&#39;re not working, you&#39;re not getting paid so I think salary is a good way to go but as long as I&#39;m getting paid, I don&#39;t really mind which way it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s understandable.
