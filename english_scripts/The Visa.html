   So, was it difficult for him to get a visa or is it quite easy to go to New Zealand?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   They have a lot of things they want you to have before you can apply for the visa such as you need to prove that you&#39;re living together, certain things like that.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   Right, right, because his visa is under partnership. If he was going in under working then he would have to show that he had work in New Zealand, but since it&#39;s under partnership, and event hough it&#39;s a work visa, he doesn&#39;t need to have work in New Zealand as long as it&#39;s under partnership and he has to prove that he&#39;s been living with me for one year and that we have a

    Todd:

   Wow, how do you prove that you&#39;ve been living together? What kind of things do they do?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   We have to show a letter from the person that owns the apartment that we live in and we also have to show photos of us together from different times. We also have to have letters from friends. I think we had altogher maybe twenty letters from friends and family from both

   and basically saying that we&#39;ve been together for a certain amount of time and that they recommend the visa, etc, etc. Yeah, quite complicated.

    Lucinda:

   The paperwork&#39;s very easy. Apart from the house certificate we have to go and give them I think

    <a href="/NotesAudio0601/624-5-vials-blood.mp3">
     six vials of blood

   and get as many medical eximinations as you can think possible. Apart from that, the actual filling out of forms is very easy. There&#39;s only, I think, a number of pages, because there&#39;s no children involved or other people involved. It&#39;s only him and me so there&#39;s only a few pages actually to fill out on forms.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   He doesn&#39;t have any illnesses that New Zealand doesn&#39;t have or certain tests to see if he&#39;s fit, I guess. I don&#39;t know why they do that, but they like to know that someone doesn&#39;t have any too serious health problems, because once you go to New Zealand they have quite good health care system, so they don&#39;t want to be taking on some person that&#39;s just going to New Zealand for certain health care benefits.
