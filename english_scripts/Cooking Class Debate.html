   Fred:
  </strong>
  Hi, this is Fred from Canada and I&#39;m here with Tarta from Thailand. Some people think that cooking should be taught in school. I agree with that idea. I feel that definitely there should be some cooking classes in school. How do you feel about that, Tarta?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t think that cooking class is supposed to be teaching at school because I learn cooking from my mom and my grandma and it gives me lots of, you know, good relation between mom and daughter and it&#39;s kind of a family activity too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  OK, that&#39;s a good point, but you see, you know, a lot of mothers are working nowadays in
  <span class="audionotes">
   this new day and age
  </span>
  and so it&#39;s difficult for them to find time to teach their kids how to cook, and so what you&#39;re finding is more and more children have bad eating habits. They don&#39;t eat properly. They don&#39;t get the amount of vegetables per day that they should eat, or fruits or protiens
  <span class="audionotes">
   for that matter
  </span>
  , and so I feel that if there were cooking classes in school then that could also help the situation because it would make them have a better eating lifestyle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but why school? I mean, why you want to waste all the time studying cooking at school, not like instead of doing that, then you can learn all the top subjects like science, biology, chemistry and probably you&#39;re mom can&#39;t teach you all those complicated subjects, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a balance. I mean, you have so many hours of class per day. If you only took like one or two hours a week that would be enough for the kids to, you know, maybe find some interest into cooking, and then it would start from there. Then
  <span class="audionotes">
   it
  </span>
  would just
  <span class="audionotes">
   snowball
  </span>
  . Alright, like, they could start having some cooking classes, then, the children starts liking cooking this kind of thing, and then he goes back home, and he shares this new cooking recipe with his mom or his grandmother. Don&#39;t you think that would also bring the family closer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  OK, if you&#39;re supposed to cook at school, and then you have to buy all the ingredients, and those ingredients.... why you have to shop, you know? And some ingredients are already at your house and you just do your own cooking, but if you do at school then you have to go shopping outside and look for the ingredients from the textbook, and it&#39;s so complicated.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  I agree but, I mean that&#39;s just a slight problem isn&#39;t it. I mean, there&#39;s people working at the school that could be in charge of doing that and then once the class starts, well, all the ingredients are already on the table so there&#39;s no problem. They just start cooking, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  And one more thing. Like if you think about all the techniques, like family tastes and all, you can&#39;t find in cooking class at school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   you got me
  </span>
  there, Tarta. That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  OK, Fred, you better come to my house, and I will show you how to cook.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Really? OK, I
  <span class="audionotes">
   take your word
  </span>
  on that Tarta.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
