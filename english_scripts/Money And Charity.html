 <strong>
  Paul:
 </strong>
 Hi, this is Paul from England speaking with Katia from Mexico. First question is do you give money to charity?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Well, Paul, it&#39;s a difficult question because you really want to help people, but I always
  <span class="audionotes">
   question myself
  </span>
  where if the money really gets to where it&#39;s supposed to go, so personally I rarely do give money to charities. I&#39;d rather give my time, so I know if it&#39;s actually something happening. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess
  <span class="audionotes">
   that makes sense
  </span>
  . If it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a registered charity
  </span>
  then I don&#39;t see there&#39;s a problem really with giving a donation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess so, but really I wonder. There are so many charities in the world, and you wonder really how much money do the people actually get, so it&#39;s difficult to really know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  How about if you&#39;re walking down the street and you see a homeless person asking for money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Homeless people! That&#39;s also difficult because you can see they need money or they need food. Sometimes I feel if you give money, you are
  <span class="audionotes">
   supporting their way of life
  </span>
  so I would rather give some food so they can eat, but maybe if it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a disabled person
  </span>
  , I am more willing to give, rather than just the homeless.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;d agree with you. It&#39;s difficult to know what they&#39;re gonna use the money for, so usually I never give money to men but if it&#39;s like an elderly woman, I&#39;m happy to give a small donation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Why not men and only women?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Well, going back to what you said about supporting their way of life, I mean, not in every case, but I think that often it can just be man&#39;s choice to be homeless on the street and he does have a chance to get a job I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  So you think the woman really doesn&#39;t have a choice, and the man...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s more difficult for a woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Possibly. Possibly. That&#39;s a difficult question.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  For sure. Do you give money if you see children on the street?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Well, it depends, because that&#39;s also giving money to children so they can continue asking for money, so I avoid it. I also avoid it. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m a little bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   reluctant
  </span>
  to give money. I heard in a lot of poor countries that it can actually even be a business, like a parents will send their children onto the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Unfortunately, that&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  OK, so maybe you like what you said before: it&#39;s better to donate your time than to donate money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Possibly. And hopefully things will change.
