   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Leonard, now, when most people think of Kiwi, at least Americans, we think of the fruit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  Right, right. Also in Japan as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really! OK. But, uh, people from New Zealand are called Kiwis not because of the fruit I take it.
 </p>

   Leo:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right. The nickname for New Zealanders is Kiwi, and actually the Kiwi bird... Kiwi is actually a Maori name, and Maori are the native people of New Zealand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  And so Kiwi, the pronunciation of Kiwi K-I-W-I KEE-WEE, Maori has similar pronunciation to the Japanese language, ah, ee, uu, eh, oh. They pronounce the vowels.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. I&#39;m..what is Kiwi?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  A kiwi is a nocturnal bird, which only walks, it doesn&#39;t fly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So nocturnal means it only comes out at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  Right. Right. And in the deep forest. Actually, you&#39;d never see a Kiwi if you went to New Zealand, unless you went to the zoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  Right!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  And the brown Kiwi is the most, uh, rarest of them all. They&#39;re only I think, there are less than one thousand brown kiwis left.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. So..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  It can only be found in New Zealand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ok. OK. maybe I missed it but can it fly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  No, no it can&#39;t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It can&#39;t fly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  It can only walk.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, so it only comes out at night...in the deep forest and it can&#39;t fly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  You&#39;d be surprised. If you go to New Zealand, uh, there are over twenty different types of birds that walk.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really! That&#39;s fascinating. Well, thanks for telling us about the Kiwi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leo:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
