   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Simon, we&#39;re talking about the Olympics. Do you think the olympics still have their core meaning, or do you think the Olympics now are two
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/629-1-commercialized.mp3">
   commericalized
  </a>
  and two much
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/629-2-big-money.mp3">
   big money
  </a>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Well, I, you know, I would hate to
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/629-3-sit-on-the-fence.mp3">
   sit on the fence
  </a>
  on this one cause I am sitting on the fence but I think both. Yeah, it&#39;s far too corporate. It&#39;s way too corporate, too much media attention, too many sponsors, too much
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/629-4-corruption.mp3">
   corruption
  </a>
  , but I mean, I think you know, when you look at the athletes during the opening ceremony and you see the actual sports, that they&#39;re doing the same thing that they were many years ago and you can see the joy on their faces and even people who are not famous, you know having their time in the sun or in the snow in this case, you know, really enjoying it and being the best at what they do, so yeah. The answer is both.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, if you could change on thing to improve the olympics, what would you change?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  What would I change if I could improve the olympics? Well, I think, yeah, I would just change the influence that governments and sponsorship have and I&#39;d probably give the olympics a more
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/629-5-organic-feel.mp3">
   organic feel
  </a>
  , rather than, cause you know, the United States would get it every second or third time just because of all the corporate sponsorship and all the TV money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, right. Yeah, actually if I could change on thing, I think I would move some of the summer sports to the winter sports, like for example basketball. Like why can&#39;t they play basketball in the winter, or a lot of these indoor sports, the fact that their indoor, you don&#39;t have to do it because it&#39;s on ice or snow, and like you said earlier, then maybe you can get more countries involved
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Right. That&#39;s a good point actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, because does it have to be on snow or ice, but yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Well, a lot of sports, I can think of basketball, soccer, American football, they&#39;re all played in the winter time in most countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sure. Right. Right. So actually, the opympics are here. How much time do you think you&#39;ll spend watching the Olymics on TV?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Oh, probably about a couple of hours a week. Maybe three or four hours a week at most.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Yeah, I&#39;m going to try to catch the skiing. I like to watch the skiing and the hockey of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll watch but I&#39;ll just turn the TV on and find out how my country is, the players are doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, let&#39;s get the hockey schedule and go and watch some hockey down at the club.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  OK, let&#39;s do it.
