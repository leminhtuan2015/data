   Hey Tom, where&#39;ve you been lately?

   Oh, I&#39;ve been doing

    loads of
   </a>
   job interviews. You know I&#39;m graduating soon. I&#39;ve just got to work out what to do next. I&#39;m torn between a big company and a small company.

   Really? Personally I would choose the small company. What are you thinking?

   Well, see I was going to go with the big company because if it is bigger, it&#39;s got a bigger

   <a href="/NotesAudio0601/632-3-fold.mp3">
    to fold
   </a>
   in a couple of months. And also as a big company with a high profile they&#39;ve got to follow the laws. You know,
   <a href="/NotesAudio0601/632-4-toe-the-line.mp3">

   on looking after their employees. So things like pension and insurance are all going to be sorted out.

   <strong>
    Martin:
   </strong>
   Hmm. Well, I think a small company for almost all different reasons, it&#39;s a lot more exciting, you&#39;re gonna be treated, most importantly, like a person, not just a
   <a href="/NotesAudio0601/632-5-cog-in-wheel.mp3">
    cog in a wheel
   </a>
   and you know, you&#39;re young, you don&#39;t need to worry about you&#39;re pension just yet. You&#39;re not that old, you know, you can get by. And it would be nice to have the
   <br>
   relationships with your coworkers on like a human relationship instead of just one giant building and you&#39;re not feeling like a human there. And especially with your boss, I think that&#39;s always important to get the recognition that I think you deserve.

   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   I mean you&#39;ve got a good point about the personal relationships but that can also work against you I think. If someone who&#39;s not as good as you are has a good tight relationshiop with the boss then they&#39;re going to get the promotion and you&#39;re going to get passed over. That kind of closeness, that kind of family thing, that doesn&#39;t really seem fair.

   <strong>
    Martin:
   </strong>
   Well that is a good point but I think also if you look at a small company that most of the people working there are going to share a lot more of your ideals and you&#39;re gonna have a better time of integrating yourself in there and I think it&#39;s gonna be fairer by and large because it is smaller.

   I&#39;m gonna have to give this more thought.
