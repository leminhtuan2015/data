Eleven people were killed and six others injured Friday when a disgruntled Virginia Beach city employee opened fire at one of the city's municipal buildings.
<br><br>
Police chief James Cervera said the suspect who was killed in a gunfight with police officers opened fire indiscriminately at workers inside an operations building.
<br><br>
"Shortly after 4 p.m. this afternoon, the suspect entered a building two.  He's a longtime employee of public utilities.  I will not release his name at this time and he immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all the victims."
<br><br>
The six injured have been transported to local hospitals.
<br><br>
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam called it a horrible day for the Commonwealth.
<br><br>
"Our thoughts are for these victims and their families. And we're working with our law enforcement, first responders, our folks at the hospital and just making sure we take care of everybody right now."
<br><br>
Virginia Senator and former vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said he was devastated to hear about the incident, writing on Twitter "My heart is with everyone who host a loved one and I'm praying for a swift recovery for all the injured."

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sought to raise the pressure on U.S. ally Germany Friday over next generation networks that use technology from the Chinese company, Huawei.
<br><br>
Speaking after meeting with Germany's foreign minister in Berlin, Pompeo said each country will have to decide what technology to use but that decision will have consequences.
<br><br>
"... risk that we will have to change our behavior in light of the fact that we can't permit private citizen data from the United States or national security data from the United States to go across networks that we don't have confidence, that we don't view as trusted networks." 
<br><br>
The United States contends that some Huawei's technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government.
<br><br>
Later, Pompeo met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel for brief talks before flying to Switzerland.

Officials in Afghanistan say a suicide bomb attack Friday targeted a foreign military convoy in Kabul, killing at least four Afghan civilians and wounding four American soldiers.
<br><br>
The U.S. military confirmed the attack and said the service members received "minor injuries."

The Taliban took responsibility for the bombing on a busy road linking Kabul to the eastern city of Jalalabad, saying a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-packed car near the foreign military convoy.

A judge has ruled that the only clinic that performs abortions in the U.S. state of Missouri can remain open for now.
<br><br>
AP's Ed Donahue reports.
<br><br>
Missouri Governor Mike Parson said in a statement state regulators still have "serious health and safety concerns regarding Planned Parenthood's facility in St. Louis."
<br><br>
The state health department refused to renew the clinic's license.
<br><br>
Outside the clinic: "Our abortion rights are ...."
<br><br>
"Today is a huge victory for the people of Missouri."
<br><br>
Doctor David Eisenberg is the clinic's medical director.
<br><br>
"This is a political game being paid by the patients we take care.  The people in power are not paying the price for this."
<br><br>
The clinic's license will remain in effect until a ruling is issued on Planned Parenthood's request for a permanent injunction.

June 1 marks the beginning of the hurricane season in the United States and the National Hurricane Center is predicting between 9 and 15 named storms in the six-month season.
<br><br>
The center says that 4 to 8 of those storms could become hurricanes with 2 or 4 of them becoming major ones with winds in excess of 179 kilometers per hours.
<br><br>
Neil Jacobs is with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
<br><br>
"The information that we are getting through the forecast models is increasingly accurate and when they issue watches and warnings that's the time to take action, but the time to prepare is now."
<br><br>
The hurricane season runs until November 30.
