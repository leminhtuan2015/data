   Nick:
  </strong>
  In Australia, there’s a lot of snakes as well. Is there snakes in Guam?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there’s plenty of snakes in Guam, one of which is very famous. It’s the brown tree snake. Now the brown tree snake was brought over to Guam a long time ago in cargo ships when it hid in the cargo and the cargo was unloaded onto the docks of Guam. So when these brown tree snakes were
  <span class="audionotes">
   accidentally
  </span>
  released onto Guam’s soil, they
  <span class="audionotes">
   subsequently
  </span>
  destroyed most of Guam’s bird population. Can you believe that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  That’s amazing. Yeah. Introductions like that can cause disasters for wildlife.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, exactly. And because these brown tree snakes destroyed most of the bird life on Guam we’ve lost a lot of beautiful tropical birds that used to live on Guam. Another thing that I can think of that was introduced to Guam, but isn’t a wild animal, is a wild plant and we call it a Japanese Bonsai Leaf, actually. And I believe Bonsai means suicide or something in Japanese but what these leaves do is they grow and grow and they look like vines so they cover loads and loads of trees and good wildlife that are out there. I mean, plant life and they keep these plant life from growing because they
  <span class="audionotes">
   essentially
  </span>
  ambush them and keep sunlight from
  <span class="audionotes">
   ever
  </span>
  reaching them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  That’s really interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so if you can imagine a building covered
  <span class="audionotes">
   completely
  </span>
  in really thick vine, that’s how these Japanese Bonsai leaves work. They completely shroud and cover all of the good plant life that we have on Guam. So we’ve lost a lot of good plant life, beautiful different types of leaves, and bushes, flowers. So in addition to losing all of our bird life, we’ve also lost a lot of our plant life to this introduction of a foreign plant species in Guam.
