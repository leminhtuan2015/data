  Todd:
 </strong>
 Mike, you&#39;re giving tips about weight training and we&#39;ve talked about upper body. Now what about lower body and legs? I actually don&#39;t want to lift weights with my legs. I just... It is OK if I just
 <span class="audionotes">
  skip it
 </span>
 ?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, you should do your legs because you should get a
  <span class="audionotes">
   full body workout
  </span>
  because if you just do one part of your body it affect the other parts of your body as well, so you need to be balanced.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so I&#39;m convinced. I&#39;m gonna work on my legs. What&#39;s the most basic exercise I should do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  I think you should start off squatting. That&#39;s where you put... make sure you have a squat rack, and you put the bar behind your head on your shoulders and you just squat as if you are sitting on a bench and come back up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now often I see guys in the gym that do that. They have the big weight belt. Do I need to get a weight belt?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  It would be good, that if you&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   just starting off
  </span>
  to use the weight belt but once you
  <span class="audionotes">
   get the motion
  </span>
  I would advise you to to not use the weight belt so that it forces you to keep
  <span class="audionotes">
   good posture
  </span>
  yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, when you do the squat, like how low should I go. Should I go until I&#39;m almost sitting on the floor?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  As is there was a bench underneath your.....
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Bottom?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Yeah, right. So basically, your legs and your knees should be about 90 degrees.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so that&#39;s... that will work out all my legs? That&#39;s all I have to do is squats?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s probably the best one you can do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and that is for my calves and my hamstrings too?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Not your calves but for your hamstrings and your bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So what should I do for my calves?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  You can do calf raises, which is... you can do it on a squat rack, and you just hold the bar in the same position as you would a squat and just raise your legs up on your toes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so in terms of how... of sets, like how many sets should I do of the squats?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  I think you should start of with three sets.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Three sets.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  The same as the other exercises.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And about ten reps?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  And about ten reps, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So do I always keep the weight constant? I don&#39;t have the weight go up or down?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, once you get used to the motion and the position that you&#39;re in, then you can start increasing the weights as you go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, but I mean, each set should be the same weight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, when you&#39;re starting off.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, yeah. And also just for the calves, just do three sets?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yep, just do three sets.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Alright.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, thanks a lot, Mike. I&#39;m gonna get started.
