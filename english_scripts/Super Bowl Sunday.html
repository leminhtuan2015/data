  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Melissa, the Super Bowl is coming up. And what do you think about football?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s really interesting. This Japanese guy recently told me it was the most interesting sport to watch because of
  <span class="audionotes">
   the rules
  </span>
  , but unfortunately I don&#39;t really know the rules so I have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   hard time following
  </span>
  it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But you&#39;re American. You don&#39;t like American football?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m more of a basketball fan cause when I watch it, I can easily understand
  <span class="audionotes">
   what&#39;s going on
  </span>
  , and when I&#39;m watching football, everyone around me just screams and they don&#39;t really tell me what&#39;s going on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. But the Super Bowl - that&#39;s like the biggest game of the year right! So you go to Super Bowl parties, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah, my sister&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   crazy about
  </span>
  football and she has Super Bowl parties but I haven&#39;t really lived in America for the past three years, and before that I was in college and I never really went to one. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, I&#39;m huge .... it&#39;s the biggest day of the year for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s your favorite team?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, my team is terrible now ... the 49ers, so they&#39;re never, ever in the Super Bowl.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s cool. San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But the thing I think is great about Super Bowl Sunday is it&#39;s really ... it&#39;s like the silent American holiday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know what I mean? Like it&#39;s the one day where everybody gets together and watches the game and has a good time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m from Philadelphia and Philadelphia fans of all sports are totally wild and crazy, and they just go all out, so a lot of my family members and friends go crazy about the Eagles&#39; games.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So have you ever been to a professional game?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  I haven&#39;t. I haven&#39;t been to a professional football game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, what about college? Did you have a big college team?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t think so. We had a good basketball team at the University of Arizona - The Wildcats, but ....
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Football, I don&#39;t really recall having a good football team.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So when you watch the Super Bowl, usually the best part is the commercials, right? So, they have the commercials, so you watch those, don&#39;t you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  To be honest, I can&#39;t remember watching the Super Bowl in recent years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Here it is. I&#39;m saying it&#39;s the biggest day of the year, and you don&#39;t remember ever seeing it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  I mean, I remember watching it, but they&#39;re just ... I remember like
  <span class="audionotes">
   being more into
  </span>
  the food that was all around me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, right. Fair enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Sorry. But if you invite me this year I&#39;ll come.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool.
 </p>
