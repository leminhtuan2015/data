  Jana:
 </strong>
 So Peter, you also learned English as a foreign language, right?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not your first language? So how did you do it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a good question. When I think back, I think, I try to think about the things that helped me most and I think it was a funny combination of things. I had one really interesting English teacher, she was really strict, but she was really interesting and I think she inspired me
  <span class="audionotes">
   in some ways
  </span>
  because her English was so good and I thought &#39;wow&#39; that&#39;s really great. I
  <span class="audionotes">
   wouldn&#39;t mind
  </span>
  being able to be as good as her. The other thing that really helped me was reading like I really read so much in English. I think you mentioned, I remember you saying that too at some other point.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think so too. I read a lot, not because I wanted to learn but because I like reading and so I read in English and later on I realized I must have learned a lot of vocabulary and things that I didn&#39;t even realize I learned.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  I think yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Just through reading.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the same thing happened to me. My home had so many books in it, I was lucky I guess in that way and at least half of them were in English and when I discovered that there were books in the house that I couldn&#39;t get into and I was really into stories and reading, I felt so angry that I couldn&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   get into
  </span>
  them so I said OK I&#39;ll start try and read them and I guess it started off there because then I started reading so much and it was really good for me in the end, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  So that was your motivation, you wanted to read those mysterious books?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Yes and it was really good for me that way I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s interesting. You see people ask me how did I learn English. I didn&#39;t really have a plan, I just enjoyed English that&#39;s why I studied in my free time but I didn&#39;t think of it as something I have to do, I just did it for fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  I think so too for me. Also in high school I remember my classmates complaining about all the homework in English and they couldn&#39;t do it and they used to come to me for help and then I thought but hang on it&#39;s not, it doesn&#39;t feel like work to me, it just feels like something kind of fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  But I can&#39;t tell you where that fun started. I guess it has something to do with being curious about things that are written or said. Do you think so?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I also sort of remember when I first became interested in English but later on when I met some people from different countries, I became more interested in communicating with them and, like you said, my teacher also inspired me. I enjoyed just chatting to her in English.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was basically fun. It was not studying hard for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I suppose it&#39;s the same for me I think. I think when I got to university and I could read and write and my listening was really good in English but I couldn&#39;t speak so well at all and then I happened to make some English friends and they
  <span class="audionotes">
   couldn&#39;t speak a word of
  </span>
  Afrikaans or any other language so I was kind of forced to communicate with them in English and that, I think that really helped me too because I was forced in a way to be able to
  <span class="audionotes">
   speak my mind
  </span>
  and in the way that they could only understand so you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Right, that really makes it meaningful doesn&#39;t it? You really need to, you want to express yourself so you have to try hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and I remember this frustration. They would have these arguments about things that I was interested in and I wanted to join but I couldn&#39;t and so I just decided well I have to just do this. I want to talk so I&#39;d better do it in English.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. Yeah, I think I improved a lot by talking to people from different countries, not necessarily native speakers but having friends from different countries and I wanted to communicate with them so, yeah, you just do it and you learn as you go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think so too.
