   Todd
  </strong>
  : So, have you had any other jobs you didn&#39;t like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : Well, I trained to be a chef when I left school, and I&#39;ve had a lot of jobs actually over the years in different restaurants, and some of them I didn&#39;t like at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What was it about the job you didn&#39;t like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : I didn&#39;t like the people I was working with a lot of the time, so I worked with some very aggressive chefs, and some people who weren&#39;t very good at communicating their ideas to me, I felt, and so I found some jobs difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : not a lot of fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that would be no fun at all. I think on of the worst jobs I ever had was a part-time job, and it was only one night only, and it was on Valentines Day, and I had to walk around and try to sell roses to people on Valentine&#39;s Day, and I was like sixteen years old, and I couldn&#39;t get anybody to buy the roses, and I would go up and every one thought I was really
  <span class="audionotes">
   cheesy
  </span>
  for approaching them to try and buy a rose, but the person who hired me said I had to get rid of all the roses by the end of the night, so it was just a miserable, miserable night, and I think I got most of them sold, and at the end of the night, I just paid the eight
  <span class="audionotes">
   bucks
  </span>
  or whatever
  <span class="audionotes">
   out of my own pocket
  </span>
  and just paid for it myself
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : So tell me, did you have more luck selling the flowers to guys or two women?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, definitely only the guys bought the roses. The women didn&#39;t, but was really awkward is you would
  <span class="audionotes">
   go up
  </span>
  and try to sell the rose, and the guy didn&#39;t want to buy the rose, and then the woman doesn&#39;t want you there because it makes the guy
  <span class="audionotes">
   look awkward
  </span>
  , so it was a bad day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica
  </strong>
  : So was it easier approaching guys by themselves?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : A little bit. Sometimes guys walking down the street would see up and they would be thankful, cause they would think, &#34; Oh, I get a rose&#34; you know, like &#34;I almost forgot&#34;. Actually it was really hard to sell them and it was just a very long night.
