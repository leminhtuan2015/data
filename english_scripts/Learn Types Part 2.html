 <strong>
  Julia:
 </strong>
 And how about you? What kind of learner are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well I guess I&#39;m maybe kinesthetic, that&#39;s movement, right, or doing things with your hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think so or even your whole body?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. Is kinesthetic using your hands or is it your whole body? Or does it matter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m not sure it matters. Perhaps there&#39;s two different types. I know there&#39;s something called TPR when we teach English, total physical response.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. So that would be
  <span class="audionotes">
   kinesthetic
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s maybe kinesthetic, that&#39;s where you give an instruction and the student performs the task and they use the whole body in that case but it can just be your hands or a body part. I think it&#39;s both.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yes, I think so, yeah. Yes, I mean, so basically if I do it like if I somehow have to make it or if I&#39;m moving, I definitely think I learn better. You know, I learned how to do everything for web design and stuff like that by I think just moving the mouse, click here, click there, type here, type there,
  <span class="audionotes">
   whereas
  </span>
  like reading it from a book I just, you know, I couldn&#39;t learn it that way. So maybe, maybe, I&#39;m kind of that way. The same with cooking, you know, like I have to do it. If I don&#39;t do it I&#39;m not going to remember it. I just can&#39;t read a recipe and cook. So I think maybe the other thing I would be, would be, I guess would be an aural learner or
  <span class="audionotes">
   auditory
  </span>
  <span class="audionotes">
   learner
  </span>
  . So basically through hearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  My husband&#39;s the same, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  He can hear a sentence, hear a new word, and remember it just from his ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s very good, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like I love podcasts and I love hearing things, that&#39;s probably why I have this website. I don&#39;t like reading too much. I do read and I actually don&#39;t even like watching TV very much. I don&#39;t like watching movies very much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No. I would actually much rather listen to a radio program, a good podcast, than watch a movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You see when I listen to a podcast...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  While I&#39;m walking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  There you go, definitely kinesthetic. If I listen to a podcast, I get a little bit frustrated that I can&#39;t see the people speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  It frustrates me a little bit that I can&#39;t see the faces when they&#39;re talking, when I don&#39;t know what they look like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I never even thought of that. Yeah, I just don&#39;t even care.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I need to, I need
  <span class="audionotes">
   visual
  </span>
  <span class="audionotes">
   input
  </span>
  in order for it to, I don&#39;t know, go into that part of my brain where it stays, where it
  <span class="audionotes">
   stores
  </span>
  maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So we&#39;re definitely two different types of learners?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Absolutely, yes.
