   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hello, Jason. You&#39;re from England. Uh, where are you from in England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from South London.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool. South London. Why don&#39;t you talk about that for awhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  OK, well, London is a little bit colder that Japan, it&#39;s a little bit more expensive as well, so it is kind of nice to come here and spend my money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So actually, you said South London right? Is that where Wimbleton is? South London?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Wimbleton, No! Wimbleton&#39;s in West London.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  West London!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Yeah. South London isn&#39;t
  <span class="audiodef">
   famous
  </span>
  for much, really,
  <span class="audiodef">
   apart from
  </span>
  rude people like me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what&#39;s the difference between South London and West London and North London?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there is a big difference between all the places in London. Everyone&#39;s got different
  <span class="audiodef">
   accents
  </span>
  . Everyone
  <span class="audiodef">
   acts
  </span>
  differently. England has a lot of different places. For example, in North England they&#39;ll have different accents, completely different accents, from South England and sometimes even different languages, like in Wales and Scotland, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So your accent is South London.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  My accent is South London, yeah. Someone from North London would sound completely different from me, and West London and so on, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So is South London the best place to live?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, of course. Actually, Central London would be but it is way too expensive, kind of like Tokyo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Were you born in South London?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I was born in South London. Yeah. But, you know, I&#39;ve been everywhere in England, so and
  <span class="audiodef">
   believe me
  </span>
  there&#39;s a lot of different places, everywhere is different, so .
