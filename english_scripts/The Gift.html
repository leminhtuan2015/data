   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Now, Anna, you were telling a cute story about a special gift you gave your husband.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anna:
  </strong>
  Yes. Well, our first Valentine&#39;s day, I wanted to give John a very unique gift, so
  <strong>
  </strong>
  I remembered that he used to have an iguana, so I thought he liked reptiles, and I found a cute Pac Man Frog at the pet store, and actually one of my students told me about Pac Man Frogs and I thought, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s so cute!&#34; and so I bought the frog for John and I surprised him with it, and I made him close his eyes and I brought the frog out and the look on John&#39;s face was so funny. He was so terrified because he didn&#39;t like reptiles. I was wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, no!
 </p>

   </a>
   Anna:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so he
  <strong>
  </strong>
  had to keep the frog for maybe one year. And he didn&#39;t like it. He thought it smelled bad, and the worst thing was the frog had to eat baby mice, so once a week John had to go to the pet store and buy a baby mouse and feed it to the frog, so!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! The frog ate mice?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anna:
  </strong>
  Yeah, once a week, it ate a mouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How much did it weigh?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anna:
  </strong>
  Maybe 8 ounces. I don&#39;t know. It was big. It could sit in your hand. It was the same size as your hand. Yeah, it was really big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s a cool story. A Pac Man frog.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anna:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Pac Man, cause it looks like the Pac Man character.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  John, can you talk a little bit about the frog that you got for your Valentine&#39;s day gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Sure, yeah, my wife gave me this Pac Man frog for Valentine&#39;s day, and basically it was this enormous, stinky frog that would only eat baby mice, so you had to like feed it like a little tiny cute baby mouse like every week and then it would just like leave this big mess, this stinky mess, and you&#39;d have to clean it up and at the time I had just gotten rid of an iguana, and like I didn&#39;t want any pets and that was the gift my wife gave me so!

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, man, well, how long did you have it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  I think I kept it for about six month. Maybe even a year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Well see, I kept it until she moved in with me and then when she moved in with me, she said, &#34;Wow, that thing really stinks!&#34; We should get rid of it.&#34; So we took it back to the pet store and just gave it back to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, so you took it back to the pet store. They took it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Yeah, they took it. I looked around for someone to like give it to, and everyone was like, &#34;No, that thing is disgusting. No one wanted it and I asked the pet store would they like pay for it, and they were like &#34;No, no, you bought it&#34; so I was just like, &#34;Here, OK, have it back&#34; and they were &#34;Fine, we&#39;ll sell it again&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, do you ever know what happened to the frog?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  No, maybe, I went back to that pet store like a year after I gave it back to them and it was still there and it was like twice the size, so I don&#39;t know if they ever got rid of it or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Great story.

   Well, I got up quite early this morning, actually, to go shopping.

   That&#39;s true but you&#39;re on a budget. You&#39;re trying to save money.

   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, it was quite difficult to find something that I thought he would like, but I got him some cakes in the end, some Japanese cakes.

   Japanese cakes?

   Yeah, they&#39;re in like a special presentation box.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   So, how are you going to get the cakes to your brother? Just through the post office?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes, I sent them in the post this morning.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, did you send them express or just regular mail?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   No, regular mail because it was cheaper.

 </p>
 <p>

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   But, don&#39;t you want it to hurry and get there for his birthday?

   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   I&#39;ve got one week. I think it will get there in time.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So, what do you think you&#39;re brother will think of the cakes?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll like them actually.

   <strong>
    Todd:

   No?

   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, he likes chocolate cake, and they look like they&#39;ve got kind of chocolate inside but it&#39;s bean paste. I think he&#39;ll be disappointed.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So what did you brother get you for your last birthday?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s a good question. He always gives me money, and he often gives me chocolate as well. He&#39;s very generous.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Actually, I&#39;m the same way. Guys like to give money. Money is so easy. No shopping involved.

 </p>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   It&#39;s practical, though, it&#39;s good.

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Now, I&#39;ve been told that when you give money for a gift, it&#39;s actually very impolite.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Really?
  </font>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Is that true? Yeah!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Why is that?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   I don&#39;t know. Some people say it&#39;s just really impersonal. That you should take the time to get a gift.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Really! I really think if anybody gave me money I would be so pleased. It&#39;s a good present.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Exactly, that&#39;s what I think. (Pause) Hey, um, actually, when are you going to see your brother next?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Probably, I will see him in August of September.
