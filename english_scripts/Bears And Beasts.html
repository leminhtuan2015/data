  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Asako we&#39;re talking about Alaska. Now, in Alaska, obviously there&#39;s lots of wilderness. Some people say it&#39;s the most wild area left in the word. Did you get a chance to go camping or hiking?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah. Camping almost every single weekend.
  <span class="audionotes">
   That&#39;s a joke
  </span>
  , but... Yeah, many times. I camped and of course people enjoy hiking, rock climbing. If you&#39;re not really
  <span class="audionotes">
   an outdoor type
  </span>
  , you can enjoy barbecuing, but yeah, some people do enjoy outdoor.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, you know, Alaska is really famous for bears, so when you would go hiking or camping would ever see any bears?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Seriously?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Of course. Wolves. Bears.
  <span class="audionotes">
   You can name it
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Bears. Wolves.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And people still go out there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but aren&#39;t you afraid of the bears?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Well, you have to know what you are supposed to do, but yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, what do you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Well, you have to be careful about what you would do with your food. You know. You don&#39;t put your
  <span class="audionotes">
   leftovers
  </span>
  anywhere you like. You have to be really careful with that, and also you have to know how you are supposed to act when you actually meet a bear when you are hiking, but if you have the right knowledge, you should be OK. Of course, still there are accidents but you should be OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! So what do you they tell you to do if you see a bear?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Well, you&#39;re supposed to wave your hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wave your hands. Up high?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Up high.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you seem taller?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  You seem taller and also bears have never seen animals doing stuff like that, so they get scared and leave. That&#39;s usually but when bears are really hungry, then you still, yeah, so there are bears that are really hungry and maybe look crazy, so you&#39;re still
  <span class="audionotes">
   taking a chance
  </span>
  , but.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, what about a wolf? Or wolves? Do you do the same thing for wolves?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, the only wolves I&#39;ve seen was in the Denaly Park. I was in a car, so i didn&#39;t have any problems, so I really don&#39;t know what I am supposed to do when I meet wolves.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now for the local people, what do they consider more dangerous, a wolf or a bear?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  You don&#39;t see many wolves, but you do see a lot of bears so maybe bears.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah. Well, they both sound scary to me.
