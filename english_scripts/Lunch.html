   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Hi, Cat, that looks like a lovely salad you got there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  Thanks it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  What has it got in it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  Um, I cheated and I bought one of those pre-packaged lettuce with herbs and some leftover food from last night, but it&#39;s good. It&#39;s got some couscous and vegetables, some grilled veggies, and then salad and olive oil and vinegar for dressing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Ah, so you&#39;re a bit of a cook or, I don&#39;t know, you enjoy preparing food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess so. I wouldn&#39;t call myself a cook but I enjoy eating well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  OK, so do you go out much to eat, or do you kind of stay at home, or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  I can&#39;t afford it right now, but I wouldn&#39;t mind going out every now and then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Let&#39;s say if you had a $100 now, and you could go to any restaurant,
  <br>
  anywhere in the world, where would you go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  I would go for very expensive sushi. I think. Something good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  And anything else? What about for dessert?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  Oh, I don&#39;t know. One of those fancy restaurants and buy a $20 dessert or something like that, if there is such a thing. I don&#39;t even know. Creme brulee. That&#39;s one of my favorites.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Creme brulee! What&#39;s creme brulee?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  We&#39;ll have to ask one of our French friends for that one. What&#39;s that mean? Cream? Creme brulee. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s good though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Is it ice-creamy or creamy or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s got, um, what is it? It&#39;s that dish. It&#39;s a custard, with a, they put the heat. A hot, like a flare gun. What is it? It&#39;s a heat gun over the custard and it makes the sugar harden and then on the inside it&#39;s all custard. If that makes sense. It&#39;s really good. It&#39;s nice, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  It sounds really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Oh, so you&#39;ll have to meet yourself a Frenchman and get him in the kitchen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ll have to find one in the kitchen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Well, good luck. Thanks for talking to us.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cat:
  </strong>
  Yeah! See you next time.
