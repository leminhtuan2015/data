  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : How about you? Have you ever been in an accident?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Not a car accident. I was in a bicycle accident.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Yeah?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : I laugh now but at the time, it was pretty bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : What happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : It was dark and it was Christmas day. And I was on my bicycle going down a quite steep slope and my telephone rang. And I looked at my mobile phone and I took it out of my pocket whilst riding my bike. And looked at it and noticed it was my dad and he was ringing to wish me a happy Christmas.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I felt sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   compelled
  </span>
  to answer the phone. So answering the phone, still going down the hill, probably gathering speed. It&#39;s dark and I&#39;m trying to get my dad off the phone as soon as I can. And before I knew it, I drove straight into the back of a parked black car.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Oh no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : I saw it at the very last minute. So I hit the back of it and my body slammed into the ground, and I broke a few bones, yeah. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Oh no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah, yeah. It was a pretty miserable Christmas to be honest with you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : I&#39;d say it&#39;s terrible. That&#39;s the worst.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Did the owner of the car see what happened? Did you damage the car?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : I didn&#39;t stay long enough. I got out of there pretty quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : And went to the hospital.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : No, I was a bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   stubborn
  </span>
  . I don&#39;t know why. I was the worst night sleep I&#39;ve ever had but yeah, I didn&#39;t go to the hospital until the next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : What bones did you break?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : I broke my collarbone, the clavicle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Oh, a nightmare.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : And I broke a few ribs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Oh no, ribs. That&#39;s the worst because they can&#39;t do anything for it. They just
  <span class="audionotes">
   send you on your way
  </span>
  and you just have to cough in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Oh no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah. But it could have been a lot worse, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Hmm, that&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I could have broken my neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : So how long did it take you to recover?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : It took me about probably six weeks, I suppose.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah, because then—actually, in the following —it happened on Christmas day, so three months later in the March, I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   lucky enough
  </span>
  to win a place in the Tokyo marathon. And I really wanted to do it because it&#39;s quite difficult to get. It&#39;s like a lottery now. There&#39;s so many people who apply to get a position.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I wasn&#39;t going to let this accident stop me from running the Tokyo marathon. So I was trying to rush it, really and I shouldn&#39;t have. But I did. I&#39;ve run there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Did you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Oh, my goodness.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I finished it but—
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Congratulations. But how were you? That must have really
  <span class="audionotes">
   hindered
  </span>
  your recovery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : It hindered my training period for the marathon, yeah, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : But you finished it though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : I finished it, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Well done.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : I wouldn&#39;t do it again. Marathons are miserable things to be. Really. Why put yourselves through that pain? I still like running so maybe in the future, I&#39;d do a half marathon or something, yeah. But a full marathon—my marathon days are over, I think. Yeah.
