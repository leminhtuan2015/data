  Olga:
 </strong>
 So I really want to try chicha.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  You should.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Is it like wine? I heard like wine in Chile is really good, so is it any similarity to it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s a bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   lighter
  </span>
  than wine. You don&#39;t get the color of red wine. It&#39;s not as strong as red wine but it also is much nicer because it&#39;s sweet and it tastes more like juice but it has alcohol in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Then it should be a really
  <span class="audionotes">
   young like wine
  </span>
  right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yes it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see. And, you know, how many
  <span class="audionotes">
   degrees of alcohol
  </span>
  does it have? Is it really like strong?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think, we haven&#39;t measured it because it&#39;s really, we don&#39;t produce it in any companies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see. It&#39;s like a nice traditional drink?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a traditional drink but it&#39;s pretty much, it&#39;s really similar to wine. It&#39;s not that stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  And do, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   housewives
  </span>
  in Chile make it like in their own house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yes, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Oh cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  You can actually go to some places. There are some famous places you can go and you can see how they make it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Is it really a hard process?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve heard it is so if you don&#39;t know how to do it, it will just stay as juice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  And I guess they don&#39;t sell it in Santiago, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  No we don&#39;t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Only, you know, in the
  <span class="audionotes">
   countryside
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  You have to go to the countryside, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see. Well I would like to taste it so get it for me next time, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  You have to come to Chile and get it
  <span class="audionotes">
   for yourself
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  OK, I will.
