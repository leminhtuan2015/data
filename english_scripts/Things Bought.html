  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so Shona, what did you do this morning?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  This morning? So far today, I went to the supermarket and bought some muesli. Had my breakfast, which was the first muesli I&#39;ve had in a few weeks, so I was quite enjoying that, and then I went to Ikea of all places and
  <span class="audionotes">
   done a spot
  </span>
  of shopping and bought like really cool cushion with embroidered birds on it, and then I went for  a jog like just recently, and I&#39;ve been cleaning my room also.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, pretty busy day. So let&#39;s go back to the muesli. Now for people that don&#39;t know muesli, what is muesli?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Muesli consists of pieces of oat and dried fruits and also like flakes of corn and it&#39;s just a bit of mixture of these things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, you eat it with milk?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you have it with milk, or some
  <span class="audionotes">
   people who are a bit crazy
  </span>
  have it with orange juice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Get out of here. Seriously?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  No, they do, yeah, orange juice. Orange juice in their muesli.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is that like for
  <span class="audionotes">
   vegetarians and vegans
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  No, I think it&#39;s just people enjoy the taste of orange juice and muesli. Or maybe they&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   allergic to milk
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, could be. Could be. Actually, you said you went to a furniture store.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there is like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a big one
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, so what did you buy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  I bought a massive cushion, pillow thing, which is all embroidered. It&#39;s very cute and I also bought, like a bed cover for my bed. It&#39;s orange, and I was looking for some ferry lights actually, but they didn&#39;t seem to have any so I was a bit disappointed by that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sorry. What?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Ferry lights.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know what that is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s like a really long strand of wire and it&#39;s just got lots of tiny lights of it, like randomly, so you&#39;ve have saw them like Christmas tree lights.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  You have them on your Christmas tree. I kind of like them. I just like them in my room.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s pretty cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah. And also some, cause they have like Swedish food there, so I bought some crisp bread as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool. This is Ikea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Mm-hm.  Ikea.
