   Todd:
  </strong>
  Gloria, what are your plans for the summer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m going to Thailand for two weeks and then I&#39;m going to England for three weeks and then
  <br>
  back to the US.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK , wait, Thailand, you&#39;re going to Thailand?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what are the plans for Thailand?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m going with a friend of mine, Adrienne and we&#39;re going to go to the Bridge over the River Kwai and then we&#39;re going to go to the beaches and I hope to take a scuba diving course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so you&#39;ve never been Scuba diving before.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;ve only been snorkeling
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, actually, you know what, I got trained in scuba diving in Thailand in Ko Tao.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  Ah, that&#39;s where I&#39;m going.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  Oh, it&#39;s really good. It&#39;s pretty cheap too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, I got the brochures from that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, great. So who is this Adrienne person?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  She&#39;s another teacher, that for two semesters we lived, one semester next door, and another semester she lived upstairs from me and we&#39;ve just become really, really good friends and then this semester even thought we&#39;re not living near each other, somehow we still remained being friends and we love to go to flea markets and buy cheap kimono
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cheap kimonos?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we&#39;ll spend 500 or 1,000 yen maximum and find used antique flea market kimono.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool, how many have you bought so far?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gloria:
  </strong>
  Dozens, probably
