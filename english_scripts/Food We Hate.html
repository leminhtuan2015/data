  : So what are three foods you
  <span class="audionotes">
   can&#39;t stand
  </span>
  ?
                                          Three foods that you hate?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Number one would be chocolate.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Chocolate?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : That&#39;s crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : I don&#39;t like the feeling you have when
                                          you put a piece of chocolate inside your mouth. It&#39;s
                                          like too hot. Like if I eat a piece of chocolate, I need
                                          to drink a lot of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : It feels – I don&#39;t like it. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : I will gladly eat all your chocolate. If
                                          you have chocolate you don&#39;t want, I&#39;m here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   weird because
  </span>
  when, you know,
                                          chocolate is very popular as a gift. Somebody is always
                                          giving you chocolate and I take it because I don&#39;t want
                                          to say to everybody like, &#34;I hate chocolate actually.&#34;
                                          But yeah, what about you? What&#39;s something you don&#39;t
                                          really like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie

  : Well, I have something I don&#39;t like that
                                          I think is really popular. And every time I say I don&#39;t
                                          like it, I always get the same like, &#34;What?&#34; kind of
                                          reaction, but I don&#39;t like ice cream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : What?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : I don&#39;t like ice cream. I don&#39;t think
                                          food should be that cold. I don&#39;t like it. Food
                                          shouldn&#39;t be too cold to eat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : It&#39;s just not…
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  :
  <span class="audionotes">
   You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing
  </span>
  . Ice
                                          creams are really, really good especially in summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Chocolate is really good. Chocolate, I&#39;ll
  <span class="audionotes">
   take chocolate over ice cream any day.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Well, you can try chocolate ice cream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Oh, chocolate ice cream
  <span class="audionotes">
   is the worst
  </span>
  .
                                          Chocolate ice cream is the worst. No, thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : What about a second one? Do you have any
                                          second food that you don&#39;t like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : I don&#39;t like tomatoes. Which is strange because I eat lots of
                                          pasta with tomato-flavored stuff in it. But just
                                          tomatoes by themselves is not something I enjoy.
                                          Whenever I have like a hamburger with a tomato, I always
                                          have to take it out and give it to someone else. Just, I
                                          don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s just juicy and not in a good juicy way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : I don&#39;t like garlic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : You don&#39;t like garlic?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : I like garlic in food but I don&#39;t like to
                                          see it or eat it and have this, the taste of garlic, I
                                          don&#39;t like it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Once you&#39;ve got the taste of garlic, you
                                          don&#39;t get rid of that for about three days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Exactly. That&#39;s another thing. Yeah. So
                                          when my mom is cooking and using garlic, she ... after that,
                                          she had to remove it. She cannot leave any evidence that
                                          she was using garlic in her food. Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Is there another food that you don&#39;t
                                          like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : I would say sprouts, Brussel sprouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Yeah. No one likes sprouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yes. It&#39;s bitter and even though some
                                          people say it&#39;s good for your body, I don&#39;t like them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : I think, yeah, sprouts are just
  <span class="audionotes">
   universally hated
  </span>
  . No one like sprouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yeah. But when you are a child, your
                                          parents, for some reason always giving you that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Yeah. Cruel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yeah. I don&#39;t like it. It looks like – I
  <span class="audionotes">
   feel like a cow

  eating those things. Yeah.

 <p>
  <b>
   Katie

   Gilda

 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie

                                          I&#39;ve never actually eaten them but looking at them makes
                                          me really uncomfortable, and that&#39;s olives. I hate
                                          olives.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda

  <b>
   Gilda

  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie

                                          the hole in olives. I&#39;m like scared of olives. It&#39;s
                                          really strange, but no.
