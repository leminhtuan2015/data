 <strong>
  Lindsay
 </strong>
 : Hey, Warren.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Hey, how&#39;s it going?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Good. I thought today we could talk about childhood dreams. When you were ten years old, what did you want to be when you grew up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Right. Well actually it&#39;s a little embarrassing. I wanted to be a truck driver. I thought it would be really neat because you can just travel around everywhere and see different places all the time and you&#39;re always
  <span class="audionotes">
   on the move
  </span>
  . But you know I didn&#39;t become a truck driver.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : No, you didn&#39;t become a truck driver. Why is that? When did your dream change?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Well probably when I was around fifteen I thought it would be a lot cooler to be a rock star.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Rock star?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Yeah, a rock star. I really liked electric guitar at the time and a lot of friends were into music as well so I didn&#39;t actually start a band but I played with a lot of different people and sometimes I would play with some bands but I never really
  <span class="audionotes">
   stuck to it
  </span>
  . But I did keep playing guitar and I ended up getting pretty good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : What kind of rock star did you want to be? Did you want to be like a heavy metal rock star or a grunge rock star?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : I guess
  <span class="audionotes">
   versatile
  </span>
  would be the word. I liked playing a lot of heavy stuff and maybe some folk music as well, so kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   eclectic
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : So maybe a hippie rock star?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Yeah, maybe a hippie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : So then when you were twenty, did you still want to be a rock star?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : No I didn&#39;t but I still played guitar then. I actually wanted to be a classical guitarist by then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : OK. What is classical guitar?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Well it&#39;s funny you say that because it&#39;s not just classical music. Classical guitar is, for one thing it&#39;s the type of guitar. It has nylon strings, not the steel strings like you see on a folk guitar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : And there&#39;s different styles you can play on it like Spanish music, or flamenco, or South American music, some classical music like Beethoven and things like that, or baroque music like Bach.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Does it have a singer with it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Sometimes there are singers. Usually it&#39;s solo but you can play some
  <span class="audionotes">
   chamber music
  </span>
  with other instruments as well and yes I played some pieces with vocalists but it wouldn&#39;t be pop music.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : And so now you&#39;re older, did your dream come true? Did you become a classical guitarist?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : I did but I actually decided to change my dream after I become a classical guitarist.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : So what&#39;s your dream now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Well my dream now is to become a university professor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Oh, and are you making steps to achieve that dream?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : I am actually. I&#39;m working at a university now, not as a professor, as a part time lecturer but I&#39;m taking some courses and studying hard and hoping that my future will allow me to become a professor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : OK, well unless you change your dream again, I bet you&#39;ll achieve your dream so good luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Great. Thank you.
