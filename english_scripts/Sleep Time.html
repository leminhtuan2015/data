   Hana
  </strong>
  : So, how much do you sleep?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well I think I sleep a lot, usually at least 8 hours I think that&#39;s, that&#39;s the usual for me. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Oh really, about 6 hours I guess, if I have 6 hours
  <span class="audionotes">
   that&#39;s enough
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : 6 hours, is that enough?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yes and normally because I sleep late and I have to get up early so 6 hours is enough for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Wow if I sleep 6 hours I would definitely take a
  <span class="audionotes">
   nap
  </span>
  after lunch. Do you take naps?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Well it depends. If I don&#39;t have any class I would sleep but
  <span class="audionotes">
   normally
  </span>
  I don&#39;t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Wow, how about the weekends do you also sleep like 6 hours?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : No I sleep a lot on Saturdays because I normally didn&#39;t have anything to do so I will
  <span class="audionotes">
   recharge my batteries
  </span>
  and just sleep all morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : How about Sundays?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : On Sundays I normally get up early and do something and spend my Sundays with my friend or go out. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well, the bad thing is on Saturdays and Sundays I still get up quite early so I don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   get to
  </span>
  sleep more than the week but since I still, you know, sleep 8 hours every day so I think that&#39;s enough and if I&#39;m tired from the week I think I can still take a nap and I will, you know, fix it, so yeah, I think I sleep a lot like more than a lot of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it is.
