   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Phil, we both live and work in Japan. We&#39;re both teachers in Japan. Now are you homesick. Are there things that you really miss about England?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  The thing I miss the most, and it&#39;s going to sound really sad, is my cat.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s cute.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I love my cat. I don&#39;t know why. I&#39;m a bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   sappy
  </span>
  like that, so I really miss my cat.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, well talk about your cat. What&#39;s your cat like?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  My cat is black, very fat, very stupid like most cats but very lazy like me so we have
  <span class="audionotes">
   a lot in common
  </span>
  but just she likes to wake me up at six o&#39;clock in the morning and I really curse her and hate her. Still, I can&#39;t be angry about it.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, right.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  And sometimes she&#39;ll bring a bird in, and she thinks she&#39;s having a great present by brining us a bird and my mom gets really angry and...
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ooh! Wow! You&#39;re cats still primitive. It still goes out and kills birds.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, yeah, and occasionally mice because we live in the country so there&#39;s a lot of animals nearby and my cat will always try and catch them.
  <br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool... So what&#39;s your cats name?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Chaz.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Chaz?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah. We got her from a charity called the Cat&#39;s Protection League in England.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I&#39;m sorry. What&#39;s that? Can you explain?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  The Cat&#39;s Protection League is basically, there&#39;s a lot of homeless cats in England. People abandon them because they can&#39;t look after them or whatever reason and they will
  <span class="audionotes">
   take them in
  </span>
  and they will give them food and try to find them new homes and we found our cat from there.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you saved Chaz?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Kind of, yeah. I think we saved him. Maybe or maybe we condemned him. I&#39;m not sure.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what&#39;s cool about your cat, Chaz? I mean, why do you have this
  <span class="audionotes">
   bond
  </span>
  with your cat?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. Maybe we&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   on the same level
  </span>
  . We both like to spend our weekends sleeping all day and doing as little as possible, eating a sleeping so maybe we&#39;re just on the same level, but I&#39;m not really sure. We&#39;re just both as stupid as each other I think.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you would say you&#39;re definitely a cat person and not a dog person?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah. I like dogs but I think cats are actually more intelligent on a... like if you throw a stick for a dog, the dog will always fetch it. The cat will look at it and fetch your own stick you idiot.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true. That&#39;s true. Well, anyway, hopefully you&#39;ll be able to see Chaz soon.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. I hope so.
