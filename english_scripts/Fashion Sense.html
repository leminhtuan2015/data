  Todd:
 </strong>
 Well, what about clothes? Like, are you
 <span class="audionotes">
  a brand name person
 </span>
 ?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  No, not at all.
  <span class="audionotes">
   That&#39;s not my style
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so what determines your style? What influences you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Well, what I do when I go shopping. I usually have something in mind that I want to buy, so either a certain color or just a certain item of clothing and then I look around at all the different shops and compare the best prices and things like that, and then I&#39;ll buy the one that&#39;s the best deal and I&#39;ll feel really good about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So for your style, do you look around and also you say, &#34;Oh, I like what that person&#39;s wearing. I wanna dress this style&#34; or do you just think, you have your own style and you don&#39;t care if it
  <span class="audionotes">
   fits into a mold
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s a mix. I think that sometimes I&#39;ll see something that someone&#39;s wearing and I&#39;ll like it or want something similar and then of course that mixes in with things I already have, but I also like to make my own clothes, and remake clothes and things and things like that, so sometimes I&#39;ll remake something and realize that I need a sweater or something to go with it and then I&#39;ll just buy it based on something else I already have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, so you make your own clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   do it from scratch
  </span>
  a lot. Sometimes I&#39;ll go to
  <span class="audionotes">
   a craft store
  </span>
  and buy fabric and then cut it up and make a shirt from fabric, but often take a shirt or pants I already have and make into something. Like, I recently was living with a couple of roommates and my roommate was getting rid of all her old jeans so I cut her jeans up and cut a sweater up I had and then I made it into a jacket.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you still have it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Totally. I wear it all time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool. Alright, well, thanks Melissa.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  No, problem.
 </p>
