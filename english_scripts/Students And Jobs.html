   </strong>
   : You know, Greg, we were both talking about how we have part-time job, you know, I think there&#39;s a lot of benefit but
   <span class="style4">
    <span class="audionotes">
     looking back
    </span>
   </span>
   , sometimes I wonder if it&#39;s not so good if children work.
  </font>

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   Why?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   You know, I just think, basically, that kids get in this trap, they start working, they start getting a little money, they kind of get into buying things,
   <span class="style4">
    <span class="audionotes">
     consumerism
    </span>
   </span>
   , and they really don&#39;t focus on studying or being in clubs or just doing
   <span class="style4">
    <span class="audionotes">
     extra-curricular
    </span>
   </span>
   activities when they&#39;re young.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   But sometimes if people work, they learn that they have to work in order to get something and then
   <span class="style4">
    they
   </span>
   <span class="audionotes">
    transfer
   </span>
   <span class="style4">
    that to school
   </span>
   and say, OK, I have to work at school in order to get good grades, or to get into the high school I want, or into the college I want.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   I think it&#39;s nice to look at it that way but I think in reality, most people that are wealthy, their children don&#39;t work and they get better grades and they do activities that help their school resume, and as a result they get into the best schools, and they get the best jobs.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   Maybe the rich people are able to go to better schools cause their better schools in the rich area so their getting a better education, that might be one.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, that&#39;s true but I think maybe that if kids, if they start working and they work too much, then they
   <span class="style4">
    <span class="audionotes">
     lose their priorities
    </span>
   </span>
   , which should just be about an education.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   I agree if they work too much, but I think you learn a lot of things, which are very important, you know, there&#39;s a difference between book knowledge and world knowledge.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, that&#39;s true. Well, so how many hours would you suggest that a child works? Like for you what&#39;s the maximum hours that a kid in high school should work?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   A high school student should probably work no more than 10 hours a day.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, I agree. I agree. See when I was in high school, I was like working 25, 30 hours.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s, that&#39;s a lot.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Right, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m not a rich man today.
