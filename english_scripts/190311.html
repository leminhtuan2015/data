An Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet flying from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, Kenya, crashed six minutes after takeoff early Sunday morning, killing all 157 people on board.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Charles De Ledesma reports.
<br><br>
A spokesman for the Ethiopian Airlines says among the dead are 32 Kenyans and 17 Ethiopians while 31 other nationalities were also among those on board.
<br><br>
It's not immediately clear what caused the crash of the Boeing 737-8 MAX plane, which was new and had been delivered to the airline in November.
<br><br>
The state-owned Ethiopian Airlines calls itself Africa's largest carrier and has ambitions of becoming the gateway to the continent.
<br><br>

<br><br>
The plane is the same model that took off in October from Jakarta and crashed into the Java Sea a few minutes later, killing all 189 people on board a Lion Air flight.

Clashes and fierce fighting are being reported in northeastern Syria, where U.S.-backed forces say their final assault on the Islamic State terror group enclave of Baghuz is underway.
<br><br>
A spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces made the announcement on social media Sunday.  He wrote the offensive to wipe out the last remnant of the terror group's self-declared caliphate [reduced] resumed, that is, at 6 p.m. local time.
<br><br>
Earlier, he had tweeted that the last chance for any fighters or civilians still holding out in the small patch of land on the banks of the Euphrates River to leave had come and gone.

Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika landed in Algeria Sunday amid protests against his campaign for a fifth term as president.
<br><br>
The 82-year-old Bouteflika has been in Geneva for the past two weeks, receiving what his office called routine medical care.  But many have speculated that the health of the longtime president, who has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, is far more serious.
<br><br>
Protests against his campaign entered their third week on Friday.  Thousands of people flooded the streets of Algeria and Paris, which is home to a large Algerian immigrant population.
<br><br>
<br><br>
The White House said Sunday it does not "have any illusions" about whether North Korea is preparing to resume missile testing, but refused to assess commercial satellite imagery suggesting the North is assembling a new rocket.
<br><br>
National security adviser John Bolton told ABC News "We look every day at the North Koreans.  I don't want to get into speculation as to what they're doing."
<br><br>
He said that the U.S. "relies on its own" satellite surveillance and draws its conclusions from those images.
<br><br>
<br><br>
The White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday President Trump will call for a 5 percent "across the board" cut in domestic government spending in 2020 when he proposes his new budget on Monday.

<br><br>
Power has returned to some parts of Venezuela after several days of the country's worst blackouts but many areas remain without electricity and communications.
<br><br>
On Sunday, opposition leader Juan Guaid&oacute; once again urged the military to withdraw its support for the disputed President Nichol&aacute;s Maduro.

A man in Pennsylvania finds what he believes to be an R. Kelly sex tape from the 1990s while cleaning out an old box of videotapes in the home he shares with his wife.
<br><br>
Associated Press correspondent Julie Walker reports.
<br><br>
Gary Dennis says he has a collection of old VHS sports tapes and recently found one that was labeled "R. Kelly," which he assumed was a concert but instead "he was sexually abusing underage African-American girls."
<br><br>
Dennis works at a nursing home and has a daughter says he has never met R. Kelly and has no idea how the tape ended up in his home.
<br><br>
"What the children were subjected to do on the tape is sickening and shameful ...."
<br><br>
Dennis gave the tape to authorities in New York.  His attorney Gloria Allred says it appears to show a separate incident from the 10 counts of aggravated sex abuse that R. Kelly already faces in Chicago.
