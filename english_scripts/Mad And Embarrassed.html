  Daniel:
 </strong>
 Hey, Vella, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m good. How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m fine thanks. Is there, like do you remember any time where you&#39;ve been really sad or angry or embarrassed?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Actually it happened before I came here. I had
  <span class="audionotes">
   a huge fight
  </span>
  with my father, dad, and yeah we had a disagreement about something and I, well I had a disagreement with my aunt which is my dad&#39;s sister and my dad just kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   took her side
  </span>
  instead of my side and I was really disappointed in him and I
  <span class="audionotes">
   lost my temper
  </span>
  and I started hitting the window and it kind of broke and my dad was...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Wait a minute. You broke the window because you were angry?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I did.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I really lost my, you know, control and my dad he started crying and, you know, seeing him cry was really, you know, painful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Wow. I didn&#39;t know you were that kind of person that could break a window.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  You know when I lose my temper, I tend to do, you know, things that are
  <span class="audionotes">
   out of control
  </span>
  but yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  But what was the whole argument about? Do you think it would have that result like where you break a window because of an argument with your dad?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Well, I think it was just because I was really disappointed that he took, you know, my aunt&#39;s side instead of my side.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Hm, hm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  And he was saying stuff like, you know, it&#39;s all my
  <span class="audionotes">
   fault
  </span>
  and, you know, he was really disappointed in me so I was really sad that he said that and, yeah, I lost my temper and started hitting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK, how about being embarrassed? Do you remember any time where you were really embarrassed?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think in high school. So there&#39;s this guy I have a huge crush on and I was walking down the stairs and, you know, he saw me and, you know, I was acting like awkwardly and there was a big plant in front of me and I didn&#39;t see it because I was, you know, too busy looking at him and I kind of tripped over and it was really embarrassing and everyone was laughing and that guy, you know, saw me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s the worse thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Falling like in front of your crush, I think that will be really embarrassing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK, what did you do afterwards?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Well I just acted cool, you know, and said I&#39;m fine and just left.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Wow, that must be really difficult?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Because I was trying to, you know, look pretty as I walked down the stairs and I didn&#39;t see the plant in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  So after that did you ever get that guy to like you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Well actually he, you know, he came up to me and he was asking if I was OK and we ended up exchanging numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  So that was a success?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was a success.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK, that&#39;s pretty good.
