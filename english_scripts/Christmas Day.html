  Anja:
 </strong>
 So, Fred, tell me, what do you guys do on Christmas day? Like, what do you eat? When do you open the gifts? Who&#39;s coming over? Are you going to visit your family?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Well, Anja, the routine in Canada for Christmas is quite simple. The kids get very excited on the 25th because early in the morning, at around seven o&#39;clock, that&#39;s when we open the gifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, you
  <span class="audionotes">
   open the gifts
  </span>
  in the morning?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow.

  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  At around seven o&#39;clock in the morning, we... well, as I kid I remember being so
  <span class="audionotes">
   unbelievably
  </span>
  excited, so at night, I don&#39;t think I could sleep. I was too excited about waking up early in the morning and then opening my gifts. So what we do is that the parents put the gifts under the Christmas tree, and then early on the 25th, in the morning we all gather around the Christmas tree and then,
  <span class="audionotes">
   one-by-one
  </span>
  , we open the gifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  So you open the gifts in your
  <span class="audionotes">
   pajamas
  </span>
  , and then you...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. But that&#39;s not the most exciting part of the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, it&#39;s not? What is then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  No, the food is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  The food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  The food is the most exciting part of the day. Well, in Canada we eat lots of, as you may know, we have maple syrup.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, yes, that&#39;s right. You are really famous for that, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  For maple syrup. Maple syrup is something that Canadian people love eating during the Christmas holidays and so all of the time through the week of the 25th until New Year&#39;s Eve, the first of January, we cook many kind of different dishes and we just put maple syrup on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. For instance, what do you eat? Is there some traditional food you have for Christmas in Canada?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Of course. We have traditional food. As you may know, pancakes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  I love my
  <span class="audionotes">
   pancakes
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  You do, you do, yeah. Yeah, I love pancakes, too. We put maple syrup on it. Oh, it&#39;s so good, you know, and you know what else is really good?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  What is?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  We fry pig&#39;s ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh my god, you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s delicious, and the tongue of the pig as well. We fry it. And then we put maple syrup on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow, I didn&#39;t know that. That&#39;s quite interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s delicious. You should try it one day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, I will definitely.
