  Thailand is so different from where I used to live in America. First of all, in my neighborhood there are many
  <span class="audionotes">
   stray
  </span>
  dogs, dogs with no home. During the day, they lay around and sleep and at night they fight and make a lot of noise barking and howling. Sometimes they&#39;re even dangerous, especially people who ride by on their bikes, sometimes can be bit by these dogs. In America, stray dogs, are sent to the
  <span class="audionotes">
   pound
  </span>
  . The pound, the dog pound, is like a jail for dogs. Um, also, in front of my house, in front of every house in my neighborhood, there&#39;s a fence, or a gate with a lock on it. I don&#39;t like it. I think it&#39;s a hassle because I have to take out my key, unlock the lock, then drive the car out, stop the car, get out, close the gate and then put the lock on again. In America, it&#39;s much more convenient. Usually there&#39;s a garage or a closed car park and when you drive up you have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   remote control
  </span>
  , and it opens, the garage door opens automatically, and in America usually we don&#39;t have
  <span class="audionotes">
   fences
  </span>
  or gates around our front yard. Often there&#39;s a gate around the
  <span class="audionotes">
   backyard
  </span>
  , but nothing in the front. Some of the really expensive houses in Thailand too, around there fence they have broken pieces of glass around the top to keep people who want to climb in from getting in. In Thailand usually to buy food, you go to the outdoor market. It&#39;s very different than the clean supermarkets in America because they are lots of different smells and lots of action. You can smell fish, meat, trash, fruit, smoke from the barbeques, curry. Sometimes the smells are not so good. People come there, cook fresh food every day and they&#39;ll stay there till they sell all their food. It&#39;s very cheap. You can eat for about 2 or 3 U.S. dollars. So it&#39;s not as clean and it doesn&#39;t smell as nice as a big supermarket in America but I think it&#39;s a lot more interesting. It makes the supermarkets in America seem very boring.
