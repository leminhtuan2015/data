   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now Mike, we&#39;ve been talking about diabetes, and recently in the United States they&#39;ve wanted to put warning labels on things like soda and fast food, and things like that, warning about the possibility of getting something like diabetes. Do you agree with that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yes, I do. I think though they really should try to... and we talked about this before, but... they really should try to get, especially young people, children to have a healthier diet and a healthier way of being. Now, it&#39;s difficult when you&#39;re young and you see your parents and
  <span class="audionotes">
   they&#39;re 400 pounds each
  </span>
  , and you know, they&#39;re trying to tell the kids to eat healthier, be healthy. I think it adds into it, but I think it needs to start with... putting labels on things? I frankly, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s gonna do much to change. It works maybe with cigarettes but there&#39;s other reasons why people stop smoking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Well, I mean, nowadays a lot of times they want soda vending machines out of schools because they say that it creates bad habits. The schools can&#39;t get money without... well, they can get money, but it&#39;s easy for them to get money from the vending machines. How do you feel about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, I mean, they can, I think they should compromise. Putting vending machines in, but put healthy drinks in the vending machines. Put diet drinks instead of, you know, sugar drinks. Yeah, it&#39;s great having a brand-name soft drink machine that has it&#39;s number one selling soda, but to compromise so the children don&#39;t have
  <span class="audionotes">
   peer pressure
  </span>
  to buy those, put diet drinks, put fruit drinks, you know....
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Mineral waters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Mineral waters and things, sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. It&#39;s true. OK. So what about fast food? Do you think fast food should have warning labels or maybe signs?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, again, I mean, you know, it&#39;s been a big debate now for the last few years about blaming the fast food industry for everything. Yeah, I agree, fast food is not good. Generally, I never go to... I almost never eat fast food, but I think it&#39;s a... you know, everybody&#39;s responsible. They have
  <span class="audionotes">
   a conscious choice
  </span>
  of wanting to eat fast food or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, and it tastes so good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  It does, doesn&#39;t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It smells so good. It tastes so good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s true. It&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And it&#39;s cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  It is. It is. There&#39;s several factors why I think it&#39;s so.... it leads to these kinds of problems, like diabetes, but and it does. I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t, but I think it&#39;s  a conscious choice. I think people just need to be, you know, educated better and there&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a whole bunch of issues
  </span>
  but I think it&#39;s peoples themselves that need to realize that they have to balance their lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, I mean, actually, I think you know the government is taking
  <span class="audionotes">
   the wrong approach
  </span>
  , you know, rather than put warning labels on fast food, why doesn&#39;t the government spend more money teaching people how to cook. If both parents are working that means kids can&#39;t cook, or they can&#39;t learn from the parents how to cook so if kids learn how to cook, they would probably eat healthier diets.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Sure. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, there&#39;s a whole... like I said, there&#39;s many issues surrounding it but, yeah, I mean, just by putting labels, I think it&#39;s not going to solve any problems, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I agree.
