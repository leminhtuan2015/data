U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says Venezuela's leadership has to realize "the people have spoken" and forcefully rejected President Nichol&aacute;s Maduro and his regime.
<br><br>
Pompeo called the election that Maduro claims to have won a "sham" election.
<br><br>
The secretary praised Paraguay for being one of the 54 nations that have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaid&oacute; as Venezuela's true president.
<br><br>
"As a member of the Lima Group, Paraguay stands among the leaders in our hemisphere in defense of democracy, in calling out Maduro for what he truly is - a power-hungry tyrant who has brought ruin to his country and to his people."
<br><br>
The secretary later went to Peru for meetings with that country's president and foreign minister.
<br><br>
On Sunday, Pompeo travels to the border town of Cucuta, Colombian, where he is expected to meet with Venezuelan refugees.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde says her organization will not help Venezuela deal with its economic crisis until a large majority of its members decide who to recognize as the country's leader.
<br><br>
Speaking at the IMF meetings in Washington Saturday, Lagarde said the majority of members have yet to decide who to recognize and need to start the process.
<br><br>
"And as soon as that happens, and we can actually identify the authorities, then we stand ready to move in and help and, you know, sort of harness all our resources, if we are asked to help, together with others."
<br><br>
Venezuela has been struggling with a deep economic crisis marked by widespread food and medicine shortages as well as hyper-inflation.
<br><br>
An estimated 3.7 million Venezuelans have fled the country.

<br><br>

<br><br>
We get more from Reuters correspondent Lucy Fielder.
<br><br>
Leader number three for Sudan in as many days, yet another army commander, promising victorious and jubilant protesters that there will be a civilian government to follow three decades of autocratic rule under Omar al-Bashir.
<br><br>
Still Abdel Fattah al-Burhan Abdelrahmane says the transition could take up to two years, and the crowds on Khartoum's streets are impatient for change and an end to rule by men in fatigues.
<br><br>
Al-Bashir was arrested on Thursday after four months of protests over rising food prices, high unemployment and growing repression.

Malta's government announced a deal to distribute the migrants across four European nations - Germany, France, Portugal and Luxembourg.  However, Malta said the German flagged aid ship carrying them would still not be permitted to dock and none of the migrants would be allowed to remain in Malta.

The situation in and around Tripoli has become increasingly violent and unstable since a renegade general began an offensive April 4 to capture the Libyan capital.

<br><br>
So far this year, IOM has repatriated 3,175 migrants from detention centers and urban centers.
