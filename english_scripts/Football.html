   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Lois, so what do you think about the World, not the World Cup, the Euro Cup so far?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  So far it&#39;s been an interesting tournament. I didn&#39;t expect to see Greece and Portugal make it to the final. I was a little bid disappointed with England&#39;s performance, but I think they were beaten by a better team.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, really, you think so!
 </p>
 <p>

   </a>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I think on the day Portugal probably played better than we did and even though we were unlucky because we had a goal disallowed in the last minute, but yeah, at the end of the day, I think at the end of the day, they probably deserved to win.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mm, so what happened in the match?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  So I think if I remember correctly, the match was 2-all, but I can&#39;t remember exactly now. No, 1-all because at the last minute England scored to make it 2-1, but that goal was disallowed so then it went to extra time and then I think Portugal scored first, then England scored again to make it 2-all and then it went to penalties, and David Beckham missed, uh a terrible terrible goal, missed a penalty, and then I think Portugal missed one and then England missed again and then Portugal&#39;s goalkeeper scored and then it was all over.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, well, maybe next time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Maybe, maybe World Cup in Germany in 2006.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So who do you think is going to win it all?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  So in the first match, it was Portugal against Greece and Greece won 2-1, so although Greece are the underdogs, I think maybe they can win, but it is in Portugal, so maybe Portugal will win with the home crowd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Are you going to watch it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I would love to watch it, but in Japan it&#39;s on at 3:45 in the morning, and so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to miss my sleep to watch it.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sarah , so what sports do you like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  My favorite spectator sport is football. I support Newcastle United in England.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Newcastle United.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Newcastle United, Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Are they a good team?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Um, yeah, I think they&#39;re pretty good. They finished fifth in the premiereship this year,
  <br>
  so they&#39;re near the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so right now we have the Euro cup. And last night England played.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  They did
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, did you see the game?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Ah, no I was going to watch it tonight actually in Shibuya but I&#39;m thinking maybe not now
  <br>
  because we lost on penalties.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what was the score?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Ah, the final score was 2 all (2-2) and then it went to penalties and I think it was 6-4.
  <br>
  So England always lose on penalties.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  They always lose on penalties?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, sorry. Maybe in the World Cup, next time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Maybe. Maybe. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now do you ever play football?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;ve never played.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Never
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Never played, no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Do you ever go and watch games in Newcastle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Um, it&#39;s very difficult to watch games in Newcastle because it&#39;s a big club and it&#39;s Premiereship
  <br>
  and you have to book in advance quite a few years but I&#39;ve seen some first division football clubs
  <br>
  play against each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You have to get tickets two years in advance?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  For the big clubs, yeah. They&#39;re booked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty intense. So when there&#39;s a game on TV then what do you do? Do you watch it at home? Do you go to a pub?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Ah, it depends on the game. I like it and I like Premeireship football, and I like World Cup football
  <br>
  and Euro 2000 but I wouldn&#39;t watch particularly a first division game on the television, but normally I would go to the pub with friends and watch the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you think that athletes make to much money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  I think footballers do. Yeah, I think they do. I think they do a good job but I think they&#39;re incredibly overpaid.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think it is the same thing in the states. I think they make too much money.
 </p>
