   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Keiko, now you are back in Japan. You live and work in Japan. Do you miss things about the U.S.?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  Many things. First of all, I miss my friends a lot. I miss the food, especially Mexican food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Me, too. Me, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  Cause I think you and I both lived in California, the best place for Mexican food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, I&#39;m a
  <span class="audionotes">
   huge taco addict
  </span>
  . I love tacos and I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   bummed
  </span>
  that I can&#39;t get tacos in Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  Me, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what&#39;s your favorite thing in Mexican food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  I love burritos. It&#39;s a good combination of beans and rice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  I love -- and I used to go to this small burritos restaurant in The States and it was
  <span class="audionotes">
   run by
  </span>
  Mexican people and they didn&#39;t speak any English. We had to order in Spanish but the food was just as authentic as you can get.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s just fantastic back home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now you mentioned Spanish. Did you study Spanish when you were in high school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  Actually, I didn&#39;t because I was taking ESL class, English as a second language, so that counted as my foriegn language
  <span class="audionotes">
   credit
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You were taking ESL classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s not fair. You were getting easy A&#39;s.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  No, cause I think for three years I was sitting in the class and not understanding a word.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so. But you&#39;re perfectly fluent now so it is hard to believe you sitting in ESL classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  Well, thank you but it was pretty difficult the first three years and then finally one day, after three years, I just understood the word without trying to
  <span class="audionotes">
   translate
  </span>
  in my mind. It was kind of fascinating, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  When you were in The States what do you think helped you learn English the most, was it talking with people or listening to radio or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  I think everything, just to be in that situation and for just environmental English and my father tried to put me to the school where there&#39;s no Japanese so I don&#39;t hang out with the Japanese people so I was forced to be in a community of just American people so I think that was very, I learned in a hard way but I think it was the best thing that my father ever tried to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s interesting. Well, thanks a lot Keiko.
