   Paul
  </strong>
  : So being
  <span class="audionotes">
   fair-skinned
  </span>
  , do you burn easily in the sun?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I do! I get really, really
  <span class="audionotes">
   freckly
  </span>
  , just turn into one big freckle. I have to be careful not to get burned, yeah. I’m careful with my sun lotion. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I’m not a sunbather. I can’t think of anything more boring to be quite honest with you. I may not get it lying on the beach – you’ve got the sand, you’ve got the surf.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I do get it
  </span>
  , but I just get too bored. I’d rather be more active, doing some sort of swimming, some sort of activity….
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I really enjoy swimming in the ocean. If I go to the beach, I don’t sunbathe at all. I sit in the shade until I just want to swim in the ocean: go snorkeling, see something. That’s a lot more fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Mmmm, yeah, see something, explore a bit. Yeah, yeah. I mean the sea creatures are actually fascinating really. You put that snorkel on, it&#39;s as if you’ve gone into a new world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I couldn’t do that in
  <span class="audionotes">
   Scandinavia
  </span>
  , I don’t think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Speaking of Scandinavia, I did a home stay when I was a high school student.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh, did you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah, and it was with a Danish family. And the mother was very kind of typically Scandinavian. Uhm, like stereotypically very  strong, blond hair, and every day of the year
  <span class="audionotes">
   without fail
  </span>
  , she would swim in the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh my goodness.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : You know there’d big blocks of ice in the sea, and she’d still be swimming.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : A
  <span class="audionotes">
   sturdy lass
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah, she
  <span class="audionotes">
   swore by it
  </span>
  . I think she really believed that it was good for the circulation and her health. Yes, but admiration, but I won’t want to follow her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I don’t think I could - only certain times a year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
