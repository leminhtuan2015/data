  Todd:
 </strong>
 Alex, when you were little, what did you like to do?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  When I was small and I was in
  <span class="audiodef">
   junior high school
  </span>
  we
  <span class="audiodef">
   used to
  </span>
  like playing soccer with my friends. Actually in Kenya, what&#39;s different from other countries, we used to make our own soccer ball to play. So, it&#39;s very easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. How do you make the soccer ball?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  We used to collect like
  <span class="audiodef">
   plastic papers
  </span>
  and
  <span class="audiodef">
   bind them
  </span>
  with string, around them to make something round. So it was like, you didn&#39;t have to spend any money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s
  <span class="audiodef">
   ingeneous
  </span>
  . That&#39;s great. So were you a good soccer player?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Not really. I used to like playing soccer but I was not very good, actually
  <span class="audiodef">
   to tell the truth
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, me too. I wasn&#39;t a very good athlete. I mean I like sports but I was never any good. Um, so do you play soccer in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Sometimes, until last year when I was in school I still played soccer. Right now, actually I&#39;m not playing anymore because I&#39;m like busy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Yeah. You can&#39;t play soccer without a big group of people and everyone is busy right now so I&#39;m not playing anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s a
  <span class="audiodef">
   bummer
  </span>
  . Like I always want to play sports but it&#39;s hard as
  <br>
  you get older. When&#39;s the last time you played soccer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  About one year ago. I think November of 199?,...2003, November.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Actually in Kenya do you call it soccer or football?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  In Kenya you call it football.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Football. I&#39;m sorry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Actually, I&#39;ve been in Japan for sometime so I&#39;m used to calling it soccer. In Kenya you call it football.
