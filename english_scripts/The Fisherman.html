  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  So Darren, you’re from southwest Wales.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I’m from a place called Pembrookshire.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  OK and what can you do down there for fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  Well, most of what I do is, in my spare time, is in some way connected to sport. The last five or six years I&#39;ve started fishing again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Fishing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I know it’s got a bit of a dull image but I fished a lot when I was younger. I
  <span class="audionotes">
   gave it up
  </span>
  for about twenty years and someone
  <span class="audionotes">
   got me back into
  </span>
  it about six years ago and I really do enjoy it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  What is it that, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   draws
  </span>
  you into fishing, I mean ...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  Well, it’s quite unusual. We don’t fish as most people imagine where you sit by a riverbank and don’t move. The fishing I do is at night time. The fish come in a lot closer and I fish off the beach. Because they come in closer at night time, it’s the best time to go. So it’s quite
  <span class="audionotes">
   exhilarating
  </span>
  just being out there. You haven’t got to catch fish to enjoy it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  It’s great being under the stars and hearing the waves crash in. It’s just a beautiful place to be even if you don’t catch a fish...which is good news really because I don’t catch fish very often.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so if I wanted to have a go at fishing, what would I have to do? What kind of equipment would I have to get?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  Well I was amazed when I re-started how cheap it was. It was probably cheaper twenty years after I finished than it was when I packed it [
  <em>
   in]
  </em>
  . For about sixty pound you could go down to the local tackle shop and they’re very, very helpful. They’d kit you out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  And you could start, but what I would advise is that you would find someone who did know what they were doing, just to
  <span class="audionotes">
   show you the ropes
  </span>
  really. But I was amazed how quickly I got back into it after so long away.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  And what kind of fish are you catching?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  There’s loads of fish around the Pembrookshire coast. You know, absolutely loads of varieties, but we do target a fish called bass which I know there’s a lot of varieties around the world, but it’s a great eating fish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Oh, so you eat the fish you catch normally?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I would only take a fish from the sea if I was going to eat it. If I wasn’t going to eat it, I would put it back...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  o.k.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Darren:
  </strong>
  But the bass is a beautiful eating fish, quite expensive to buy in a restaurant so it’s a lot better to catch them yourself.
