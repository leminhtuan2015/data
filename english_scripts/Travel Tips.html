   Todd:
  </strong>
  Jason, actually I&#39;m going to England this summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah can you give me some advice about where I should go. I&#39;m gonna have about one week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  One week. What I suggest you do then is stay in the
  <span class="audiodef">
   suburbs
  </span>
  of London for a start, because it&#39;s a lot cheaper. If you stay in North London then you can spend all your money on rent. And I guess you should
  <span class="audiodef">
   go around
  </span>
  Central London. That&#39;s where all the tourist attractions are. That&#39;s where all the
  <span class="audiodef">
   nightlife
  </span>
  is. It&#39;s just got everything you need really, but like I said rent is way too expensive there, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now I was thinking of taking a
  <span class="audiodef">
   day trip
  </span>
  to Oxford or Cambridge or Bath. What would you recommend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  It depends really. Bath has got a lot of history. I guess Oxford is a lot quieter, but again there is a lot of nightlife there as well. It really depends what you want to do, but Bath is good for history, definitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What about Cambridge?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Cambridge I&#39;m not too sure about. I haven&#39;t been there so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. OK. If I want to go to Oxford or to Bath, how can I get there? Do I have to drive?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  The easiest way is to get a train. It can vary how much you wanna pay really. It&#39;s kind of
  <span class="audiodef">
   similar
  </span>
  to Japanese trains. But traveling as far as Cambridge and Bath would be quite expensive, maybe 30 pounds, which is quite a lot of money really, so.
