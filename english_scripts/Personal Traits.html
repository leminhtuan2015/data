   Todd:
  </strong>
  I thought we would talk a little bit about personality traits. So, I&#39;m gonna give you a quiz.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Oh,God, I&#39;ll probably fail.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, the first one is, do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   procrastinate
  </span>
  ? Are you a procrastinator?

 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes. For certain things. And also for study.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cause you&#39;re a student?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes. Yes. So. When I have study to do, it just more ahhhhh, there&#39;s other things that I could be doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so if you have a paper or something, you wait till the night before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah. It&#39;s always
  <span class="audionotes">
   last minute
  </span>
  . I&#39;ve heard that if you were a last minute person in high school, you will always be a last minute person throughout your life, so it doesn&#39;t leave much hope for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   set for life
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yep.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Next is, are you somebody who worries a lot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Sometimes. Yes. Probably when I need to plan things. Yeah. Then I&#39;ll worry about if everything is OK, but other times it&#39;s just... I&#39;ll just
  <span class="audionotes">
   go with the flow
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Go with the flow. Do you worry about things like money or do you worry about things like like the future or stuff like that? Or are you pretty much easy going and...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I sort of do think about the future a bit and worry a little bit of you know, what&#39;s gonna happen, but other than that, no, I just see what happens.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Money-wise
  </span>
  , not really worry about it too much. I can&#39;t budget, so I don&#39;t worry about money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, that last one is, what about details? Are you somebody who&#39;s really
  <span class="style6">
   picky about detail
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes. I&#39;m with paperwork. When something&#39;s written, or advertising things like that. At work, yeah, I was always very picky about the grammar or making sure that everything was in same font and lined up squarely so, yeah, but other than that, no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, then, just lastly, are you good at planning? Do you like to plan things?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I do. Yeah, I&#39;ve planned a holiday for my family over Christmas and New Years and that worked out really well, so yeah, I can plan things. Sometimes I plan like the future a bit too much, but yeah. Apart from that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s interesting. So in your real life, you&#39;re very organized and you plan, but in your student life, you procrastinate.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah. Completely two different lives I think.
