The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee has voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress.
<br><br>
As AP's Ed Donahue reports, the move came for not releasing an unredacted version of special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
<br><br>
The vote is part of the legal battle over access to the Robert Mueller Russia report.
<br><br>
"There are 24 ayes and 16 noes."
<br><br>
Ahead of the vote, President Trump asserted executive privilege over the report and reserved the right to block access.
<br><br>
Committee Chair Jerry Nadler says this is an attempt by the executive branch to take power away from Congress and the American people.
<br><br>
"We've talked for a long time about approaching a constitutional crisis.  We are now in it."
<br><br>
The ranking Republican on the committee, Doug Collins, says there is no constitutional crisis.
<br><br>
"This is simply another interest to defame the attorney general, to lower him in the eyes of the public ...."
<br><br>
Republicans on the committee say Democrats are not happy with the findings of the Mueller report.

President Donald Trump imposed new sanctions on Iran Wednesday hours after the Iranian president said he was pulling out of parts of the six-nation nuclear deal .
<br><br>
Trump said in an executive order there will be new sanctions on Iranian metal exports, including steel, aluminum, copper and iron, major source of revenue for Tehran.
<br><br>
The president's action came after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday his country would suspend its compliance with prohibitions on stockpiles of enriched uranium and heavy water that were imposed as part of the 2015 nuclear deal.
<br><br>
Rouhani said if there are no sanctions relieved in the next 60 days, Iran would resume uranium [eri...] enrichment, that is, at higher levels.
<br><br>
President Trump pulled the U.S. from the Iran deal one year ago.  The United States has reimposed sanctions against Tehran since.

The lawyer for Chinese tech giant Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou says that he will ask a Canadian court to stop the case against her because of comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump.
<br><br>
Meng is under house arrest in Canada awaiting possible extradition to the United States, where she is wanted on charges of fraud.
<br><br>
Her lawyer, Scott Fenton, said in a Vancouver court Wednesday that comments by Trump that he would intervene in Meng's case if it would help in U.S.-China trade negotiations showed that the case against her may be politically motivated.
<br><br>
Canadian police arrested Meng on a U.S. warrant in December on charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and defrauding banks by hiding her activities through a Huawei subsidiary.
<br><br>
China arrested two Canadians in December for alleged spying in apparent retaliation for Meng's arrest.  Another Canadian citizen sentenced to 15 years in prison on drug charges in China now faces the death penalty.

<br><br>
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He arrives in Washington this week for trade talks with the United States as the Trump administration prepares to raise tariffs on Chinese goods in the middle of his visit.
<br><br>
A notice published Wednesday from the U.S. Trade Representative's office gave formal information that the U.S. will boost tariffs from 10 to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports on Friday.
<br><br>
That increase will take effect on the second day of Liu's visit, but President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday that China had informed Washington it was sending Liu to make a deal.
<br><br>
The Chinese Commerce Ministry has vowed to take "necessary" countermeasures if the U.S. imposes new taxes.

A Pakistani Christian woman who spent eight years on death row over false blasphemy charges left the country Wednesday.
<br><br>
As Reuters correspondent Emily Wither reports, Asia Bibi is headed to Canada.
<br><br>
Six months after being acquitted by Pakistan's top court over false blasphemy charges, Asia Bibi has left the country for Canada, according to her lawyer.
<br><br>
When she was released in October, hardline Islamists rioted on the streets and called for her to be killed.  Bibi had been staying at an undisclosed location under tight security.
<br><br>
Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had previously said his country was in talks with Pakistan about helping her.

Archie is seventh in line to the British throne and he is Queen Elizabeth's eighth great-grandchild.
