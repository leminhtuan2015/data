   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, let&#39;s talk about hobbies. What do you like to do in your
  <span class="audiodef">
   free time
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  You mean other than seducing ladies?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, we might actually have women listen to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Just joking. Just joking OK. I like windsurfing. That&#39;s my number one hobby, and surfing I&#39;m in progress, and I like skateboarding but I&#39;m getting old, so it is kind of
  <span class="audiodef">
   tiresome
  </span>
  . What else do I like? I like going to restaurants, going out, bars, restaurants,
  <span class="audiodef">
   bar hopping
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool, yeah, I like to bar hop. Let&#39;s go back to the windsurfing, um, how long have you been windsurfing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Since 26, so that&#39;s 4, 5, 7 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  7 years! Yeah, where did you first begin windsurfing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Kamakura.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, in Kamakura. That&#39;s a beautiful place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  In winter, yeah, but in summer, it&#39;s, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s questionable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really? Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Oily.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cause the water is polluted.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, cause people, a lot of people come from the city. They put oils right oil, and they go swimming into the ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You mean suntan lotion
  <strong>
  </strong>
  from people&#39;s bodies gets in the water and makes it oily. That&#39;s disgusting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Isn&#39;t it. You see the oil floating around in the ocean. It&#39;s kind of sick in summer, so I really don&#39;t windsurf in summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, it must be hard to, if there is so many people in the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but there is a swimming section and a windsurfing section, but anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, did somebody teach you to windsurf?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, my brother. Oh, your brother. OK. Did it come easy for you, or was it difficult?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  It is really difficult to explain windsurfing cause, I show you. Can you stand up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so I&#39;m standing up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  And your holding your rig, and go back, you are like 80 kilometer and your body is more closer to the ocean and your body is like down here and like 80 kilometer and waves are like 4 meters and on a good day so that is really radical.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah that sounds difficult. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready for windsurfing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s pretty interesting though. It&#39;s free too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But the equipment must be very expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  The first time yeah, but once you buy and have everything down it&#39;s free to go surfing to the beach so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How many windsurfing boards do you have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Two.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Two. And do you have to do a lot of work to
  <span class="audiodef">
   maintain
  </span>
  them, to keep them clean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Not really cause out in the ocean just wash with the water, clean water, that&#39;s about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How far do you live from the beach?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  It takes me about, about an hour from my house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  One hour. Boy. That&#39;s
  <span class="audiodef">
   dedication
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s like, how can I explain this, what are your hobbies there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I like running so yeah I run all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Right, but it&#39;s not, you feel like you are dedicating your energy to the running.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, No. Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  You do it because it is fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, yeah, maybe I&#39;ll have to try windsurfing one of these days. I&#39;ve always wanted to try that and surfing. It look like a lot of fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Come. I have my board and my surfboard too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s right, you have two boards, so, hey OK. Thanks and we have to go before it&#39;s summer. Now it is spring, and all the oil in the water, that&#39;s disgusting. I can&#39;t. I thought you meant like oil from ships or sewage from the city. OK. Oil from people&#39;s bodies. Well, there must be a lot of tan bodies.
