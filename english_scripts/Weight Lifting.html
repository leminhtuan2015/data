  Todd:
 </strong>
 Mike, I thought we would talk about weight training. You&#39;re kind of an expert. I see you in the gym a lot. You&#39;re always, you know, lifting weights. How did you get involved in weight training?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, I started in high school. I&#39;ve played sports since I was little and once I got to high school, we had to start weight training for our team.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and so did you just start with like, you know, the basics, like free weights or did you do like the machines?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, we had a weight lifting coach so we did both machines and free weights and he made sure that our form was correct and we did everything properly, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, now, actually which did you prefer, the machines or the free weights?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  I prefer free weights. Yeah, I think machine is a little bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   more restrictive
  </span>
  than free weights so if you know how to... if you have
  <span class="audionotes">
   proper guidance
  </span>
  , then free weights are better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, actually you play soccer. Is that correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  See, that&#39;s interesting cause I wouldn&#39;t think that soccer players would
  <span class="audionotes">
   be into
  </span>
  weight training.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s the usual way of thinking for a lot of people, but actually now people into playing soccer are doing a lot more weights.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But when you lift weights, don&#39;t you feel that you&#39;re more tight? Or you&#39;re tighter? That you&#39;re not flexible?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but that means that you have to stretch. Do a lot of stretching as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, stretching is just as important as the weight training?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, you don&#39;t play soccer anymore, do you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  No, after college I&#39;ve retired from competitive sports.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, do you still
  <span class="audionotes">
   follow the same regiment
  </span>
  that you did with your soccer training?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  No. Weight lifting when you&#39;re not playing sports is different than when you are playing sports, so now I just lift to
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep fit
  </span>
  and not actually for sports performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s interesting. Like, what is different about doing weight training for sports and doing it just to be fit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  The exercises vary a lot. If you&#39;re doing, for sports, you do things that you need to do a lot of explosion work so that you can move faster or better and... whereas if you&#39;re just staying fit, you just do more to get exercise and you know, to keep your shape.
