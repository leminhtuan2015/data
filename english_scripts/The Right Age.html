  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : So I want to ask you about when is the
  <span class="audionotes">
   right age
  </span>
  to have stuff or to start doing stuff. What do you think is the right age to start having a phone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh, I think for security reasons, to, you know, keep the child safe, perhaps maybe about 11 or 12 when they start going around places without their parents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : It would be a way for me to contact my daughter. Even now, my daughter is only six and she doesn&#39;t have a phone, and that&#39;s far too young, I believe. However, she walks to school by herself and walks home by herself. And that
  <span class="audionotes">
   stresses me out
  </span>
  for her safety.
 </p>
 <p>
  So there are times where I wish I could phone her or text her, but she doesn&#39;t have a phone. And I do believe that six is far too young to have a phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : A little bit too young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yes. So
  <span class="audionotes">
   purely
  </span>
  for
  <span class="audionotes">
   security reasons
  </span>
  , I think probably around 11 or 12.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : How old were you when you first got your phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Well, I&#39;m an old person so, you know, people didn&#39;t have mobile phones. I was reaching the end of high school. I was, I think, 17 when I got my first mobile phone. And it was a big brick. But again, that was for, you know, I guess security reasons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : My parents got it for me. I was going out, you know, I started going out at night, going to concerts. And I was beginning to be allowed going into bars and things at 17, 18. So yeah, it was a good security thing. My parents were appreciative of being able to contact me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : How about you? How old were you when you first got your mobile phone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Oh goodness. I was about 12 or 13. I was really young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : And I only got my first mobile phone or my first cellphone because my best friend who got the same one and I wanted to send like picture messages to her. It was
  <span class="audionotes">
   back in the old days
  </span>
  where you can send a photo, you can take photos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Picture messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Picture messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I couldn&#39;t even send picture messages. Mine was just texts, like pressing the same button over and over again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So I never really used it as like a way of security. I just used it to send really
  <span class="audionotes">
   overpriced
  </span>
  picture messages to my friend for absolutely no reason. It was such a waste. And to play Snake. Do you remember Snake?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah, Snake.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Like the little game that you could play on your phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yup, yup.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I didn&#39;t use it for a good use, I think. I just used it to waste time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Fair enough. Well, you&#39;re 12, you said, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Twelve, thirteen, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : That sounds age appropriate, I think, age appropriate use.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s a good time to start wasting your time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Get ahead to start wasting time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
