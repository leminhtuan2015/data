Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives launched a wide-ranging investigation Monday of President Trump's 2016 campaign, his businesses, and whether as president he has obstructed justice in an effort to stop investigations of him and his family.
<br><br>
Mr. Trump has long denied wrongdoing involving his campaign.

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports from the White House.
<br><br>
The panel has sent document requests to 81 people touching all parts of the president's life from sons, Don Jr. and Eric, to former adviser Steve Bannon and Sean Spicer.
<br><br>
It makes some specific request like asking Michael Cohen for any audio or video recordings of his talks with the president.
<br><br>
Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler says the investigation will look into obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power.  But the document requests are a way to start "building the public record."
<br><br>
One official familiar with the probe says most responses are due in two weeks and the committee expects some people may eventually face subpoenas if they do not cooperate.

Hundreds of Islamic State fighters and family members fled the northeastern Syrian village of Baghuz on Monday, taking advantage of a pause in ferocious fighting with the U.S.-backed forces that have surrounded the last patch of the terror group's self-declared caliphate.
<br><br>
AP correspondent ??? reports.
<br><br>
A spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces tweeted that the battle to retake Baghuz was going to be over soon despite the slowdown.
<br><br>
Later, an SDF official said some 500 people including fighters have surrendered and evacuated the village of Baghuz and its surrounding areas.  Dozens of men, women and children climbed hills on foot and were later seen getting into small trucks.
<br><br>
