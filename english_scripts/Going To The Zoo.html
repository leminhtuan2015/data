  : So Meg, we are talking about animals; do
                                          you like to go to the zoo?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : I love to go to the zoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Okay. So when you go to the zoo, what
                                          animals do you like to watch?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : I really like to watch giraffes. Giraffes
                                          are so tall and giraffes look really soft and friendly,
                                          so I wish that I could touch a giraffe someday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Oh, that&#39;s so true. There is a zoo near my
                                          house in California, and you can walk up some stairs and
                                          then you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   feed
  </span>
  the giraffes, and their face is the
                                          same height as your face, and they look really, really
                                          cute. Yeah, giraffes are great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Giraffes are so cute. Maybe someday, I can
                                          feed the giraffes.

  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : I like how giraffes look. I love their
                                          face. And I also love camels, also because I think
                                          camels have a similar face. They look really cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : I don&#39;t think camels are very cute.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Yeah. They&#39;re so hairy. Camels have so much
                                          hair that they look ugly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Oh really. I like camels. They always look
                                          cool and relaxed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : They do look relaxed, but I like giraffes
                                          better than camels.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Well, what about llamas? Llamas are
  <span class="audionotes">
   kind
                                          of like
  </span>
  camels and they&#39;re kind of like giraffes. They
                                          kind of have the same face. Do you like llamas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : I think llamas look cute but I&#39;ve heard
                                          that llamas aren&#39;t very friendly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Have you heard about llamas
  <span class="audionotes">
   spitting at
  </span>
  people before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : No. Actually, I think I heard camels do
                                          that but maybe llamas do it, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Hmm, I&#39;m not sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Okay. So what about other animals? What
                                          other animals do you like at the zoo?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : I really like the zebras because zebras are
                                          black and white with stripes. So the zebra stripes are
                                          really cool, and zebras are similar to horses. So
                                          sometimes I think I could ride a zebra if I had one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. That would be cool. Zebras do look
                                          pretty cool. Are there any other animals?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Well, there&#39;s one animal that I&#39;m afraid
                                          of, and that&#39;s a bear.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah, bears are pretty scary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Bears are really scary and they&#39;re so big
                                          with huge teeth and giant
  <span class="audionotes">
   claws
  </span>
  , and I feel like a bear
                                          would eat me if I met it in person.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Actually, have you seen a bear
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the
                                          wild
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : No. I have never seen a bear in the wild,
                                          and I really don&#39;t want to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Well, in California, sometimes you can see
                                          bears in the wild, small black bears. And actually, the
                                          black bears are not that dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. I mean, you need to be careful when
                                          you see a black bear in the wild, but they almost never
                                          attack anybody. So the one animal you must be afraid of
                                          though, is the mountain lion. So there are mountain
                                          lions also in California, and they are scary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Hmm, so maybe I should avoid mountain
                                          lions, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. If you walk in the wild and you see
                                          a mountain lion, maybe it&#39;s too late. You&#39;re already
  <span class="audionotes">
   in
                                            trouble
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Maybe I&#39;ll just keep going to the zoo.
 </p>
 <p>

   Todd
