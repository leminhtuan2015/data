   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Well, I got these in the states actually, and if you ever want to borrow them you can?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Thanks, thanks. I think we&#39;re maybe not the same size.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Right, right, a little different. Yeah, the slippers are kind of a nice touch to it. We have to wear slippers where we work, so even though we work inside a university building, and we go outside actually, everything&#39;s in slippers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so you got the slippers in the states?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I got the slippers in, because my feet are so humongous that I would not be able to get.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  They&#39;re not that big!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  There size ten.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ooh, that&#39;s
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Yeah OK. Well, they look comfortable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  They are. They are. They&#39;re like clogs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and where, the pants?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Express
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Express is a store?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Is a store, in America, yeah. Just a, kind of, they&#39;re business, business casual.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How much did you pay?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Ooh, too much I think! About 50 dollars U.S.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  for pants?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  For pants, but they&#39;re
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve never paid 50 dollars for pants in my entire life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  No! Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well it shows, my fashion sense. And your shirt, your blouse?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I got it from, from, Learners, which is also another store in the states, and this was like actually 35 dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  35 dollars! You spend a lot of money on clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t though. I just, for business clothes. You have to have professional looking clothes so..
