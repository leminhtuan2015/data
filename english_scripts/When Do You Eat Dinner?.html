   John
  </strong>
  : Do you always have dinner at a different time, too?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : No. I almost always eat dinner around 6 o&#39;clock. How about you? When do you eat dinner?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : My dinner time varies a lot just like my breakfast. So maybe I eat dinner later than most people. I think I would have dinner at 7:00 PM at the earliest. But sometimes, I will have dinner as late as 9 o&#39;clock at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I don&#39;t mind it. I really like cooking so, if I&#39;m cooking a short thing, I&#39;ll have dinner earlier. But I don&#39;t mind if it takes two hours to cook something really good, I&#39;ll eat later at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Wow. Can you tell me about your work routine? What time do you usually go to work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : See, my work schedule is different everyday. That&#39;s why I wake up at a different time everyday. Maybe on â€“ for example, some weeks on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, I start work at 7:00. But on Thursday and Friday, I don&#39;t start work until 11:30.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Ah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : How about you? Do you have a different work time sometimes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Well, right now, I&#39;m on maternity leave. So I stay home and take care of my new baby.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh, congratulations.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Thank you. I try to work at home a little bit everyday though. If the kids are sleeping or they&#39;re playing quietly, I try to do some work. Maybe around 2 o&#39;clock, I can usually get some work done because the kids are sleeping.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh, if you don&#39;t start getting some work done until 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, you must be very busy every morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I usually go to the grocery store. Sometimes I take the kids to the park around 10:00 in the morning. I often do the laundry or wash the dishes, and then as soon as the dishes are washed, it&#39;s time to make lunch. So I&#39;m busy all day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : I see. So that&#39;s why your lunch time can change so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh, it sounds like a busy day.
