  Todd:
 </strong>
 Hello, I&#39;m here with Anita. Anita, where are you from?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I am from the Czech Republic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, and what city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Ah, from the capitol city, Prague.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s a beautiful city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yes, it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Can you talk a little bit about your city?

  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  OK, Prague is a very
  <span class="audionotes">
   historical
  </span>
  city. It&#39;s got many, many old buildings. It&#39;s very popular among foreign tourists, especially. The
  <span class="audionotes">
   main attraction
  </span>
  is the Prague Castle, which is right in the city center. That&#39;s where the President has his office.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Inside the castle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yeah, in the castle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s really cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yes, yeah, it&#39;s really beautiful. Of course you can&#39;t go into his offices, but you can go into the premises of the castle and walk around and there&#39;s a very big cathedral right in the middle of the castle and it&#39;s absolutely gorgeous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, actually, I saw the castle many years ago, about 12 years ago, and if memory serves it was built by the Romans? Or am I wrong?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m not very good in history, so I&#39;m sorry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, I...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m not sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m probably very wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  But, one of our late last kings. He was an emperor of Rome as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  A Roman Emperor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, so maybe that&#39;s it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Something to do with Rome. Anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Somebody will probably write me now and tell me the history. And there&#39;s also a really famous bridge correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  The Charles Bridge. Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  The Charles Bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, it must be nice to be living in a city with so many beautiful buildings and history.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  It is. You know, I mean, of course it depends where in the city you go because the city center is the historical part but when you go to the
  <span class="audionotes">
   outskirts
  </span>
  of the city, that&#39;s where it is... that&#39;s where you get buildings from the
  <span class="audionotes">
   Communist era
  </span>
  , so it&#39;s not colorful. It&#39;s all grey. It&#39;s all one style and it can get pretty ugly in some parts, but if you stick to the city center it&#39;s gorgeous. It&#39;s like a fairy tale.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So would you say then that your city is
  <span class="audionotes">
   a mix of
  </span>
  new and old?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Um, I probably wouldn&#39;t say a mix of new and old because they&#39;re not mixed in one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s old in the center and then new, not modern... I wouldn&#39;t say modern, but new, Communist new in the outskirts, so it&#39;s separated. It&#39;s not mixed together, which is good because when tourists come they don&#39;t get to see the ugly parts as much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s like in the States. Believe me, every city has it&#39;s ugly parts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess.
 </p>
