   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now Norman, you&#39;ve lived in Japan for awhile. Have you lived in any other countries?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Norman:
  </strong>
  Yes, I&#39;ve lived in Germany as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Germany!

   Norman:
  </strong>
  Yes, I lived for five years. I had two contracts in Germany. The first one in the seventies, for three years. I was an immersion teacher, which means that they&#39;re English students at the elementary level who take all their courses in French, so with a particular second language approach I would teach them not only French, but I would teach them mathematics in French, science in French, visual arts in French, physical education in French
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, in Germany.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Norman:
  </strong>
  In Germany, yes! This was for the Canadian Armed forces. The, usually it&#39;s the man the father, who&#39;s there as a soldier, but sometimes it&#39;s the woman. But they have, they do have children and there was a need for some Canadian schooling. They hire teachers to teach the children of military personnel.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! What a cool job! What did you think about Germany?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Norman:
  </strong>
  Germany is very interesting in that it&#39;s a very lively country, I find. I enjoyed certainly the nature part. Every weekend, Susan and I tried to go on what they call volksmarch, which means, it&#39;s, &#34;volks&#34; means popular, popular walk. You have a choice of five kilometers, ten kilometers, or fifteen kilometers walk and at the end, once you complete the walk, you get a metal, and the walk is always in some nice
  <br>
  village. You go up the hills, up the mountains, you have beautiful sights, and every now and then they have some kind of a food stand with a Bavarian band playing, and then you have those Bavarian sausages and it&#39;s just a whole lot of fun so we would take our children along with us and it would be quite an event.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s nice. How long did you live in Germany?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Norman:
  </strong>
  I lived there five years total. 75 to 78,for a three year contract, and then 85 to 87, a two year contract.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, so you speak German as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Norman:
  </strong>
  I do, I do, but now I have not spoken it for quite a long time so it would take a little bit of, let&#39;s say, review.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! tri-lingual. That&#39;s cool!
