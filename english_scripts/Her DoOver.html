   Adam
  </b>
  : Hi Sarah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Hi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Today we’re talking about do-overs. So if you had a time machine and you could go back to your college years, is there anything that you might change or do differently?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : I really wish that I would have had the chance to study abroad. I chose the wrong major initially. I was a nursing major for two years, and worked really hard at a major I was really bad at. And then after two years, I
  <span class="audionotes">
   switched
  </span>
  schools and switched majors. And because of that, I had so many credits to take that I couldn’t study abroad or do really any extra classes that were fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Hmm, that must have been challenging. Where would you have liked to study abroad?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Really, anywhere. I’ve always loved to travel, so I would have been open to going anywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : So you said you studied nursing, what would you have studied
  <span class="audionotes">
   otherwise
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Well, I first went into nursing because everyone since I was really little told me that I would be a good nurse. So I thought it was my calling in life. And then after taking lots and lots of science classes, which I’m really bad at, I decided to switch majors to education. And then I
  <span class="audionotes">
   ended up
  </span>
  liking that major, so I’m really happy that I switched.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Was there any other major that you would find interesting that you might study if you went back or you’re satisfied with education?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : I’m glad I did education because I really liked that work wise. But if I had to go with things that I’m interested in, I probably would have been some sort of art major. Both of my
  <span class="audionotes">
   siblings
  </span>
  are artists, so it kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   runs in the family
  </span>
  a little bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : What kind of art do you like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Mainly dance, but I also was really into music growing up, so musical instruments and singing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : So, do you have any friends that were interested in art or dance that you had in those times?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Not really. No, actually.
 </p>

 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Do you wish that if you were in a group of people that like the similar things that you might have pursued different interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Hmm, definitely. I wish I would have done more with dance. I was a ballerina for 12 years. And I
  <span class="audionotes">
   gave up on
  </span>
  that when I was 14. So I got to the level where I either had to train professionally to do that for a job or stay in a class where the younger girls would keep moving up. And so at that time, I quit.
 </p>
 <p>
  And although I don’t wish I was still doing ballet, I wish I would continued some kind of dance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : So Sarah, any funny haircuts or anything like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Actually, yes. One week before I moved away to college, I cut my hair boy-short. And then after that, like during my first semester, I’d dyed it all different shades of red. And my hair has actually been pretty much every link and every natural-ish color.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Wow. How did your friends and family respond to your red hair?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : My mom didn’t like it so much. She thought I was going to die like a natural red color, but it was more of fuchsia red color. So she didn’t like it very much. But my friends and like siblings understood because I’ve always been very different and didn’t really care what other people thought about how I looked.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : How long did you like it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : For a while until I wanted change. I love change, so I’d always switch it to something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Well, that’s great. Thanks, Sarah.
