  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Melissa, this week we&#39;re talking about buying things. Now, in terms of shopping, are you one those people that are like a
 <span class="audionotes">
  shop-o-holic
 </span>
 ? You buy things you don&#39;t need?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yes, but recently I&#39;ve been trying to
  <span class="audionotes">
   veer away from that habit
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what influences you most to buy something? Is it like commercials or is just impulse?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s kind of just having the money and feeling like I deserve it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, it&#39;s a reward?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s always a reward for something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, how about ... how persuaded are you to buy something by commercials or advertising or things like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Defintely food commercials persuade me to buy it. Like I&#39;ll see a food commercial or even a picture of deliciously looking food and I&#39;ll want to have it, so I have two or three
  <span class="audionotes">
   concrete examples
  </span>
  over just the past month where I saw an ad for food and I went and bought it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. Like what did you buy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  One was hot Hotto-Motto. It was like a kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   fast food chain
  </span>
  and they were selling a fried chicken on rice that looked really good, and the other was a McDonald&#39;s Cinnamon Role.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you saw it and you&#39;re like, I gotta have it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and like one
  <span class="audionotes">
   weird thing
  </span>
  happened. I just say a red and yellow sign and it reminded me of Wendy&#39;s and then I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   craving
  </span>
  a chocolate milkshake ...frosty ... so I went somewhere else and bought it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you got it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
