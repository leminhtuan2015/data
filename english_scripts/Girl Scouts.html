  When I was eight years old I went to Girl Scout camp with my best friend Lauren. It was for two weeks and it was in the middle of July so it was really hot. We had no air conditioning. We actually slept in
  <span class="audiodef">
   tee-pees
  </span>
  like the native Americans. It was a great time. Everyday we
  <span class="audiodef">
   took swimming lessons
  </span>
  . We went to
  <span class="audiodef">
   arts and crafts
  </span>
  . We had to help cook the meals. We made breakfast, lunch and dinner. We learned how to canoe, ride in a canoe, and we also, what did we do? We rode horses, too. We got to ride horses. At first, maybe the first three days, I was really
  <span class="audiodef">
   homesick
  </span>
  , and I cried and I wanted to go home but after one week I loved it and I
  <span class="audiodef">
   didn&#39;t want to leave

  .
