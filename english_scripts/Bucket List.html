  : So Adam, we&#39;re talking about bucket lists, so things that you would like to do before you die. So what&#39;s your number one thing on your
  <span class="audionotes">
   bucket list
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Oh, difficult question. Number one, I&#39;d probably have to say, oh, skydiving maybe. I’ve wanted to do it for a long time. And I went bungee jumping in New Zealand. That was fun but I still have not yet been sky-diving. And jumping out of the plane just sounds like an awesome idea to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : What other kind of adventure sports have you done?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : This summer, I was – what did I do? Sand boarding in Peru. That was fun. When I was younger I did a lot of snowboarding and skateboarding. And yeah, I really enjoy extreme sports. I ride a motorcycle currently. If I could I&#39;d love to race cars professionally, although I don&#39;t know how good I&#39;d be at it. But it just looks like so much fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. Well, it’s
  <span class="audionotes">
   never too late
  </span>
  to start something you want to do, so you should add that to your bucket list. So tell me what else is on your bucket list?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : I really want to write a book. Be the author of a novel. I&#39;m always in the process of writing something down but it never seems to come to complete book type end result. But maybe eventually, all of these little things that I have written down will come into a book form and I can publish it and complete my goal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : What kind of things do you write? Like what kind of genre or is that kind of all the same or do you write many different styles?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : I wrote a lot of different things. One thing that I write is travel stories from my travels abroad or
  <span class="audionotes">
   anecdotes
  </span>
  that I come across when I&#39;m traveling. Recently, I&#39;ve been writing jokes. I really enjoy watching stand-up comedy and have got kind of inspired from them to write some stuff down, although I&#39;ve never really presented it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I also write, I guess, fantasy stories as well. I have a few short stories but it&#39;s been difficult for me to try to put them into book, like a longer version of them. The details are tricky to write down.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Wow! That&#39;s really interesting. Hopefully, one day, we&#39;ll be able to read a book written by you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Yeah. That&#39;d be great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. So tell me what else is on your list?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : The other things would be traveling to Europe, which I plan to do hopefully next summer, so I can
  <span class="audionotes">
   cross that one off
  </span>
  the list. I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Europe especially Italy and Spain. So I&#39;m excited to get that one done.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I&#39;d also really like to go to Africa and go on a safari and see, you know, lions, tigers in the wild, in their
  <span class="audionotes">
   natural habitat
  </span>
  . I&#39;ve also heard that you could see sharks, Great White sharks in South Africa on the coast. I had some friends that went and sat in a cage in the water and had Great White swim by. That sounds like a terrifying and
  <span class="audionotes">
   once-in-a-lifetime
  </span>
  experience. I&#39;m terrified of sharks but it would be quite amazing to see.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sarah: Yeah. I am terrified of sharks as well, so I probably will not be adding that to my bucket list. But yeah, I hope you get to do everything that&#39;s on your list there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adam: Thanks. Me too!
