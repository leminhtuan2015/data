   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Joel, how was the bowling match?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Not bad, I won the first one but I lost the second one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. How&#39;s your arm feeling?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Not bad. My hands are a little tired but my arms
  <span class="audiodef">
   fine
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so, are you going to go home and put some ice on it or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t think so. I think I need to
  <span class="audiodef">
   get a beer
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A beer. OK, actually as soon as we finish this I&#39;ll be
  <span class="audiodef">
   right with you
  </span>
  . Why is bowling so popular do you think?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s cheap and you can spend as much time here as you want. That&#39;s what I like about it. I noticed like, we can sit there and talk and we&#39;re not under a
  <span class="audiodef">
   time limit
  </span>
  or anything. We can just
  <span class="audiodef">
   take our time
  </span>
  . And you don&#39;t need any special skills to play it. Anybody can do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. How long have you been bowling?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Not long. Maybe I&#39;ve only been ten or fifteen times in my whole life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. (Yeah) Well you look pretty good for only ten or fifteen times.
