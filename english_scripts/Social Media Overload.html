  Katia

 : I&#39;m doubting, I&#39;m
 <span class="audionotes">
  doubting
 </span>
 if the whole Facebook and Twitter, if that&#39;s actually good. It seems like generations now are spending so much time in computers and virtually but not really doing outside activities so I wonder if there should be a change and perhaps not allow it so easily or be or have more restrictions on it.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : That would have to be something with children, right? Like if children or younger generations are spending more time on Facebook or on social media online than spending time with their real friends outside playing or doing stuff in the park or going to special classes or something. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have brothers or children or anyone that I could talk about but I don&#39;t know. What do you think?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : I would be worried if I had children and they were into all these social media things that it&#39;s hard to
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep up
  </span>
  even for me and even for us. I feel that, you know, some people that we don&#39;t know might be
  <span class="audionotes">
   spying on
  </span>
  us; we&#39;re just open.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that&#39;s another case. That&#39;s another thing like it&#39;s very easy for somebody to find out about you and what you do or who your friends are. That specifically, that&#39;s a difficult topic in a country like Mexico or some Latin American places where it could be that, criminality is higher and you know you don&#39;t want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   disclose
  </span>
  information to other people, even non specifically a country but in a place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : That is true. I would really, I don&#39;t know, it seems like my doubts are increasing about social media and what it&#39;s actually doing to us and what it will do to our generations so I really wonder how much or how should we handle it? I really don&#39;t know. Also phone texting, it&#39;s been used so much that we don&#39;t talk on the phone any more or we don&#39;t even talk person to person. We just text message.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s right, that&#39;s right. I&#39;ve noticed that especially in younger generations. They are so into texting. They text so fast. I cannot do that. Like to me it&#39;s way easier just to grab the phone and call someone, get the thing done, that&#39;s it. But texting takes so long but there are so many people into it especially younger kids.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yeah, so I wonder what it actually does to our communication skills. I am sure they have to change.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Well it
  <span class="audionotes">
   evolves
  </span>
  differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
