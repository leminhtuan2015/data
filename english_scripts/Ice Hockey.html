   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Chris,
  <span class="audiodef">
   Friday the 13th
  </span>
  is
  <span class="audiodef">
   coming up
  </span>
  . So, first of all, are you superstitious?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Yes. When I play sports I&#39;m
  <span class="audiodef">
   superstitious
  </span>
  . I have a
  <span class="audiodef">
   lucky shirt
  </span>
  and stuff like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what&#39;s your lucky shirt?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a bungy jumping shirt that I got about 10 years ago. It&#39;s all falling apart but it&#39;s still my lucky shirt.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, So you don&#39;t wash it or anything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  If I have a good game I don&#39;t wash it until I have a bad game and then I
  <span class="audiodef">
   wash the badness out
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What sport are we talking about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  I play ice hockey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, so your a hockey player! Your a pretty
  <span class="audiodef">
   solid
  </span>
  guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;m a goalie. Being a goalie it&#39;s a lot to being comfortable in the position, so if you have a good game you don&#39;t touch anything. You do the same routine. Goalies are known to be a little strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. So that&#39;s cool. Are you still playing in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve played a few times but it&#39;s just too much trouble to drag my equipment on three trains and a taxi and about a 800 meter walk. It&#39;s just not worth it right now. If I had a car I&#39;d try for sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s too bad. Alright, well, good luck and...so right now is your shirt dirty of clean? Your unlucky shirt?
  <br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s just been washed. Yeah, it needed a good washing this time.
  <br>
