  Doron:
 </strong>
 So, we are both expats. We both left our home countries. Are you going to go back, do you think? And live in Jamaica?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pernais:
  </strong>
  I will. I will, eventually. I think Jamaica is the only place that I could actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   settle down
  </span>
  in. It’s the only place that I would really consider home, because so much of who I am is dependent on my culture.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Your roots.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pernais:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Do you have a lot of family back home?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pernais:
  </strong>
  I do. I do. Yeah, that’s the biggest part of home for me, my family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  So when you say you will go back, when are you thinking? Like soon or in 20 years when you finish looking around the world?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pernais:
  </strong>
  That’s it. I want to see the world first, but I need to be home at least once a year to keep that connection with my family and with my culture really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Hooray
  </span>
  for air travel, right? You can always slip back. I’m the opposite, I think the one place I couldn’t settle down now is probably England.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pernais:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  I’m the same as you, I think I have to see the world, but I think the world is just too big to ever settle in one place. One of my goals -- I like to set myself targets -- and one of them is to see every country in the world. And I thought I’d been to quite a lot but I counted a few weeks ago. I’ve only been to 30 and there’s at least 6 or 7 times that many, so it’s going to take me awhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pernais:
  </strong>
  Hopefully, you’ll get it all done.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I do have family at home of course in England and I miss them and I see them every couple of years but I think I’ve got travel
  <span class="audionotes">
   in my genes
  </span>
  ‘cause my mom left home when she was 17, my dad has moved all around the world, my brother now lives in America (he was born there), so I think our family just loves to travel. How about your family, are they all back in Jamaica?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pernais:
  </strong>
  Not all of them. Actually a lot of my relatives live outside of Jamaica and it’s always good to go home for Christmas because everybody comes back home and it’s just like this really nice family
  <span class="audionotes">
   atmosphere
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Where do they all live now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pernais:
  </strong>
  Mostly in America and Canada.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Have you been to visit them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pernais:
  </strong>
  I’ve visited a few of my cousins in
  <span class="audionotes">
   the States
  </span>
  in Florida and New York, but I haven’t been to Canada. I’ve been to Quebec but not to visit family.
