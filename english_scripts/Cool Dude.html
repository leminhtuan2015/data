   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so now we are going to talk about other people, so you can talk about somebody else, a friend, a family, a
  <span class="audiodef">
   celebrity
  </span>
  . Who would you like to talk about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Anybody?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Anybody.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Who rips.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Who rips? What does &#34;rips&#34; mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Ripping means if you are like a surfer, if you say he rips, he is really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. He rips! Wow, so just for surfing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  And windsurfing, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  He rips. Skateboarding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Skateboarding too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Skateboarding, he rips
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it means he can make some great moves.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Great turns, great flips. OK, who rips?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Just go to the beach, and you see it. Like, you don&#39;t even have to talk, you just have to see it, and if you rip then you get
  <span class="audiodef">
   respect
  </span>
  , and if you talk, if you have a chance to talk to the guy, it&#39;s almost always that he is a nice guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Well, 99 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So guys who rip are nice guys.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Nice guys. Like nice, meaning, it&#39;s nothing like talking to a salary man.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, so very
  <span class="audiodef">
   easy-going
  </span>
  <strong>
   ,
  </strong>
  very friendly, not serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yes. Like open, no attitude, no attitude,it&#39;s like a way to elaborate.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so do you rip?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  No. I&#39;m in progress. I&#39;m trying. It&#39;s hard. It&#39;s hard to rip though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But you said earlier that you are very good windsurfing so you are closest to ripping at windsurfing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Man, In my dreams, but in reality, I&#39;m, no, I&#39;m trying.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maybe you&#39;re being
  <span class="audiodef">
   modest
  </span>
  . So a modest person doesn&#39;t say he rips or he is good
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  You got the point, no I was just
  <span class="audiodef">
   kidding
  </span>
  , I can&#39;t rip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, who is the best surfer in the world?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Robbie Naish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Robbie Naish. What country does he come from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Hawaii.
  <br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, so he&#39;s hawaiian. He&#39;s American.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, fom Ohahu!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  From Ohahu, so he surfs on waves.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  -- How big are the waves that Robbie Naish surfs on?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  OK like Jaws, there is a specific point in Maui, Hawaii Maui, and it&#39;s called Jaws, cause people say that there are a lot of sharks at the point, but anyway, at Jaws 25 meters or 30 meters in winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man, that&#39;s high. 25 to 30 meters. That&#39;s what? Three stories? Maybe!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s like from here to the basement.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! And were on the second floor so that&#39;s three stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Oh, right, right, right, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man, that&#39;s high. That&#39;s really high. What&#39;s the highest wave you&#39;ve ever surfed on? So you&#39;re standing up here. The ceiling!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah! Probably the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So that&#39;s what, maybe 10 feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know the feet stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So that would be, 3, 4 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, 3, 4 meters probably.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s still pretty high.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, if you are in the ocean you are like lying down right, so it&#39;s quite high actually, yeah, if you&#39;re standing up it doesn&#39;t seem that high but.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But, when you&#39;re on the ground, you&#39;re right, when you&#39;re lying flat on your stomach, you&#39;re right it would seem very high. So Robbie Naish, does he make a lot of money surfing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yep.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s a rich man.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s a billionaire.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, has he ever come to Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Many times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yep.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  For promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  For promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  He owns a boarding, sailing, and what have you. He owns a lot of companies. Yeah, he&#39;s smart too. Nice guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nice guy
  <strong>
  </strong>
  and he&#39;s a nice guy because he rips.
