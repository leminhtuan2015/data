   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Layla, we&#39;re talking about being an
  <span class="audionotes">
   au pair
  </span>
  . What is the daily routine of an au pair? Like, what do you do everyday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  So, every day I wake in the morning at seven and I
  <span class="audionotes">
   take care of
  </span>
  the kids, and get them dressed. I drop them at school. After that I go to my class. I take a class, and English class, and then I pick them at 12:30 at school. And he come back at home, the kid, and he
  <span class="audionotes">
   take his nap
  </span>
  . After that we go to the park by car, go to the library or until the parents come back from their work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   full-day
  </span>
  . So what&#39;s the best thing about being an au pair?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  The best think for me I think is to meet new people and new culture, new lifestyle, and I think for me it&#39;s a very good experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is there anything difficult about being an au pair?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  The most difficult I think it to be far from our family because for me it&#39;s the first time so it&#39;s a little bit hard, but just one year, it&#39;s gonna be OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, for an au pair is it your job to like cook and clean and things like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  Most of the au pairs cooks for the kids and
  <span class="audionotes">
   do the laundry
  </span>
  . I don&#39;t. But, yeah, usually the au pairs have to clean up after the kids. Do their laundry. Clean up their bedroom, and yeah, taking care of the kids. Yeah.
