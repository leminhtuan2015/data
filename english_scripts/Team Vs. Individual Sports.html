 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Santi are from Indonesia, correct?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I take it
  </span>
  , you can play sports all year round cause it&#39;s really warm?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes. It&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what kind of sports do you like to play?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  I like swimming and I like doing yoga. I like sports that involve like individual, not the group kind of sports.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You don&#39;t like team sports?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s interesting. So why? What is it about team sports you don&#39;t like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, when you play individually you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   compete
  </span>
  with yourself. It&#39;s much better for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so like if you&#39;re swimming, you can increase your time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes. That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What about yoga?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  I yoga just for relaxing and just release my stress.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  See, I love team sports, you know, there&#39;s something about team sports. It&#39;s so fun. Like you have
  <span class="audionotes">
   camaraderie
  </span>
  . You have friendship, you know, like you share the
  <span class="audionotes">
   thrill of victory
  </span>
  or you share, you know, when you lose, the pain of the loss. I just love that. When you do something individually, you just don&#39;t have that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes, sometimes, it&#39;s true ... your opinion about that, but in my opinion, I think when I do sports, I&#39;m very competitive, so if I get into a group, that is full of my friends, sometimes when we got lost, sometimes I feel angry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You want to put the blame on your friends?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Sometimes I put the blame on mine, if it is my fault, but sometimes, yeah, it&#39;s just like not going so well at the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. That&#39;s true. That is true. I kind of see your point.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  And I feel
  <span class="audionotes">
   disappointed
  </span>
  in them sometimes, so I&#39;m not very good at teamwork when doing sports.
