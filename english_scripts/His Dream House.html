  <b>
   Spencer
  </b>
  : Yeah. So Curtis, what would your dream house be like? Tell me about the kitchen, living room, yard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Curtis
  </b>
  : Well, I&#39;ve thought a lot about my dream house and designing it. Actually, that&#39;s the kind of work that my father does, so he said he could draw the plans up for me. But I&#39;ve done a lot of art and I really want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   work my art into
  </span>
  the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  So the living room, I would like there to be kind of a frieze around the outside of the room where I actually do the art myself. Now, I used to do a lot of construction when I was younger, and so I would really like to take part in the process so that I have a kind of sense of ownership with the house that I&#39;ve really built a part of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  The kitchen, I want it to be a very large space and next to a room that has a lot of media so that you can kind of pay attention to things or watch tutorials and recipes while you&#39;re cooking, follow along with your favorite chefs or cooking channels. I&#39;d like a really big
  <span class="audionotes">
   industrial
  </span>
  refrigerator and a huge island that I can work with, as well as a massive sink for cleaning things.
 </p>
 <p>
  I used to work at a restaurant and I loved the dishwasher there because it was so quick and easy. So I would like a restaurant-style dishwasher in my kitchen, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Spencer
  </b>
  : Yeah. So tell me about – what would your yard be like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Curtis
  </b>
  : I would like a lot of grass. I really love a yard with nice grass especially when you&#39;re playing soccer, you can get under the ball and have a lot of fun like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Spencer
  </b>
  : It&#39;s nice to have a big
  <span class="audionotes">
   backyard
  </span>
  to play sports.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Curtis
  </b>
  : Yeah. I think so as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Spencer
  </b>
  : What about your bathroom?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Curtis
  </b>
  : My bathroom. Well, I would like to have a kind of a spa in there, honestly. I would like to have a big bathtub. But I want my house to have geothermal heating. And if I have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   geothermal
  </span>
  heating system, I can also probably have a hot spring in the bathroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  I like it to be quite big and have a nice shower as well. Just very nice open area with nice sinks. I don&#39;t want to feel constrained in my bathroom. I don&#39;t want it to be small. It has to be big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Spencer
  </b>
  : What about your living room?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Curtis
  </b>
  : My living room. One of the things that was really important to me for my living room again, is the art that I want to have a lot of details around the outside that are
  <span class="audionotes">
   murals
  </span>
  or friezes that I have actually created on the wall and so that there&#39;s almost a kind of entertaining sense about it. Just being in there before you turn on any other devices or televisions or anything like that. That there is kind of a artistic and comfortable feel to it. It doesn&#39;t feel sterile, it feels very homey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Spencer
  </b>
  : Cool. Would you have a big garage?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Curtis
  </b>
  : I probably would have a big garage because I really love driving, and I used to race cars at the track. And for the purposes of doing work on cars, or any other DIY work around the house, I would like to have a really big nice garage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Spencer
  </b>
  : Would you have any sort of like swimming pool or – I know you said you wanted a sauna in your bathroom but…
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Curtis
  </b>
  : I would really like a portion that&#39;s maybe separate from the bathroom, that has
  <span class="audionotes">
   shutters
  </span>
  that open up. So on a nice night, you can actually open it and see out over the yard or whatever landscapes that the house is built next to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Spencer
  </b>
  : That would be cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Curtis
  </b>
  : But I would like the area to be a little bit private, hopefully surrounded by woods a little bit where you can&#39;t see your neighbors immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Spencer
  </b>
  : Yeah, exactly.
