   Kara:
  </strong>
  So, planning this next trip coming up, we need to start thinking of how much money we need to save, how much money we&#39;re going to spend on flight and hotel, and how much we&#39;re gonna have to tell the other girls to bring.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I actually meant to ask you
  </span>
  about that just because it seems that I don&#39;t bring enough money, so this year I&#39;m really trying to save more money. Make sure I have enough for everything. Starting with the flight, how much do you think we&#39;re gonna pay for flights this year and when do you think we should book to get the best price?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Well, flights right now
  <span class="audionotes">
   are running about
  </span>
  two hundred dollars per person round trip and that includes taxes and everything, but of course the closer it gets to the date of when we&#39;re gonna go the less seats are available so they&#39;re priced higher. So, I think it&#39;s best to book at least two months before we leave and we&#39;re gonna be paying probably around two hundred dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Sounds good. I think I&#39;ll have the money ready by then. So what do you think we&#39;re gonna do about hotel this year? There are gonna be six girls going so I&#39;m thinking we can afford something a little bit more expensive this year, maybe get a nicer room, try new hotels.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true. It&#39;s being
  <span class="audionotes">
   split between
  </span>
  the six of us. We normally budget between a hundred and a hundred and seventy-five dollars per person and that&#39;s for three nights. So I think it will be around that range: a hundred, about a hundred and fifty,
  <span class="audionotes">
   give or so a little bit
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  I think the hardest part about saving money for this trip is because of how much shopping we do, so I think I really need to save the extra money for that because I know we like to spend a lot of money on shopping and also eating out. We&#39;ve been wanting to do nicer restaurants so how much do you plan on bringing this year?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s hard to say really. We also have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   take into account
  </span>
  cabs and the gambling we want to do. My normal rule of thumb when I go to Las Vegas is to at least bring a hundred dollars per day, but that doesn&#39;t include my money for shopping, so normally to gamble a little bit with, for cabs, and for entrance fees, and shopping is extra on top of that. But that&#39;s another problem I&#39;ve always noticed. people never have change for the cabs. We need to tell everybody to bring one dollar bills and five dollar bills so that they can pay the cabs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Not only for cabs, but you know in Vegas we&#39;re constantly having to tips everybody: the people that carry our bags in, the cab drivers, and even bouncers at the doors for the night clubs when we go dancing, so we definitely need to let everybody to know to be prepared and always have a lot of cash on them - exact change to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Yeah, or else we end up footing the bill.
