   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you were saying you went to Laos, you went to Thailand,
  <span class="audiodef">
   by any chance
  </span>
  did you go to Malaysia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I spent, I spent some time in Malaysia. The first stop, we went there from Singapore, just taking a bus and we ended up in Malacca. Stayed about five days in Malacca. Malacca&#39;s nice. There&#39;s a lot of history there. We learned a lot about the
  <span class="audiodef">
   colinization
  </span>
  of Malacca, the Portuguese and then the Dutch, and then the English and then the Japanese, and, yeah, it was a really interesting place. There was old St. Peter&#39;s Church. There&#39;s several Mosques. It&#39;s a good place to spend for a few days. From there we went to Kuala Lumpur. We didn&#39;t really spend much time in Kuala Lumpur. We had spent a week in Singapore and were pretty tired of cities. so we only spent I believe two or three days in Kuala Lumpur, just visits from shopping malls, the KLCC, the Petronas Towers, and yeah, that&#39;s basically what we did in KL, and then we went to the Cameron Highlands, and if you like hiking, the Cameron Highlands is a great place for you. I don&#39;t know, they might have 16, 17 different marked trails. There&#39;s a whole lot of unmarked trails. We spent a month there. I think I only went on only six hikes maybe during that month but once again we were being lazy, and yeah, if you&#39;re an avid hiker then you&#39;re certainly going to enjoy the Cameron Highlands.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually, I did the hike in the Cameron Highland once, and foolishly I started my hike at about 4 o&#39;clock and I thought I could make the loop of the trail at the time, and the sun started to go down, and I was in the jungle, and I was worried about getting back, and I just
  <span class="audiodef">
   made it back
  </span>
  , but I was pretty scared for awhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  You were lucky. Some people don&#39;t make it back.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Well, Jim Thompson.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Maybe you&#39;ve heard of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually, why don&#39;t you tell the people about Jim Thompson?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Jim Thompson was a trader. I think he was maybe based in Hong Kong, but I&#39;m not sure. Maybe it was based in Malaysia. He went hiking. I believe it was 1967, in the Cameron Highlands, and no one has seen him since. He&#39;s just vanished from the
  <span class="audiodef">
   face of the earth
  </span>
  . So, be careful if you go hiking there.
  <span class="audiodef">
   Watch your step
