  Daniel
 </strong>
 : Hey how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Fine and you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Good thanks. I have a question. I&#39;m planning to go to Buenos Aires.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : And I need your advice
  <span class="audionotes">
   basically
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Sure, no problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : What&#39;s the city like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Well, the first thing you will notice when you are there, it&#39;s like everybody in a hurry, everybody is busy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : And everybody has a lot of things to do. And I&#39;m not only talking about working, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : What else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Usually porteos, people from Buenos Aires, is very stressful but once you finish your work, you have a lot of things to do in the city like you have
  <span class="audionotes">
   plenty of
  </span>
  cinemas, restaurants, theater, festivals. I don&#39;t know, so many things. Tell me what kind of things you like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m looking for something that it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   unique
  </span>
  in Buenos Aires.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  :: I think that one like unique from Buenos Aires is like art in the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : This is one thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : What about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Art in the street means you are walking and you will find like people dancing tango.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Or people like playing music and that is
  <span class="audionotes">
   free of charge
  </span>
  of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, because they&#39;re in the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Yes. So once they finish they will offer you one hat and if you enjoy the
  <span class="audionotes">
   spectacle
  </span>
  , you will put some money on there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK, that&#39;s a good nice idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Yeah. But besides these kind of shows, you can also find cultural spectacles more organized like in theater or there is an opera house, a big one, where you can also enjoy ballet, like high quality opera and ballet.
