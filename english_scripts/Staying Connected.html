  Tom:
 </strong>
 Jess, usually when I see you, you&#39;re sitting at the computer checking your e-mail. How many times a day do you check it?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  I honestly don&#39;t count, but many, many times. Definitely more than twenty times a day. It&#39;s not really necessary.
  <span class="audionotes">
   It&#39;s not like
  </span>
  I have millions of e-mails coming into my account every day, but I&#39;m very impatient and I hate waiting for responses or waiting for something that I&#39;m expecting so I&#39;ll check my e-mail so that I can receive it as soon as it&#39;s sent. How about you? Do you check your e-mails often?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  I suppose I check once a day, and if I have any mail, it will be one or two weeks before I reply to it. I&#39;m really bad at keeping in touch. I&#39;ve got accounts at facebook and my space and hi5, all these social networking sites, but I almost never log on and people .... I got a message the other day, a friend telling me, I&#39;m a boring facebooker. It&#39;s official because I haven&#39;t updated my profile in so long.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  Why don&#39;t you? Is it that you haven&#39;t got enough time?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  I have got so much free time. I think it&#39;s just because I&#39;m very lazy. I take photos. I meet people. I do things. I just don&#39;t feel the need to tell everyone about it
  <span class="audionotes">
   at the end of the day
  </span>
  . My family have kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   gotten used to
  </span>
  it now. They know that I&#39;ll get in contact they&#39;ll likely to see me in the next few months, or I&#39;ll get in contact if there&#39;s a birthday or a baby, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   apart from that
  </span>
  , I really don&#39;t keep in touch very well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  Apart from e-mail, neither do I. I did join Facebook a couple of years ago when all of my friends did and everyone was sending me links to join, and I created my profile, but to be honest, it&#39;s too much for me to have more than one thing to check that many times a day, so usually I
  <span class="audionotes">
   stick to
  </span>
  e-mail for communication. Yes, I do check it a lot, but I think if I started checking Facebook as regularly, I wouldn&#39;t have time to do the things I need to every day.
