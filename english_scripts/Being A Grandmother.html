   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So, Vivian, you have grandchildren!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  I have two lovely granddaughters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Granddaughters! What&#39;s it like being a grandma?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  It is a
  <span class="audionotes">
   second chance on life
  </span>
  because of when you are raising children as a young person you get caught up in the daily world, but with grandchildren it&#39;s all fun. I don&#39;t have to do this, or I don&#39;t have to do that, and when I get tired I can send them home to their parents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Right, that&#39;s the best part, right? So what else is different about being a mother versus being a grandmother?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  Being a mother you are totally responsible for your child. You are trying to raise them the best you know how to raise them and you&#39;re young and everything that you do you know that will be picked up by your child but when you have grandchildren that
  <span class="audionotes">
   duty
  </span>
  is up to their parents so I don&#39;t feel that I have to really teach them anything. I have to continue the teaching of their parents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So you get to do all the fun stuff now that you&#39;re a grandma?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  Yes, it really is fun. They
  <span class="audionotes">
   take you by the hand
  </span>
  , and take you to the store and point out everything in the world that mom and dad will not give them and it really costs you a lot of money sometimes, unless, you do
  <span class="audionotes">
   put your foot down
  </span>
  and say, ”NO!”
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So being a grandma is more expensive that being a parent?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  Absolutely, but it&#39;s a lot more fun because at
  <span class="audionotes">
   this stage of life
  </span>
  you have a little bit more money than you had when you were raising your child.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I see. That&#39;s great.
