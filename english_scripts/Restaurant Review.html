   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Adrienne, what did you think of the restaurant?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  It was good. The food was tasty but not as good as Italian food at home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I kind of think the same thing. It seemed like the noodles were a little hard, I guess you can say.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Plastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Like, yeah, I agree.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did you like the salad?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Uh, salad was good, but it&#39;s hard to mess up salad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, although that salad was pretty nice, right. It was chicken and sauce and peppers and stuff so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  And asparagus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like I can&#39;t make that salad. So that was pretty good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s true. I guess your right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And what did you think about the pizza?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  The pizza was delicious. I would like it to be a little bigger, because pizza at home is usually much bigger but, it was still very good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I forgot, how much was the bill. How much did we pay?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  About 3,000 yen I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  3,000 yen, so what do you think? Is that expensive or cheap or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  That seems pretty standard for Tokyo I think.
