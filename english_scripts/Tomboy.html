   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Okay, so Rebecca, we just talked about kids and technology, and you asked me whether or not I should give a cellphone to my son.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Now, I would like you to give me a little bit of advice for my daughter. I have a daughter, and she&#39;s only seven months old, but I&#39;m worried about when she&#39;s older, when she gets a boyfriend, and when she has her first date, and when she&#39;ll start wearing make-up, so could you kind of give me some advice about this?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Well, I think maybe I had a bit of an unusual experience. My mom actually made me wear make-up. When I got into high school, it was like -- you know, in middle school, I was the kid with you know braces and glasses,
  <span class="audionotes">
   stuck in a book
  </span>
  , and my mom was like you can&#39;t do that in high school, you &#39;ll never meet anyone, so she took away my glasses and made me get contacts. And I couldn&#39;t do anything about the braces, but you know, as long as you cover mouth or do something weird when you smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Wow, that sounds quite the opposite to many of my friends, like they all wanted to wear make-up, and their parents wouldn&#39;t let them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  No, I was a
  <span class="audionotes">
   tomboy
  </span>
  . My mom was actually kind of worried, like, she&#39;s like, do you have any interest at all in
  <span class="audionotes">
   girlie things
  </span>
  . I was like, no, I don&#39;t like shoes, I don&#39;t like clothes, I don&#39;t need a purse. I&#39;ll just go climb a tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  So, do you think it&#39;s important as a parent to
  <span class="audionotes">
   steer your children
  </span>
  to like kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   sculpt them
  </span>
  , and make them into
  <span class="audionotes">
   more rounded people
  </span>
  , or do you think you should just
  <span class="audionotes">
   let them go
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  At the time, I think I actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   resented my mom
  </span>
  for it, cause like she waxed my eyebrows. My mom removed my eyebrows. She sat me down and was like &#39;you have a unibrow that is not acceptable&#39; and she
  <span class="audionotes">
   pinned me down
  </span>
  and
  <span class="audionotes">
   ripped them out
  </span>
  , and I screamed and I hated her for weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Wow, how old were you when she did that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  It was the end of middle school sometime. But middle school, high school, somewhere in that area.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  So like fifteen?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Fifteenish, yeah. I didn&#39;t shave either. My mom actually shaved my legs the first time. She was like you need to shave this now.
