   Todd:
  </strong>
  Masako, I was very surpised to hear that you are actually a grandparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Masako:
  </strong>
  Yes, yes
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You look very young. I was very
  <span class="audiodef">
   shocked
  </span>
  . Tell me about your grandchild.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Masako:
  </strong>
  She&#39;s a baby. Of course. A baby, a baby girl. And her name is, it&#39;s Holly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Masako:
  </strong>
  Holly
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Holly
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Masako:
  </strong>
  Holly. H-O-L-L-Y. And in, with Japanese kanji, it&#39;s written with the two parts, and one part is the tree, and another part is winter. So she was born in winter. Her name is winter tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Masako:
  </strong>
  And it&#39;s, her name is &#34;Shuu&#34;. It
  <span class="audiodef">
   sounds like
  </span>
  a boys name, but her parents want to, want her to be a boyish girl.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Oh, like a
  <span class="audiodef">
   tomboy
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Masako:
  </strong>
  Yeah, maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maybe. Um, so how does it
  <span class="audiodef">
   feel
  </span>
  to be a grandmother?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Masako:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m very proud of it. And then I know if I see her, if she&#39;s with me, living near to my house, then I forget every other thing and then I&#39;m just very...how do you say? A grand mother who is really
  <span class="audiodef">
   occupied
  </span>
  with her grandchild.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, like just um
