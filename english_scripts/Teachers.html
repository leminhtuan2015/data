   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you know, you have a very small school. Have you ever worked for a large school before?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Yes, I&#39;ve worked basically
  <span class="audionotes">
   every different type of school possible
  </span>
  to work here in Japan, starting with the kindergarden, junior high, senmongakko. I was at a university for four years and I also did a little bit of intensive English camps just a couple of years ago.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you said senmongakko. What&#39;s that?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a kind of technical or
  <span class="audionotes">
   vocational college
  </span>
  . It&#39;s a two year school.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I forgot to mention that I also taught at business company classes and of course, ei-kaiwa or language school here, too.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, do you think that, you know, when you have your own... from a teaching point of view, when you have your own school, is the instruction different for a small language school compared to a big language school?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Well, the instruction is just depending on the teacher I think, and right now I&#39;m the only full-time teacher and, you know, the guest teachers who do come, I know them personally so I know that the students always have a very qualified teacher and maybe that may be different because you know, sometimes at a big school it&#39;s hard to really
  <span class="audionotes">
   monitor the teachers
  </span>
  that you hire and even monitor what they are doing in the classroom.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Now, when you talk about a good quality teacher, for you what makes a good quality teacher?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Well, I think personality is very important for one thing, but also I think students need and want a teacher who has experience teaching English. Some of my friends back home tend to think it&#39;s easy to just be a native English speaker and teach English, which is really
  <span class="audionotes">
   not the case
  </span>
  , so I value an experienced teacher and someone who&#39;s also studied a little about it and has a
  <span class="audionotes">
   TEFL certificate
  </span>
  or something like that.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, good luck with your school, Conrad. I hope it&#39;s a big success.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Thanks, Todd. Thank very much.

 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 OK, Tini, you were saying that you enjoy being a student.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, I&#39;m a teacher. I have  a couple of questions for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  First one, what type of teacher do you like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  What type of teacher? Well, I would prefer a teacher who has like very high standards towards their students, but at the same time, very understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s interesting. So, by high standards, do you mean that they&#39;re very demanding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you think that the teacher should give difficult assignments and give lots of homework?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, demanding in the sense that probably because they know that the students can do more than, is more able, is able to do more but what they can do right at the moment, and probably in that way the teacher can, how do you say, develop the students more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Interesting. OK, so that&#39;s the most important thing is the teacher is somewhat demanding and
  <span class="audionotes">
   sets high expectations
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, I like teachers who are demanding but of course I give very much respect to teachers who actually care about their students and try to understand their students.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so they have empathy and understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, what about qualities you don&#39;t like in a teacher?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Qualities I don&#39;t like in a teacher? Favorites.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Favorites.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Favorites. You know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   teacher&#39;s pet
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, can you explain teacher&#39;s pet?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Teacher&#39;s pet is that, you know, sometimes teachers like one student more than the other students, and then so they give like, I don&#39;t know, like more attention to that student, and then they are nicer to that student, or. Yes, sometimes gives better grades. I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you think that maybe that&#39;s just
  <span class="audionotes">
   human nature
  </span>
  , that all teachers have favorites, or do you think some teachers, no matter what, treat everybody equally?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, I think that it also deals with experience, and you know, the period of time you are engaged teaching activities. I think, probably, initially, like, you know, like teacher, initially are human nature, we all have favorites, like we all have like people who we want to be around with and people who don&#39;t want to be around with. That is human nature, I think, but then like, probably,
  <span class="audionotes">
   as time goes by
  </span>
  , and as experience is gained, I think that, like if I&#39;m a teacher, I think I will gain a more, like
  <span class="audionotes">
   objective perspective
  </span>
  towards the student and teaching I guess
 </p>
