   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Kevin, we&#39;re back here in the forest. We&#39;re gonna talk about sports.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  OK. Great. I love sports.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What sports do you like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Well, my favorite sport is baseball. Obviously, I grew up and my father was a baseball player so I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   always around
  </span>
  baseball.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  My whole life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You mean your father was a player in the Major Leagues?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, exactly. Not only was he a player in the Major Leagues, he was
  <span class="audionotes">
   fortunate enough
  </span>
  to play in the World Series twice with the New York Mets.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, The Amazing Met&#39;s. 1969.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s great. Did you play baseball yourself?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I played baseball pretty much my whole life
  <span class="audionotes">
   up through
  </span>
  college and university.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Why did you stop?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Well, it wasn&#39;t exactly by choice. I wasn&#39;t drafted high enough in professional baseball to.. in order for me to sign, so I ended up retiring from baseball and pursuing other things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Great. Do you like any others sports?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I actually, I enjoy all competition. You know I enjoy  the other typical American sports of basketball and American football and so on, but I also try to learn about and enjoy the national sport of the countries that I&#39;m in. For example now I&#39;m in Japan and I&#39;ve actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   gotten quite into
  </span>
  Sumo wrestling.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nice. Have you ever
  <span class="audionotes">
   seen a sumo match live
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yes, I have. I&#39;ve been to two sumo
  <em>
   bashos
  </em>
  as they call them, or matches in Tokyo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nice. Yeah, I wanna go. I wanna go myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, let&#39;s go sometime.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Let&#39;s do it.
