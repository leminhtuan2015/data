The United States is speeding up the arrival of [an aircr...] a naval aircraft carrier strike group to the Arabian Sea.  This comes after concerns Iran may be planning an attack against American or allied targets.
<br><br>
Here is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaking to reporters from Finland.  "We have continued to see activity that leads us to believe that there's escalation that may be taking place, and so we're taking all the appropriate actions, both from a security perspective as well as our ability to make sure the president has a wide range of options in the event that something should actually take place."

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee moved Monday to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress.  The reason for refusing to turn over an unredacted copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
<br><br>
AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports it's unlikely that Barr would face criminal contempt charges.
<br><br>
If the House Judiciary Committee approves the contempt resolution, it would go to the full House and if approved there, a criminal referral would go to the U.S. attorney here in Washington, a Justice Department official likely to defend the attorney general.
<br><br>
The House held then-AG Eric Holder in contempt in 2012.  The department took no steps to prosecute him.
<br><br>
That was the AP's Sagar Meghani reporting.
<br><br>
The House panel's chairman said the committee would vote Wednesday on the contempt citation.

<br><br>
AP correspondent Jackie Quinn has more.
<br><br>
Investors were hoping the Trump administration was on the verge of resolving the long-running trade war with China and then the president warned of imposing tariffs as high as 25 percent.
<br><br>
Jacob Parker with the U.S.-China Business Council says this makes it tough for China's negotiators who are supposed to come to the U.S. for talks later this week.
<br><br>
"They have to contend with a domestic audience in China that would view this as a capitulation to the United States."
<br><br>
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett tells CNBC he is a little surprised President Trump took such a tough stance, but "with some people in negotiations, a, a, a, the best technique is to act half crazy.  The very fact that it's sort of a nuclear threat is what brings people to the table."
