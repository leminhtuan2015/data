  So tell me about how Rocky
  <span class="audionotes">
   is a survivor
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  So, Rocky is a survivor, for two reasons. One because of her surviving in the bushes, but... and that was only when she was really only a month old and we took her in. But she really earned her name last year, when she was about a year old, Rocky liked going out on my balcony, and I
  <span class="audionotes">
   used to
  </span>
  let her go out on my balcony with out a leash or without supervision and she decided that she
 </p>
 <p>
  wanted to see what was beyond the balcony, so she climbed up to the top of the balcony which was like a concrete wall and she jumped. When I, you know five minutes after I had noticed that she has jumped, I went looking for her all around my apartment building. This was probably at eleven o&#39;clock at night, and I couldn&#39;t find her anywhere, so I thought she had jumped to the roof next to my apartment building and she was out
  <span class="audionotes">
   hanging around
  </span>
  with other cats. I was very worried, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   it was dark
  </span>
  and I couldn&#39;t find her so I went to sleep. I woke up the next morning at five o&#39;clock, a very worried mother looking for my cat, and I noticed that she had fallen actually between my apartment building and the roof, the apartment building next to mine and wasn&#39;t moving, so I picked her up and I brought her to the hospital and
  <span class="audionotes">
   it turned out
  </span>
  that she had actually broken her pelvis bone, which means that she could move her two front paws but she could not move her back paws, so she basically couldn&#39;t walk at all.
