   Ah, it&#39;s great, so basically backpacking, but going between countries by train with some friends. I travelled with some friends, so you can buy one ticket. It&#39;s called an interrail ticket and you can visit any country in Europe using this one ticket. They last, well, the ticket I had lasted one month.

   In France we were on the South Coast, South of France. What did we do? Well, really we spent our time on the beach mainly playing water sports on the beach and just sunbathing and relaxing. (Cool) That kind of thing. Yep.

   We were lucky, We met some students, some British students who was studying Italian, and they had their own apartment on the hills, one of the hills in Florence, and they invited us to their apartment, so we stayed with them, and they had, they had built up some local knowledge. They knew about some local restaurants so they took us to a very traditional, whatchucallem, piatza, uh pizza restaurant, pizze, pizzu (Pizzeria!) Thank you. Yes. Um, and I think it was the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had. It was wonderful.
