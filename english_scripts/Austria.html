   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sarah, can you talk about your time in Austria?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Austria is, I worked for a language school where you go to a normal school in Austria for one week, and you take one particular year group and you teach them English for that one week, and then you move onto another school the next week so you&#39;re moving around every week, which is good because you get to go to Vienna and Insbruck, and you&#39;re constantly moving around the country, um, so it&#39;s an interesting lifestyle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s Vienna like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Ah, great. I like Vienna. It&#39;s very, very easy to get around. Um, very friendly place. The transition from England to Austria is very, a very easy one, and there&#39;s a lot to do in Vienna. Quite similar to London in that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like for example what things?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s very cultural and a lot of museums and art galleries. It&#39;s quite historical. It&#39;s an historical city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Can you tell a little about the history of Vienna or why it&#39;s historical?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  No
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No! I&#39;m sorry. That&#39;s a tough question. How about the food? How about Austrian food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t like Austrian food actually, I have to say. It&#39;s quite heavy. It&#39;s very heavy. A lot of sausages, a lot of meats. They&#39;re very much into their meats, but they also have a lot of Italian food because of course their on the border, so they have a lot of influence from other cultures, so they like curry , and Italian food as well, it&#39;s very, very big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And what&#39;s the landscape like in Vienna?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  In Vienna?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I mean, I&#39;m sorry, in Austria?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  The landscape is beautiful. That is one of the main reasons why I went there. It&#39;s very mountainous, and the Tirol, which is very beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sorry the Tirol?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  The Tirol. It&#39;s like um, like, it&#39;s just a long journey through the mountains that you go through. It&#39;s called the Tirol.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did you go hiking?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  No I went skiing a few times, not hiking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Good, good ski slopes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Very! Very good yeah!
