   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Shona, let&#39;s talk about shopping. What are things you don&#39;t like to go shopping for?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  The two things I don&#39;t like shopping for are food and shoes. And food because I just find it
  <span class="audionotes">
   incredibly boring
  </span>
  and I just like to get in and out of the supermarket as quickly as possible and just get what I need because I find it really like scary and weird to like how there are just so many items, like, that
  <span class="audionotes">
   I don&#39;t have a clue what they are
  </span>
  and they&#39;re all like there on the shelf. They&#39;re so many of the same thing. I just find it really weird. And the lighting in supermarkets. It is just too bright for me, and I just - everyone&#39;s walking around like
  <span class="audionotes">
   zombies with their trolleys
  </span>
  and I just find it very weird.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, it&#39;s funny you say that because I love shopping for food. In America, I love shopping for food because I can read the labels. In Japan, where we live now, it&#39;s not so fun because I can&#39;t read and it really
  <span class="audionotes">
   drives me nuts
  </span>
  , when I can&#39;t...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Exactly. Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Shoes I cannot shop for because I have like quite big feet. I&#39;ve got like a size eight, which is like a forty. I think it is a forty-one. I think it&#39;s quite big for a girl, and I always see like really pretty shoes I really want, but they just don&#39;t fit my big feet, so it&#39;s like a big disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, you know it&#39;s funny you mentioned about the shoe size because, you know, if the United Nations does anything, they should make
  <span class="audionotes">
   a universal shoe size
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and like dress sizes as well. It&#39;s like really confusing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like, everytime you buy shoes, it will say, &#34; UK 12, USA 10, International 6&#34; or whatever and it&#39;s always really confusing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  I know exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so you don&#39;t like food. You don&#39;t like shoes. Anything else you don&#39;t like to shop for?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t like to shop for technical things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  No. It&#39;s good for like some people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I love that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Especially male. I&#39;m not being like sexist, but for me shopping for technical stuff is just so boring and it confuses me on end.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, that&#39;s probably what I like to shop for the most. I think it&#39;s fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  I can tell, actually. No, I just, I hardly ever need to get anything that&#39;s like too technical. If I do, like, I&#39;ll just ask someone else&#39;s advice because I just don&#39;t have a clue.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, but you have a computer right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  I have one, yeah. I have a laptop.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you have an MP3 player?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but these things have both been bought for me. I didn&#39;t buy them myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so that&#39;s why. A hair dyer, like I don&#39;t mind buying something like that but anything technical and it&#39;s just I&#39;m not going to enjoy shopping for it.
