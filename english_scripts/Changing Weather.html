   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So you do winter camping and the place you live, do you get a lot of snow there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  We get quite a bit of snow but it&#39;s mostly just up in the mountains.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So, lately there&#39;s been a lot of talk about
  <span class="audionotes">
   global warming
  </span>
  . So where you live, do you find that you can see the affects global warming, say with less snow?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I think you can. I think there&#39;s been less snow. That is
  <span class="audionotes">
   not quite as
  </span>
  noticeable as the glaciers that are on the mountains have gotten smaller and smaller, so I think there has been less snow although it&#39;s not real noticeable cause ski resorts are still open and there&#39;s still snow out there but to snow shoe but every summer the glaciers seem to be getting smaller and smaller.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So you are about - what - 35 now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Ah, younger than that actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Really. So in your thirties, but when you were a boy, when you were young like 5 or 6 and you were playing in the snow, was there more snow back then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I think there probably was. One thing is - I told you the snow is in the mountain - and
  <span class="audionotes">
   there used to be
  </span>
  a lot more snow in the valley where I live and
  <span class="audionotes">
   I can&#39;t remember the last time
  </span>
  we got snow in the valley.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Really! So global warming, you think may be is getting worse?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I would say so. I think one of the biggest affects is we seem to be getting more rain actually. The weather patterns have switched a little bit and it seems like
  <span class="audionotes">
   it&#39;s been dumping rain
  </span>
  . There&#39;s been more flooding, so we&#39;re actually getting more rain and less snow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. OK. Interesting.
