 <strong>
  Tom:
 </strong>
 We&#39;re both English teachers. Is there anything you hate about teaching English?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s actually not much that I hate about teaching English but there is one thing which
  <span class="audionotes">
   drives me balmy
  </span>
  , and annoys me more than anything else and that&#39;s correcting the same mistake
  <span class="audionotes">
   over, and over, and over again
  </span>
  , and it seems that every country in which I&#39;ve worked, every nationality in English learners have one mistake that they always make over and over again. In Hungary, when you say how are you to a Hungarian student, they&#39;ll reply in English, I&#39;m feeling myself well, which is a
  <span class="audionotes">
   direct translation
  </span>
  from Hungarian but sounds rather strange and a little bit rude in English, and I must have corrected that mistake millions of times while I was there. The same students again and again and again and again, so the repetition of making the same correction really
  <span class="audionotes">
   gets my goat
  </span>
  . How about you? What do you hate about teaching?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  I really wouldn&#39;t say I hate something about teaching, but I definitely think there are things that waste my time when I&#39;m teaching. After every lesson, I very carefully right up a lesson plan, bring all those materials together, put it in a little plastic wallet and store it away in a folder, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   I know full well
  </span>
  I will never open that folder to read about that lesson again. I kind of approach every lesson as fresh and new and try and come up with something different and every time I&#39;m writing them all up, doing all this paperwork and I really don&#39;t need to. I need to get in control of myself and stop doing that. You told me what you most dislike about teaching, but I&#39;m sure you love this job. What are some things you like about English teaching?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  I think the thing I like the most about teaching is what I call the &#34;Ah-hah&#34; moment when you&#39;re studying a language point with a class or a student and you can almost see physically the moment they understand, they moment they&#39;re able to make sense of the language of they can do the task that you&#39;ve asked them to do, and you can almost see a light bulb go off above their head, &#34;Ah-hah! Now I understand.&#34; and I love that. I love the
  <span class="audionotes">
   surge of confidence
  </span>
  that gives the students and also makes me feel really good that I helped them to reach that point. What do you love about teaching Tom?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  The thing I really love is right at the end of the course, when the students come up to you after a long time of haranguing about homework and about being late and about correction and drilling and the students come up and say, &#34;Teacher, we&#39;re all going to dinner at the end of the course. Do you want to come with us?&#34; and that must makes me smile. Now, I know I saying this to you Jess, but I know there&#39;s a lot of people out there listening to this. It really makes my heart warm to go and have some social time with the students at the end of a long course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  So the thing you like most about teaching is when the teaching is finished?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  Oh,
  <span class="audionotes">
   you&#39;ve got me on that one
  </span>
  , yes.
 </p>
