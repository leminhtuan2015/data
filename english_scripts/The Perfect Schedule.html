   Rory
  </b>
  : So I was thinking about my current job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Uh-hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : And I think like my work schedule is so good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : I work Monday and Tuesday, then I have a day off. Then I work Thursday and Friday, and then I have the weekend off. And I get five months holiday, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Sign me up
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : So I mean, what’s a good work schedule for you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : I think what you’ve just described sounds really good as well. When I was younger actually, I don’t know where this idea came from but my ideal work hours were 9:00 until 2:00.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Not 9:00 until 5:00 like you usually hear in a lot of Western countries, but 9 o’clock to 2 o’clock.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : I don’t know. So maybe for me, if I could do it, if I could find something like that, it would be really good because you can sleep in until maybe 7:00 or 8:00, go to work, finish at 2:00, still come back and have a good
  <span class="audionotes">
   chunk
  </span>
  of that day to do other things. So…
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah. So my previous job was quite – I started at 9:30 and I finish at 12:30. I worked five days a week but it was great because work was finished by lunch time. I had the whole day free. And that was a good job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : And you still got a full time salary?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : And that was a full-time salary, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow. Sounds even better than this one, maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah. In the past – I mean, I’ve worked in restaurants where you work only in the evenings. So I’d start at 5:30 and work until around midnight. I didn’t like that as much because all day, I was thinking, “I’ve got to go to work later.” So I think I prefer working in the morning and
  <span class="audionotes">
   get it behind me
  </span>
  as soon as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : I think maybe I’m the same way as well. I prefer to get it down and then have the rest of the day to enjoy. Also, I had a job where I was working during the weekend. And I would have Mondays and Tuesdays off. And I didn’t really like that. I missed seeing friends on the weekend and then
  <span class="audionotes">
   going out
  </span>
  . So I don’t think I would like anything like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  How about not working? Do you think – how long do you think you could go without not having to work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Well, it’s funny because this job now I have really long vacations but I’m not happy when I’m not working. Like my wife gets very frustrated with me because if I have nothing to do, I tend to be a bit annoying around the house, just getting
  <span class="audionotes">
   depressed
  </span>
  , just arguing all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I don’t need much work. Like if I could just do like an hour a day, I think that would be enough to make me happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Okay. How long could you go would say? A week or two without having to touch work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : I could probably go a couple of months.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Okay. Without having to work at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah, if I have other things to do, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : All right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : So if I had other projects like if I was doing a lot of training for running or if I was studying, if I had a good book then I could probably go quite a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Yeah. I get pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   restless
  </span>
  myself, too. I think after three, four days of not having anything to do, I just want – I really need something. Maybe, like you said study or learn or go out and do something, have a project, have a goal. I think, yeah, my personality type needs to constantly do something, produce. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah. When I worked in Europe, I used to do – I used to teach for one or two weeks intensively, and then have three or four weeks off. And it was quite nice because I had lots of free time but after two or three weeks of free time, I was quite looking forward to the next block, the next block of teaching.
  <br>
  But teaching these intensive blocks can be quite – it can be quite tough as well. Like I have to – I did a six-week block in Russia once, and after three weeks, I just wanted to go home.
 </p>
 <p>
  Six weeks was too long.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow. I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : How intensive was it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Well, the job in Russia was really intensive because I was living with the students in a residential university. And so we had breakfast together and then I taught them from half past eight in the morning until half past six in the evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : We had lunch together, and then we had dinner together in the evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : And there was one bar in the university, and we all went to the same bar in the evening as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : And you had the same group of students?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : The same group of students.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : For six weeks?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : For six weeks and it was six days a week of teaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow. I can – if you the teacher felt like that, I can only imagine how the students must have felt. They must have wanted a break badly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah. We all wanted a break.
