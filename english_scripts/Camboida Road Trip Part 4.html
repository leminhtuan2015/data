  Todd
 </strong>
 : So on your bike trip, how did you feed yourself. What did you eat?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  :
  <span class="audionotes">
   Hydration
  </span>
  was a thing that we worried about. We were able to stop every few kilometres and get fresh young coconuts with the straw in the top. Did you remember doing that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yes, that&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s like a natural IV hit straight there. You can get, you can live very well just
  <span class="audionotes">
   roadside stalls
  </span>
  . Breakfast on the street markets. Most Cambodians eat breakfast on the way to work. Like they gather at the market and there&#39;s people there selling noodles and the most incredible just homemade stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So what was a typical breakfast?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Noodles, usually noodles, some kind of noodles in a soup, like noodle soup I guess probably like in Vietnam, pho, they call it. The Cambodians have a similar thing. A lot of dishes with coconut milk, not as spicy as Thai food but a lot of coriander we call it in the UK. You call it, what do you call it, cilantro, you call it in America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It sounds good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Fabulous, yes, coconut.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I would imagine a lot of fruit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Let&#39;s see. In Cambodia did we get a lot of fruit. Not that much fruit actually in Cambodia. In Vietnam I remember the mangoes. When we crossed the border it was very different even though they&#39;re neighboring countries, it was a very different kind of cuisine when we crossed into Vietnam. Palm sugar, cane sugar, we drank a lot of cane sugar, cane sugar drink.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So during the day how many times would you usually eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : We&#39;d eat breakfast, usually within the first hour. Oh, the coffee. I remember the coffee. Coffee is made with condensed milk in Cambodia so that was a
  <span class="audionotes">
   staple
  </span>
  , a big shot of Cambodian coffee with condensed milk in it. We&#39;d have breakfast. We would try and do the
  <span class="audionotes">
   bulk
  </span>
  of our riding, we&#39;d try and do like sixty K if possible before lunch because it got too hot in the afternoons and we wanted to arrive wherever we were getting before dark because we didn&#39;t really, you know the roads weren&#39;t safe. And then we&#39;d stop for lunch somewhere but we&#39;d also make it a rest stop and because we didn&#39;t all cycle at the same
  <span class="audionotes">
   pace
  </span>
  , it would probably be about two hours or so by the time we all arrived in the same place. Ate lunch, again rice is a staple and then whatever they had going these lunchtime cafes. And then our evening meal would be probably when we arrived at our guesthouse or the town that we were at in the evening. So we would have three meals a day usually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And then at night you would just stay in a guesthouse?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : At night we&#39;d usually stay, yeah, we stayed in guesthouses, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So how did you feel when you finally reached the end of your trip?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Both
  <span class="audionotes">
   elated
  </span>
  and saddened. It was a real sense of achievement that we&#39;d made it but I wanted it to go on forever. I then had to fly back out from Ho Chi Minh. We had a few days in Ho Chi Minh just to kind of celebrate that we got to the end but I had to come back to Japan so I flew back via Bangkok, where my husband was actually waiting. I&#39;d been away two months so it was nice to come home. You know I realized when I got to the end that I really missed my husband but during the trip I was very at peace and enjoyed it and I could have just gone on forever I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Cycle around the world?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Cycle around the world, yeah. I realized that yeah that&#39;s how you do it. It&#39;s so pleasurable to do it to ride.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It sounds like an incredible trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : It was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll never forget it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : No, never, no, no, no.
