  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Gabrielle, you are a vegetarian.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you do not eat meat!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t. No meat, no fish!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and you said that you have a garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;m lucky to have enough room to have a vegetable garden, as well as a flower garden, so I love growing veggies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice! Can you tell us about your garden and what you grow and what you eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Sure absolutely! Well, I guess in the summertime, I grow a lot of salad vegetables:
  <br>
  lettuce, green onions, tomatoes, and over the winter, whatever grows pretty much, carrots or cabbages, broccoli.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, you grow vegetables all year round!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  I try. I try. I&#39;m not a great gardener. Yeah, so!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And what things do you like to make with these vegetable?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Ah, in the summer time I love just raw vegetables, so salads are great, and I eat them with Tofu or, yeah, vegetables are good. (OK) Yeah in winter soups. I love making soup with fresh veggies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, what kind of soup?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t follow recipes actually, so what ever veggies I have go in the pot. Yeah, tomato soup, corn soup&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sounds good. How do you make soup?I mean what is your procedure?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  OK, well, basically I take whatever vegetables I have, chop them up and cook them, boil them lightly. I like them still crunchy and then I often add a base of some sort, a stock, a veggie stock.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now that&#39;s normally a problem for vegetarians right, cause you can&#39;t use bullion, (Yeah) the beef cube or the chicken cube.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Sure, at home actually, we have a lot of vegetarian products available so I get some organic veggie stock, or alternatively, I use some spices, some cumin or basil spice, yeah, or sometimes lentils I cook up. Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re making me hungry. Sounds good. Well, thanks a lot, Gabrielle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  No, problem, you&#39;re welcome.
 </p>
