  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So Todd, I heard that you’re from San Francisco and that it’s really expensive there maybe to live. Is it – is that true?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It’s ridiculously expensive. It’s obscene actually. It’s so hard to get other people to realize how expensive it is. You have to actually live there and then you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   experience it firsthand
  </span>
  .
  <br>
  But basically, you know, your average small apartment is a minimum, a minimum of like $3,000 a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow. That sounds really expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Well, so I don’t know much about the San Francisco area. Is that like just in the main downtown part or anywhere in the city is it that expensive?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It’s actually – yeah, it’s pretty much the entire peninsula. And the high pricing affects all of Northern California. And the reason is because companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Yahoo, Cisco – all these really big rich, rich companies pay people a lot of money. And so, there’s a lot of money in San Francisco for the tech world, and that just
  <span class="audionotes">
   drives up the prices
  </span>
  for everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So everyone who lives there like must be pretty rich?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So it’s very high income. I think the average income is over $100,000 a year or something crazy like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it’s a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So if apartments are $3,000 a month, what about houses?
 </p>
 <p>
  Todd: Houses are
  <span class="audionotes">
   ridiculously expensive
  </span>
  . So your average house is probably – in San Francisco, a really small rinky-dink house can go for almost $1 million.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow. That sounds impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It sounds
  <span class="audionotes">
   obscene
  </span>
  . Yeah. Years ago I worked on the construction crew, and this was 15 years ago. And we were just renovating or painting a very small little shack. I mean, the house wasn’t even that big and it was going for $1 million.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow. So when you were working there, were you living in San Francisco also?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I was. And that’s actually why I became a teacher in Asia, why I moved to Japan because we were losing our lease on our apartment, and I had to go find new housing. And not only is the house inexpensive but even if you have the money, you might not get a house because you have to go through this
  <span class="audionotes">
   long process
  </span>
  . It’s almost like getting into college.
 </p>
 <p>
  You have to get through this interview process. And just going and finding an apartment is such a complicated process in San Francisco that I thought, “Oh, forget it, I’m just going to take the easy way out and go back and start teaching overseas again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So if someone were interested in living in San Francisco, what would your advice be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Don’t, or make sure you have a lot of money or you have a really good job. I guess
  <span class="audionotes">
   there are some ways around it
  </span>
  . You can rent rooms and things like that. But it’s doable because there is low-income housing. And if you live in the outskirts and if you are going to commute into the city, you could probably find something around $1,500 a month. But still, it’s pretty expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So work for Google first, then move to San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. Exactly. Make sure you get that job at the tech company. And then once you have that job, then you’re set.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Great. Well, thanks for sharing about San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Sure.
