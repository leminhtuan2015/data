   </strong>
   Hey, Ruth
   <strong>
    ,
   </strong>
   how are you at cooking? Are you any good?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Not really if I&#39;m honest.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, OK. Well, is there a one recipe that you know how cook really well?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   There is actually. It&#39;s chocolate cheesecake.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Wow! That sounds really good. So what kind of
   <span class="audionotes">
    ingredients
   </span>
   are in this chocolate cheesecake that you&#39;re talking about?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, you need chocolate spread, digested buscuits,
   <span class="audionotes">
    condensed
   </span>
   milk, and you also need cream too.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Wow! And where can you buy these things?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, normally I buy them in the supermarket. It&#39;s quite convenient.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   OK, and it&#39;s pretty easy to find?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Very easy to find. All of these ingredients.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   And what kind of
   <span class="audionotes">
    utensils
   </span>
   or equipment do you need to make this cake?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, you need a baking tin, which has got an open bottom and you also need a whisk and you need a bowl and you need a fork, and other than that I think that&#39;s about it.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   I see.....Now, how do you get started with this recipe? What do you do first?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   The first thing that you do is you crush the digested biscuits, and so that they&#39;re like crumbled, and then you heat the butter, and you add the butter to the digested biscuits.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   OK, well that sounds easy enough. And what do you do next?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well then you leave that in the fridge for a day, then when you come back to it, you
   <span class="audionotes">
    whisk
   </span>
   the cream, you whip it up, and then you add the condensed milk to the cream with the fork very slowly, you fold it in.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, fold it in. Is that hard to do?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   It&#39;s quite, yeah, it involves skill. It&#39;s quite delicate.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   OK. Is that it? Is there any other steps?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, then you need to heat the chocolate spread up and you need to add it to the top and
   <span class="audionotes">
    fold
   </span>
   that in as well.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   And it&#39;s done?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   And then that&#39;s the end of the cheesecake.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, OK. Now, with this recipe is there anything you need to be careful of?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Not really, I mean it&#39;s quite easy, but the main thing is that you leave the digested mixture in the fridge for long enough, and then after the whole cheesecake is ready, you still have to put it back in the fridge. I&#39;m always tempted to eat it immediately, but you have to wait a few hours for it to cool.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, that sounds great. Thanks Ruth.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>

   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   OK.
