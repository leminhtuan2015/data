   Katie
  </strong>
  : So I don&#39;t really
 </p>
 <p>
  know much about Venezuela in terms of the different regions and things. So could you tell me something about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Well, in terms of weather we have only two seasons. We have a rainy season and the rest is dry. But so, you get to enjoy the four seasons in a way if you go to the west side of the country. We have like high mountains and you can see some snow and also, like it&#39;s a little bit cold over there.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if you go to the middle, in the middle of the country, the center, is hot. It&#39;s quite hot and dry. So it&#39;s where the â€“ it&#39;s like the cowboys&#39; area in Venezuela. So a lot of horses and they eat a lot of meat.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a little bit of north, in
  <span class="audionotes">
   facing
  </span>
  the Caribbean Sea, is the capital, Caracas. There, we have a very nice weather. I guess, that&#39;s the reason why it&#39;s the capital, maybe because the weather is really nice. We can wear the same clothes the whole year around.
 </p>

   Katie
  </strong>
  : What&#39;s the average temperature in Caracas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : While the, all this weather reports would say like 30, 35 and people will be like, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s really, really hot.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s not. When you&#39;re there, you feel like probably 27 is like the body temperature, probably.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Still pretty hot though, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : It is but it&#39;s dry. It&#39;s not so humid. Even though we are close to the Caribbean Sea, it&#39;s not so
  <span class="audionotes">
   humid
  </span>
  . So it&#39;s a very nice weather. Yeah. I really like it. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : So, outside of Caracas, are there any other famous cities in Venezuela?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gilda
  </strong>
  : Yes. There is one called Maracaibo. This is famous. It&#39;s the oil city. Venezuela is famous for having a lot of petroleum, and that&#39;s the city where all, most of the
  <span class="audionotes">
   petroleum
  </span>
  is
  <span class="audionotes">
   concentrated
  </span>
  and all the companies, oil companies. And since they have oil, the city is pretty modern and, yeah. So it&#39;s another major city in the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is another city that is kind of developing now is in the middle of the country. It&#39;s called Valencia. And also, it&#39;s famous because it has lots of
  <span class="audionotes">
   industries
  </span>
  and factories. So many people are moving there for job opportunities. And yeah, they have very nice places as well. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Are there any
  <span class="audionotes">
   resort towns
  </span>
  in Venezuela?
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilda: Yes, there are many especially because Venezuela is facing the Caribbean Sea. So there are many places for enjoying to see the ocean, beach side. There is an island called Margarita island. It&#39;s also very famous for occasion like to enjoy the summer at the fullest, and it&#39;s famous. That city has a lot of foreigners, visitors, yeah, all year around.
