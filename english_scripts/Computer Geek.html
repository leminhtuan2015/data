   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Todd, why do you have three computers?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I know. It&#39;s crazy. I do have three computers. Before, I had four computers. Now, I only have three computers.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have three computers because I use computers for my job. So I have one computer for my house. One laptop computer for my house. And I always keep that computer at my house. So it&#39;s heavy. It&#39;s a MacBook Pro. And I don&#39;t like to carry it, so I leave it home. And I have a MacBook Air. It&#39;s very light. It&#39;s not heavy. And I use my MacBook Air when I travel, when I go to school, when I go downtown to a caf√©.
 </p>
 <p>
  So yeah, I have one computer for home and one computer for when I travel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : And how about the other one?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, the other computer. The other computer is old. It&#39;s also a MacBook Pro, and it&#39;s seven years old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It still works. It works really well but I use it as a backup computer. So sometimes, I need a computer in case one computer fails. Also, sometimes my friends need a computer and I lend my computer to my friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s easy. I like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : What do you do if you need something that&#39;s on the other computer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, I use cloud computing, so I use Dropbox. So Dropbox shares everything. So all computers are linked and they share all the files. So it&#39;s no problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : How about phones? How many do you have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I have three phones, also for my job. I have an iPhone. I have a Samsung Galaxy. And I have a Nokia Windows phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Which one do you like the best?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Hmm, that&#39;s tough. I think I like the Samsung Galaxy the best because it&#39;s bigger and it&#39;s easy to read. But the iPhone has good apps. I like the apps on the iPhone, and the iPhone is very reliable. So it always works.
 </p>
 <p>
  So yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : How about the Nokia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : The Nokia is also a good phone. It&#39;s a Windows phone, and I travel a lot so when I travel, I always take the Nokia phone and I use a new sim card in the country, and that is my phone when I travel.
 </p>
 <p>
  I usually leave my Galaxy phone or my iPhone at home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : You say you use your phone for work. How?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So I create websites and so I need to check how websites look on different phones. So every time I make a website, I check it on the Nokia phone. I check it on the Samsung phone. I check on the iPhone. So I make sure the website works on all smartphones.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Does the website often have problems with one phone or a different phone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Usually not. Usually, everything is okay. But sometimes, media files like audio files or video files do not work on the phones. So sometimes, I have to change things. But usually, it works.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Ah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : How about you? How many computers do you have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Well, at home, we have one laptop. And it&#39;s kind of big, so I don&#39;t usually take it out with me. And then we have a personal computer, and we also have a tablet, an iPad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : And I don&#39;t use the iPad very much. It&#39;s usually used by my daughter. She&#39;s two, and she loves to play games on the iPad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : So it&#39;s an expensive toy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So your daughter likes the iPad, you like the laptop.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I like the laptop, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And the personal computer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : The personal computer is my husbands. And we also use it as the family computer when we want to watch a movie or watch a TV show. Something like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh wow. Sounds good. And phones?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Phones. Well, I have my own phone. I have Sony phone. It&#39;s an Xperia. And I like it. It&#39;s big, so sometimes my fingers can&#39;t reach all the buttons but I can watch videos on it. I like that. And when I leave the country, I can&#39;t use it in other countries. But I can use the Wi-Fi. So that&#39;s convenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that is convenient. Okay. Thanks a lot, Sarah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Thank you.
