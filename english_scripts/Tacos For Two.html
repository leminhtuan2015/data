  Daniel:
 </strong>
 Hey Olga, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Hi, and how are you Daniel?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m fine thanks. I need to ask you a favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Sure, what&#39;s up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Well I&#39;m trying to
  <span class="audionotes">
   impress
  </span>
  a girl and I need to cook something for her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  So I was thinking of Mexican food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s a good option.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  What can you recommend me?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Why don&#39;t you cook tacos?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s fairly simple and I think you can do it. Can you get tortillas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I might be able to get them but I&#39;m not really sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Well if you get them then I can just cook the meat, you know. It&#39;s really easy, like in a pan, a fry pan, you just fry it with onion, salt, pepper, and maybe a little bit of chilli peppper. Do you like it hot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I would rather not to have it that hot. It&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   the first date
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but you know it&#39;s romantic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Maybe just a bit. So yeah you just cut a little bit of chilli pepper and put it inside and when you&#39;ve made this you just put it inside a tortilla,
  <span class="audionotes">
   wrap
  </span>
  it and maybe put some salad like lettuce and tomato on top with a little bit of cream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK, what kind of cream?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  The one that&#39;s not sweet, you know the natural cream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  That white one?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Yeah, right and are you sure about the tortillas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Just explain me so
  <span class="audionotes">
   in case
  </span>
  I cannot get them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Just get corn flour.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Corn flour?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think you can get it anywhere or at least on the internet and you just mix it with some water and maybe a little bit of salt and make like a...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Pastry?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Yeah and just take a little round ball the size that you can hold it in your hand and you know like
  <span class="audionotes">
   extend
  </span>
  it to make the shape of the tortilla and just heat it up in the pan without any oil or anything and it&#39;s done like in one minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Wow that&#39;s really easy. You think it&#39;s going to work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
