  </strong>
  Now, Barbara, it&#39;s really good to see you. I heard that you were in the hospital.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  Yes, I was. I got sick in august last year and luckily I was with my students and the lady was a nurse. She and her husband drove me to the hospital. I was doubled over. I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   clutching my stomach
  </span>
  . I had so much pain, a burning sensation in my chest. I didn&#39;t know what was happening. They took me to the hospital and they did some tests and they said, “ Well, you have gallstones.”

  Gallstones. What exactly are gallstones?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  Well, next to your stomach, there is an organ called the
  <span class="audionotes">
   gall bladder
  </span>
  and the job of this organ is to hold some liquid which comes out of your liver and this liquid stays in your gallbladder and is saved for when it&#39; needed, and when you eat something that contains fat or oil, the bile from the gallbladder is
  <span class="audionotes">
   squirted out
  </span>
  and goes into, perhaps your stomach or your intestine. I&#39;m not sure which, and there it does something to
  <span class="audionotes">
   help you to cope
  </span>
  with the oil. Perhaps it binds with the oil or makes it easier for your body to get rid of it – to eliminate it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so when you have these gallstones, do they give you medicine? Do they remove them through surgery?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  There are a couple of different things to do. My gallbladder was working too hard because I was eating an unhealthy diet and not exercising enough, so inside my gallbladder, there were too big hard stones. Some people can have surgery to remove them. Some people have
  <span class="audionotes">
   laser surgery
  </span>
  , where the doctors aim a laser at the stones and shatter them, but the small pieces are still there and they have to be passed out of the body naturally and that is still a problem. With me, my gallbladder was inflamed and they looked at it and said, “No, it has to come out” so they took out the whole thing: the gallbladder and the two stones inside it. So now I have no gallbladder, so if I eat oily food… well I have no gallbladder to contain the bile from my liver which I need to process the oil.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  So, if I eat anything with oil I feel sick, and I usually… yeah, it&#39;s not good. So, I avoid oil, which is healthier anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m just glad that you&#39;re OK. That sound pretty awful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  Oh, well, I&#39;m fit now. Yeah, everything&#39;s OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, good to hear.
