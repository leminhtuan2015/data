   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Matt, I thought we would talk about people that we admire and the qualities about them that we admire. So, first we&#39;re both sports fans. Who is an athlete that you admire?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Athlete that I admire? I would have to say Jackie Robinson, would come to mind, just because
  <span class="audionotes">
   the barriers he had to overcome
  </span>
  and the things that he experienced, that people after him...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, can you... a lot of people might not know who Jackie Robinson is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Oh, sure, yeah, I&#39;m sorry. Jackie Robinson was the first black man, the first man
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    to break the quote-unquote color barrier
   </span>
  </span>
  in baseball and he was in 1947 brought in to the Major Leagues from the Negro Leagues which were at that time the only place where blacks or colored athletes were allowed to play baseball, so the first three years
  <span class="audionotes">
   he endured an enormous amount of racism
  </span>
  and hatred and he had to basically
  <span class="audionotes">
   bite his lip
  </span>
  and wasn&#39;t able to seek revenge or fight for three years, so yeah, just what he went through, above and beyond just playing the game was something that I always admired in him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, a special guy. Definitely. How about in movies is there an actor that you admire?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  You know, I mean, I love so many actors and actresses in different roles. I think just in the interviews that I&#39;ve seen, I really like Johnny Depp because he can play different characters and he&#39;s not afraid to play off the wall characters or even bit parts or small roles that other main actors probably would not be interested in and he definitely, he brings humor to every dramatic role that he does. And just being in LA, I had a chance to see him film the movie Blow for about a week and just to see his demeanor on and off the set and he was not superficial or tough to deal with at all just from an outside perspective, he seemed like a really
  <span class="audionotes">
   down-to-earth
  </span>
  ,  cool guy, so I&#39;ve always admired him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, what is your favorite Johnny Depp movie?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  I&#39;d have to say, well, the first Pirate, Pirate&#39;s of the Caribbean Movie, the first one was fantastic, his role in that, and yeah, that&#39;s probably my favorite.
