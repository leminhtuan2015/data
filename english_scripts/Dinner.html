    Akane:
   </strong>
   Hey, Ruth.

   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Hey, Akane.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   I just came to pick up my plastic container than I lent you the other day.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, right. Well, I&#39;ve just washed it actually, so here you go.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Thanks. So did you like that potato salad I made you?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   It was really nice. Yeah, it was really nice. I&#39;m not sure how you made it, but I enjoyed it.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah, I gave some to Todd as well and he really liked it too.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, good, I&#39;m glad he liked it. That&#39;s good.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah. I made some stuffed peppers too, but unfortunately there&#39;s meat in it, so..
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, no. That&#39;s a shame. I would have really liked some of those, too.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah. I gave it to Todd and he really liked it.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Really.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   You&#39;re such a good cook. I wish I could cook like you can.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a few tricks up your sleeve as well.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve yet to discover them.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   So do you want to go out for dinner again this Saturday?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, that sounds like a really good idea.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Um, last time, last week I think we went to &#34;Joyful&#34;, right?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yeah, that&#39;s right. We had rice and things like that. Is that right?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Mm-hm, and I think I might of had a hamburger, or something like that.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, yes, you did.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So, where do you think we should go this time?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Uh, I don&#39;t know. Do you want to go for sushi again?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, I really like sushi. Yeah.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah, there&#39;s that, that other store, the sushi shop that we haven&#39;t gone to yet.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Ok, well, we could go there because that would be a nice walk as well.
   <br>
   We could walk there and walk back and we could get some exercise at the same time.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, that&#39;s a great idea.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yeah, and then we wouldn&#39;t feel so bad when we&#39;re greedy.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Hm, for sure.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Why don&#39;t you go and ask Todd, and find out if he wants to go..
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   OK.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   And then we&#39;ll organize it for tomorrow night.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Great idea.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, excellent. Oh, and Akane?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah!
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   You know, if you&#39;re making anymore potato salad,..
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Mm-hm?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Feel free to bring some around.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Sure. No problem.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Alright. Bye-bye.
