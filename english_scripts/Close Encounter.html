 : OK, so Jeff, we&#39;ve been talking a little bit about your travel kind of experiences and stuff, and one other question I wanted to ask you, is there a time where you experienced something really weird, or something strange that happened in your travels around the world? Is there something that stands out in your memory?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : Many weird things happen when you&#39;re traveling. I think that&#39;s the beauty about traveling is it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   an emotional roller coaster
  </span>
  but I remember one time, again it was in India because it&#39;s a country full of surprises, but I was driving on a old
  <span class="audionotes">
   rickety
  </span>
  bus. We were going down the road and we stopped, and I was sitting by the window, and a bus is full of action and noise and everything so I was paying attention inside the bus, and when the bus came to a stop at the intersection I turned around and looked out the window and there was an elephant staring right about me. The big eye of an elephant at the same level as the bus window looking right at me, and it was such a shock to me that, you know, you&#39;re in the middle of a big city in India and you&#39;re one a crowded bus and you turn around and look outside, and there&#39;s this big elephant looking at you. Well, you expect to see that in the zoo, but not out in the streets so I must say it was very weird and wonderful experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Did you
  <span class="audionotes">
   strike up a conversation
  </span>
  with the elephant?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : Actually, there was a man sitting on top of the elephant, so I had a
  <span class="audionotes">
   quick chat
  </span>
  with him and then the bus went on and we left the elephant and that was it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And you have --- India you have cows in the streets, and you have donkeys, and you have dogs and cats. It&#39;s a very animal friendly place, and I knew that they had elephants, but I hadn&#39;t seen one
  <span class="audionotes">
   at that point
  </span>
  in the street, so, and I expected to see one my first time from a distance. I didn&#39;t expect to be eye-to-eye with one the first time I saw one, and elephants have quite big eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : I heard that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : So, but it was a very good and elephants are lovely animals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : You didn&#39;t poke him in the eye?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : I didn&#39;t poke him in the eye
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s a good thing. Fantastic.
