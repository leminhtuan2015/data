  : Hey, Hana how are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m fine thank you. How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m fine thanks. So tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yes, I heard it&#39;s going to be a really nice day on Saturday, so I&#39;m planning to go to the beach with my friends. The beach is three hours away so we are going to go by car, and we are planning to have a barbecue, and I&#39;m very excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : In the evening we&#39;re going to have fireworks, so it&#39;s going to be very beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : So, are you going to stay over at the beach?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : No, we&#39;re going to come back so we&#39;ll be home quite late.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : So then what are you going to do on Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : I think I&#39;ll be sleeping all morning and probably in the afternoon I&#39;m going to study because I have a maths exam on Monday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Oh, well, that&#39;s a shame. Well, I think I&#39;m going to wish you good luck on your exam.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Have fun at the beach.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Thank you.
