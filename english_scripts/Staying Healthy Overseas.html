   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now Keren, we&#39;re talking about staying healthy, and you live overseas,, and we both know
  <span class="audionotes">
   it&#39;s quite hard
  </span>
  to actually sometimes stay healthy overseas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  First of all, can you talk about Spain? When you lived in Spain was it easy to stay healthy in Spain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Actually, it&#39;s reasonably easy to stay healthy in Spain. The weather&#39;s always good and I like jogging so I always had the opportunity to go jogging outside and there&#39;s lots of beautiful areas to go jogging along the river or along the beach so it was
  <span class="audionotes">
   relatively easy
  </span>
  there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And where did you live in Spain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I lived in Seville and Barcelona.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Very nice. OK, now how about Peru? Now you lived in Peru, correct? Where did you live?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I lived in Lima.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And was it easy to keep a healthy lifestyle in Peru?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Well, actually the fruit and vegetables are extremely cheap so, and fruit drinks are really, really popular in Peru. Everybody has their own
  <span class="audionotes">
   food processor
  </span>
  to make fruit drinks so in terms of food you can stay really, really healthy, really easily. And there&#39;s also lots of gyms in Lima actually. Going to the gym is very popular there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, what about Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Japan is kind of the
  <span class="audionotes">
   opposite
  </span>
  of Peru because I find the fruit and vegetables very, very expensive and so I tend not to buy fruit, only bananas, and I can&#39;t believe how expensive the tomatoes cost.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
  <span class="audionotes">
   It is crazy
  </span>
  , the prices.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s incredible, and it rains a lot in Japan, I think so it makes it more difficult to go jogging.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and just lastly, how about back home in England, is it very easy for you to stay healthy in England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I suppose the average English diet is not so healthy. We tend to like our fatty puddings and fatty foods but there&#39;s lots of free or cheap places to do exercise. There&#39;s many swimming pools and many gyms so, yeah, if you have the right attitude, it&#39;s easy to stay healthy there. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, thanks Keren.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s OK.
