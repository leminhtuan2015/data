   Todd:
  </strong>
  So actually we talked a little bit about TVs in the past, what about TVs of the future? Nowadays you can watch television on this very tiny screens, like the ipod video. What do you think about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right. I&#39;ve just seen one of them for the first time. I think they&#39;re fantastic. They&#39;re really great. Yeah, especially when traveling. But the future of TV, I was listening to an interviewer
  <span class="audionotes">
   a few nights ago
  </span>
  with Bill Gates and he&#39;s going to try and move from computers to TV - interactive TV - and this sounds good. Yeah, TV of the future. Sounds great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what was he saying about
  <span class="audionotes">
   interactive TV
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  He was talking about if it was a quiz show you could actually join in with the quiz and answer the questions, or if you were watching the Olympics then you could actually choose which events you wanted to watch, so sometimes if they are showing the olympics on TV they&#39;ll show running and then maybe they&#39;ll show swimming and maybe they&#39;ll show archery. If you didn&#39;t want to watch swimming you could choose your schedule and what to watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that would be cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and also for sports you could maybe choose your own sports team, which would be good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I actually saw another thing on TV in the future, and they we&#39;re saying because of what is happening now about buying television shows over the internet that soon there will be TV with no commercials. You just buy the program for one dollar and then you watch it without commercials
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that would be fun, yeah. That would be good. Hopefully, I want them to see them actually, I know they do a little bit, but I&#39;d like it so you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   hook up your PC
  </span>
  to your TV as well. I know you can a little bit, so download things on your PC and then watch on the TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So
  <span class="audionotes">
   when we&#39;re old and grey
  </span>
  we&#39;ll be able to tell our children &#34;In our day, we actually had to get up and turn the knob.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right, but it&#39;s not so long ago. Only what - 10 years, 15 years ago?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I know. It&#39;s crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Things are moving fast
