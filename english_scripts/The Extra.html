   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Matt, we&#39;re talking about acting and you were an extra. Can you talk a little about what an extra is and your experience?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Sure. Extra work is basically background in any scene for whatever reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obviously, movies and television, they need to be
  <span class="audionotes">
   authentic looking
  </span>
  so they obviously, in restaurants or in places of public business, they need extras to walk behind the main actors or be set behind the main actors to set the scene, so there is tons of work in Los Angeles and New York for those types of jobs and obviously they are paid a lot less but people do survive doing that and use it as a way to
  <span class="audionotes">
   springboard their career
  </span>
  and meet people and
  <span class="audionotes">
   network
  </span>
  and make contacts while they are on the set because extra work is mainly about waiting and you are on the set for long periods of time, from twelve to sixteen hours doing
  <span class="audionotes">
   virtually nothing
  </span>
  but waiting for the set to be ready for you to go out do your twenty second saying and then go off the set and wait until they reposition the cameras, so it&#39;s a very... it&#39;s quite boring and so you need to have something else to do while you are waiting and a lot of people in Los Angeles use that to meet people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, so how did you get started? How did you get onto a movie set?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  I was in San Diego living at the time and I had just quit my job in real estate and was taking acting classes in San Diego, and actually the guy who taught my classes also was a
  <span class="audionotes">
   pseudo-agent
  </span>
  or knew people who did a lot of film work in San Diego and so I was able to get work in San Diego for a couple of months and then from there found out about the extra work and was intrigued and obviously, naturally I was looking towards Los Angeles just because that is where you need to go to get work if want to do that for a career.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Thanks Matt.
