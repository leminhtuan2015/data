    Akane:
   </strong>
   Hey, Ruth, let&#39;s play a game?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, great idea.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   So, you think of one person in your head and I&#39;ll ask you questions and I&#39;ll try to guess who you&#39;re thinking of.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So does it need to be a famous person?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yes, make it a famous person.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   OK. OK, I&#39;ve got one.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   OK, is this person an athlete?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   No
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Is this person a movie star?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   No, not that either.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Is this person a politician?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   No.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Is this person a singer?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, OK.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Now, is this person a man or a woman?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   It&#39;s a woman.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, OK.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Is it a child or an adult?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   An adult.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, I see. So a woman, and an adult. Is this person from Asia?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   No, definitely not.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Is she from North America?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   No.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Hm. Is she from Africa?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Not Africa either.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Is she from Europe?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Nope.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, dear. Is she from Australia?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s right.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, Australia. OK. Let me think about this. Does she have brown hair?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Kind of brown, kind of blond.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Kind of brown. OK. Does she have big eyes?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes she does.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, big eyes, blond hair. Is she very beautiful?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Is she muscular?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   I think she&#39;s got a good body.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Has this person been famous for a very long time?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes, as far as I can remember, actually.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   For a very long time. And is she popular amongst older people?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Not very old people but popular among twenty and thirty year olds, I think.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Twenty and thirty year olds. OK. Alright. Is this person on TV a lot?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes, and she used to be on TV even more than she is now.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, I see. So does that mean she used to be an actress?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yes she did.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well, I think I know who she is.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Go on then. You have a guess.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Kylie Minogue.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Correct. You got it.
