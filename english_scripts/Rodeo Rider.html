   John
  </b>
  : So Sarah, I was wondering, what kind of sports do you like to play?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Well, I love riding horses. And actually, when I was in college, I took a lot of classes about horseback riding. So I can do all sorts of sports on horseback.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Wow! That&#39;s amazing. Don&#39;t you think riding horses is scary?
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : I think, it&#39;s part of the fun. For example, I used to be in the rodeo and I did a sport called saddle bronc riding. And the way you do this is they put the saddle on the horse and then they let the horse just
  <span class="audionotes">
   go crazy
  </span>
  . And the horse runs, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   bucks
  </span>
  , and tries to get you off, and you try to stay on. And it&#39;s really scary but it&#39;s also really exciting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Wow! That&#39;s what&#39;s called a bucking bronco, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. And it&#39;s really hard to stay on. In fact, you win if you can stay on 8 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Oh, that doesn&#39;t seem very long.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : It&#39;s really, really long. When I was – it&#39;s really long when you&#39;re on the horse. My first time, I only stayed on about 4 seconds and then I fell off in the middle of ring and I got
  <span class="audionotes">
   knocked out
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Whoa!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. And the rest – yeah, and I had a big
  <span class="audionotes">
   black eye
  </span>
  for about two months.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Wow! From falling off a horse. That&#39;s why it seems scary. Isn&#39;t it really dangerous?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : It is. It is really dangerous. And they don&#39;t make you wear helmet or any safety gear. I didn&#39;t wear a helmet my first time. I think it was pretty stupid.
 </p>
 <p>
  You start – so the horse starts in a metal cage. So the horse can&#39;t move. And then you sit on top of the horse, on the horse&#39;s back in the saddle. And then you say, I&#39;m ready and they open the door. And the horse explodes and just starts jumping, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   turning and twisting
  </span>
  . And the horse did about three or four jumps and I fell off.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Wow! How many seconds did you make it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Three.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Three?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Probably about 3 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : So you would have to do that more than twice as long to win.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. I got better at it, but I never could stay on for 8 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Did you try any other rodeo events?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. I tried to do
  <span class="audionotes">
   calf roping
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : What&#39;s that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : This is a sport where you have your horse and your horse is trained. It&#39;s not the wild horse from before. And there&#39;s a calf, and you try to throw your rope so that you catch the calf. And a calf is a baby cow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Wow! And so, what do you have to do if you get your rope around the cow?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Then you have to run up to the cow and you have to tie the cow&#39;s legs together. And when you finish tying the cow&#39;s legs together, the timer stops. So you want to do it as fast as you can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : That sounds really fun. And it doesn&#39;t sound as dangerous as the saddle bronc competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : No. It&#39;s not as dangerous. But after a while, I started to feel bad for the baby cow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : It&#39;s just he&#39;s a small little baby and he&#39;s really scared, and he&#39;s trying to run away. And I started to feel bad about catching him with the rope and tying him up. So I stopped doing it.
