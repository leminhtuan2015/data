  Vella:
 </strong>
 OK, Daniel, I know you&#39;re still really young but I know you must be thinking about what you&#39;re going to do in the future so my question would be what do you want to achieve in your life?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Well, there are definitely three things I want to do. For example, I want to do before I die, at least three things. The first one is I want to visit every continent in the earth. I&#39;m still young but I want to do it in the next couple of years. I&#39;ve never been to Africa, for example, that&#39;s a continent, that&#39;s a part of the world I&#39;m very interested in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second one is that I want to see things from a different
  <span class="audionotes">
   perspective
  </span>
  . For example, I want to climb a really, really high mountain. I don&#39;t know, Everest would be amazing but I know like you need the special training and stuff like that. Or do
  <span class="audionotes">
   paragliding
  </span>
  , I would love to have the feeling that I&#39;m flying. That&#39;s something that really, really calls my attention to see, you know, to see something from a different perspective. It can give you not only the experience but also it can help you think in a very different way for, I don&#39;t know, many things in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the third one is definitely to
  <span class="audionotes">
   raise my children
  </span>
  . I don&#39;t have any yet but, I don&#39;t know, I would love to have that feeling that I&#39;ve done my job and I&#39;ve finished it so, I don&#39;t know, to have my children, to raise them properly and to see that they succeed in what they do. Those are the three things I would love to do, I don&#39;t know, before I die.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  That is
  <span class="audionotes">
   sweet
  </span>
  . But earlier you told me like you were afraid of heights. Do you still want to do this thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I am a little bit but that&#39;s a thing that I mean at least once even though you are afraid you have to do it at least once. I&#39;m not going to do it every week, the paragliding thing, but at least once I wouldn&#39;t mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  And do you have anything specific that you want to do in Africa?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  No, it&#39;s just, there are so many, I think,
  <span class="audionotes">
   myths
  </span>
  about Africa. People tell you different stories. How they live, what they do, what the conditions are that I want to see it by myself. I know Africa it&#39;s really different because it&#39;s really big. It&#39;s really different among the countries but it has so many cultures that I really want to go and see it by myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Good. I hope you get the chance to do those three things before you die.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Thanks.
