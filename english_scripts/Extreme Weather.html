  Daniel
 </strong>
 : So how about the weather in Argentina?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Well the weather in Argentina depends on the part of Argentina that we are talking about.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Uh-uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : For instance, the north is very dry and extreme.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Like in summer, the temperature can go till forty, forty five and very dry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Right and you can have like minus zeros,
  <span class="audionotes">
   minus zero
  </span>
  temperatures in winter as well but very, very dry. In the east it&#39;s tropical, mainly summer most of the year, a lot of rain, everything is green.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : The center where Buenos Aires, the capital, is located is moderated but Patagonia which is the south of Argentina is very cold, dry and there is snow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Which means that in the same moment we can be, if you are in the north it will be very dry and hot or it could be snowing or it could be raining in a rainforest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Wow. Do you get, when you said extreme weather, do you get this thunderstorm, thunder lighting?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s not common, maybe it&#39;s like
  <span class="audionotes">
   once in a while
  </span>
  a thunderstorm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : But not more than this. We don&#39;t have El Nino and
  <span class="audionotes">
   monsoon
  </span>
  , this kind of things or rainy season. We don&#39;t have this kind of weather.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : What happens when you get
  <span class="audionotes">
   thunderstorms
  </span>
  ? What happens with the people? Do you like them? Do you get scared?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : I think that if you are a kid, you get a little scared because you are not used to but if you are an adult you are cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : I had a very bad experience that was like I experienced a
  <span class="audionotes">
   twister
  </span>
  when I was a kid.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : That was kind of unusual, very unusual in my country and so I get a little scared.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK. I hope it doesn&#39;t really happen any more.
