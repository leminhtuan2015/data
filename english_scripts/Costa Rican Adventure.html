   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Steven, you&#39;re from Costa Rica. Now, I look on the internet sometimes for really cool adventures, and Costa Rica&#39;s always
  <span class="audionotes">
   up there
  </span>
  for these wild things you can do, like Kayaking, surfing, windsurfing, nature hikes, volcano hikes and stuff. Have you done any of these things in your country?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  If you haven&#39;t done all these activities in Costa Rica, you pretty much are not in Costa Rica. And Costa Rica is mostly composed of these activities. You can surf in both seas, because we have both seas. We also kayak. Kayak you can go through the forest in Costa Rica. You can go inside, look at the roots of Costa Rica and also rock climbing. Rock climbing ... we got tons of mountains, everywhere. You can see them everywhere and if you see a mountain, you can climb it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So of all these activities, sounds like you&#39;ve done them all, which is your favorite?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  My favorite I think is kayaking because you just goto the inside of the forest. You go inside. You can see animals moving around. You can see the sea where fishes are just swimming through you. And of course if you are a
  <span class="audionotes">
   nature lover
  </span>
  as me, I would recommend kayaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So when you do this, do you actually have to own your own equipment like your own kayak and your own helmet or is it something you just rent?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, for these places they are all available. You can rent them, but if you own one, you can take it with a kayak wherever you want, but it&#39;s more
  <span class="audionotes">
   efficient
  </span>
  and it&#39;s better for the person to just rent the kayak as they maintain it and you don&#39;t have to have lying down in your garage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you need training before you do this or do they just
  <span class="audionotes">
   plop you right inside
  </span>
  a kayak and push you downstream?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Actually kayaking in Costa Rica is not like throwing you down the river. The water is chill, and you don&#39;t need any training. You just go
  <span class="audionotes">
   hop into
  </span>
  the kayak and and start moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sounds good man. I want to go.
