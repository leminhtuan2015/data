   Todd:
  </strong>
  Rob, when you first came to Japan you said you did construction.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rob:
  </strong>
  Yes, I was hired as a framer for 2x4 types of homes, so the same style of homes that are built in Canada or America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so what do you mean by frames?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rob:
  </strong>
  Framing, the actually frame of the house so, we start from the
  <span class="audiodef">
   foundation
  </span>
  , we lay down the sub-floor, we build the walls, a second floor, more walls,
  <span class="audiodef">
   square everything up
  </span>
  , and then add in the windows, the exterior wrap, and on some occasions we will finish the roof.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How long does it take you to make a house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rob:
  </strong>
  Our job would take around two to three weeks, with three guys, a team of three, we able to frame a house,
  <span class="audiodef">
   shingle
  </span>
  the roof,
  <span class="audiodef">
   install
  </span>
  the windows and the doors in less than three weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. Now when you work, do you work with a Canadian crew or Japanese?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rob:
  </strong>
  Actually, it was quite
  <span class="audiodef">
   mixed
  </span>
  . Our boss was from Seattle, Washington, and we had people from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and some Japanese workers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s cool. What it a good experience?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rob:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was a very good experience. I hope one day maybe to be able to build my own house with some friends. It&#39;s possible to save money and it&#39;s the enjoyment of building something for yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, where would you build this house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rob:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a good question. I&#39;m thinking, maybe back in Canada, but maybe not in the East Coast. It&#39;d be possibly in B.C. or maybe in another country. Who knows?
