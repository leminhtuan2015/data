  Well, now I&#39;m in Japan
  <span class="audiodef">
   at the moment
  </span>
  , I&#39;m eating a lot of sushi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve only got
  <span class="audiodef">
   two weeks left
  </span>
  here so it&#39;s kind of suchi three times a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow! You really love the stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s fun.
  <span class="audiodef">
   It&#39;s great
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Where do you eat sushi?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Well, we either buy it in a supermarket, kind of buy a tray, about a thousand yen, or we&#39;ll go down to the conveyor belt restaurant just down the side the university on our way home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  <span class="audiodef">
   Pick up
  </span>
  a few plates.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The conveyor belt restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know the Japanese word for that. We
  <span class="audiodef">
   call
  </span>
  it the conveyor belt restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  When you go to sushi, how much does it cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s 130 yen for one plate, and usually there is two of us that go and usually we spend about one and a half thousand yen (1,500), about ten plates.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ten plates!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Yeah! We like it!

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Jessica, what are you going to have for dinner tonight?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Tonight is sushi night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, you&#39;re going to sushi.

   </a>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Well, actually no. My girlfriend and I, we buy sushi every Tuesdays and Fridays, and those are sushi night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, Wow
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Yeah. It&#39;s because, well we buy it in the supermarket and bring it home cause it&#39;s cheaper than eating in a restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is a lot cheaper.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yeah
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what sushi do you eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Well, we always buy the box, which has a little bit of everything. And I&#39;m never quite sure what any of it is. I know there&#39;s a piece of salmon in there. Some octopus, or squid. Um, and then from that point on I&#39;m not quite sure what anything else is, but it&#39;s all delicious, so I eat it all, and then we also have rolls, so we buy just different rolls. Actually, last week we tried natto. Have you ever tried that before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s gross.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s the most vile, disgusting food you can ever possibly eat, so I definitely don&#39;t recommend that but.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, have you had uni?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I have not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uni is gross. Uni is sea urchin and it looks like an orange tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Oh, I&#39;ve seen that. Is that what that is?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, stay away from that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I will. I definitely will.
