   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hello, Jessica.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Hi, Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Jessica, when were you born?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I was born October 6th, 1981.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Wow, 1981
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man, you&#39;re young. Whoo! I&#39;m an old guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m 22 so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! My birthday is October 2nd, 1969, so we have over 10 years between us.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so we&#39;re both libras.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica: Right.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, I don&#39;t even know, what is libra? People say, oh, you&#39;re a libra? What does that mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Well, Libra I think is just balance. Right, so we don&#39;t, we&#39;re not extreme, neither one way nor another, so we keep that kind of happy medium all the time and we don&#39;t ever freak out and we&#39;re just kind of mellow. Just very equal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So were very mellow, very equal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I think so. Kind of a nice equilibrium.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well you&#39;ve worked with me awhile. Am I mellow?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. Yeah, I think so I think so
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maybe not, maybe not
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I think so, yeah, no, definitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maybe I go against the sign.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Right
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, how about you? Are you mellow?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I think so. When it comes, cause I don&#39;t tend to go one extreme or the other. Just kind of straight off.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Even keel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica: That&#39;s right.
  </strong>
