 : So since we&#39;re talking about home schooling, what are some of the pros and cons that you feel of home schooling?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shiloh
  </strong>
  : Well one of the good things about home schooling is definitely that you are able to work off of your own schedule. I didn&#39;t have to wake up early every morning. If I did, I could get my work done early. The amount of work that I had, the time I spent doing it was dependent upon me and my schedule and how much time I wanted to work. I had almost the same amount of work as all of my other friends in real schools but the difference was I didn&#39;t have scheduled breaks or lunches or anything so if I sat down for four hours and I just wanted to work straight, then I could finish a whole day&#39;s worth of work in four hours. That&#39;s a good thing about it, I was able to travel and some days I wouldn&#39;t even do any school work because I&#39;d be busy doing other things but that meant that I would have to do two days some other time. One of the bad things was that I didn&#39;t get to meet quite as many new people. I didn&#39;t have the typical high school experience which I feel shapes a lot of who people are. I wasn&#39;t able to meet friends in that sense, in the high school sense. I still have great friends and I&#39;m not a loner
  <span class="audionotes">
   by any means
  </span>
  but it was difficult to meet friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adria
  </strong>
  : So did you find yourself
  <span class="audionotes">
   slacking off
  </span>
  ? Some days you didn&#39;t do any school work because you were too busy but did you find yourself taking many breaks or not wanting to do school work sometimes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shiloh
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that&#39;s a big problem I think with home schooling. The student really has to be
  <span class="audionotes">
   self-motivated
  </span>
  and if the student is not self-motivated, then the parent who is doing the home schooling has to be very strict because it&#39;s really easy to just not do your work or to fake it and kind of do it badly and it&#39;s really important that somebody is there to drive you to do it well and to finish everything. Fortunately I&#39;m a fairly motivated guy and I always wanted to get my work done because I always had better things to be doing and I knew that if I didn&#39;t do it today, I&#39;d have to do it twice tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adria
  </strong>
  : So do you think that&#39;s something home schooling taught you was self-motivation that maybe other kids lack?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shiloh
  </strong>
  : I think so. It taught me self-motivation and also it taught me how to plan things out. I was able to
  <span class="audionotes">
   plan out
  </span>
  my day and my schedule. I would think to myself well tomorrow I want to do this thing, I want to go do this which means I have to do this today in order to do this tomorrow.
