  </strong>
  Hello.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Tini, can you please mention all the countries you&#39;ve been in in the world where you were a student?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, until now I&#39;ve studied in Hong Kong for around six years, and America for a year and in Japan for more than three years, actually.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s incredible. Did you also study in Vietnam, your country?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Oh, of course. Yes, since I&#39;m Vietnamese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and you were in high school in America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes. My senior year in high school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, great. And you&#39;re a university student now in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes, sir.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and you also studied in high school in Vietnam?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes, sir.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. And what about in Hong Kong? What grades were you a student?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  I studied from grade two to grade six.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Now that makes you kind of an expert on young people around the world and what they like to do for fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   to some extent
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So what do friends like to do for fun in high school in America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, of course, you know teenagers, we all like to have parties, and one very interesting thing about parties in America is like they like to do it at their own house, especially when their parents are out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yes. Actually, I&#39;m American. I remember well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh. Well, like, like when your parents are out on a business trip or on a vacation to some other states or to some other countries and then, you know, you will be
  <span class="audionotes">
   baby-sitting your house
  </span>
  for a couple of days, and that is actually a really opportunity to have some parties.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right. Actually, I remember there&#39;s a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   peer pressure
  </span>
  actually, so if your parents are away you feel like you have to have a party.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Exactly. Exactly. Like, &#34;Hey, I heard that your parents are away. Why not this, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. So does that happen in other countries, like in Vietnam or in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Oh, absolutely no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so. Like to my own experience, I don&#39;t think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, first of all, parents are always home. That is the number one rule, and you actually, you can&#39;t, you know stay, we have like
  <span class="audionotes">
   curfew
  </span>
  times for... especially for students in Vietnam, for example you have to be back home at ten thirty. And
  <span class="audionotes">
   period
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty early.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, yes, you know people are pretty conservative.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But kids don&#39;t have curfews in America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  I... Yes, I do think so, but you know, um.. they are pretty more flexible.
