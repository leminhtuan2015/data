   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey Victor, I hear you&#39;re going home tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  Yes, I am
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   too bad
  </span>
  . So how long have you been here?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve been here for two weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sorry, I was never sure. Why did you come to Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  Came to Japan to study martial arts.
  <em>
   Budo Ju Jitsu
  </em>
  is the art that we study.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh! OK, cool. So are like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   black belt
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  Yes, yes!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really? Wow, how long have you been doing your martial arts?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve been studying this art for about 18 years I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  A long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a long time. You&#39;re a young looking guy. You like 18 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m an old guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, so when you go back to the States you also train
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  Yes, yes! We have a group that we train in martial arts there as sort of a hobby. In a way, it&#39;s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   sort of a way of life
  </span>
  also. But I have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   real job
  </span>
  . I&#39;m a civil engineer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, actually what does a civil engineer do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  In America, a civil engineer designs things.
  <span class="audionotes">
   In my case
  </span>
  , I
  <span class="audionotes">
   work on
  </span>
  buildings, buildings that have structural problems and I work on repair plans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Sounds like a tough job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s OK. It&#39;s interesting. All buildings need repairs and it&#39;s fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Great. Thanks a lot, Victor. Have a safe trip tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Victor:
  </strong>
  Well, thank you very much.
