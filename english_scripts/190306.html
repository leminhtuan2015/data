U.S. President Donald Trump criticized opposition Democrats Tuesday for opening a wide range investigation of him and his administration.
<br><br>
"It's a disgrace, it's a disgrace for our country.  I'm not surprised that it's happening.  Basically, they've started the campaign."
<br><br>
The president also tweeted it was "presidential harassment."
<br><br>
On Monday, House of Representatives Democrats demanded documents from 81 people and entities linked to Trump's 2016 campaign, his businesses and more.  The House panel said it is investigating obstruction of justice, possible public corruption and abuses of power during Trump's two-year presidency.
<br><br>
The president has long denied wrongdoing involving his campaign's links to Russia and during his presidency.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Trump says he will visit with survivors of violent tornadoes that killed 23 people in the southern state of Alabama on Friday.
<br><br>
Trump made the announcement at the White House Tuesday as rescue workers continued to sift through the rubble left by the Sunday storms in search of victims.
<br><br>
"It's been a tragic situation, but a lot of good work is being done.  I'm in constant touch with the governor and also the governor of Georgia.  And so we'll be going to the area."
<br><br>
The victims range in age from 6 to 93.

Later, a similar package was identified in the post room of London's busiest rail station Waterloo.
<br><br>
And a third was found in an office at London City Airport in East London.

Venezuelan President Nichol&aacute;s Maduro said on Tuesday he would defeat a "crazed minority" determined to destabilize the country.
<br><br>
These were Maduro's first public comments since opposition leader Juan Guaid&oacute; defied him by returning on Monday.
<br><br>
During a ceremony to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the death of his predecessor Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, Maduro called on supporters to attend "anti-imperialist" demonstrations on March 9, coinciding with an opposition march announced by Guaid&oacute;.

A Japanese court Tuesday approved the release of former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn from prison.  But his release was delayed when prosecutors filed a last-minute appeal to the court's decision.
<br><br>
The AP's Charles De Ledesma reports.
<br><br>
Bail for Ghosn was set at $8.9 million.  But the end of his four months of detention in Japan has had to be put back after prosecutors appealed the decision.
<br><br>
A lawyer for Ghosn said he would not be able to leave the Tokyo Detention Center until Wednesday at the earliest even if the appeal is rejected because bail procedures can't be done at night.
<br><br>
The acceptance of Ghosn's request for bail, his third, comes after his lawyer said he was confident the auto executive's bid would succeed.

Officials with the Syrian Democratic Forces, Kurdish militias and human rights monitors confirmed the exodus late Monday though the number of fighters and civilians vary.
