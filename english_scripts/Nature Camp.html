   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Steven you&#39;ve been talking a lot about adventures you can do in your country. Do you have any stories of adventure that&#39;s happened to you in your own country of Costa Rica?

   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, when I was in middle school, my school decided to take all the students in my grade to go to this place called Punta Mona where it&#39;s just
  <span class="audionotes">
   the tip of
  </span>
  Costa Rica. It&#39;s located northeast of Costa Rica. This place is â€¦ that I went is just mainly in the forest. I was living there for one week without electricity , without any technology, and we were using
  <span class="audionotes">
   biodegradable
  </span>
  products, for example, cactus, washing face products which you don&#39;t really find in the markets, and also we were eating nothing out of meat. We were only eating leaves. We were eating plants. We were eating vegetables that was in the ground, just walking through and we just found them. This is really wonderful. We were also kayaking which is wonderful for me. Canoping. We were growing some plants for later. And of course we were living with the bugs. It was horrible that we were getting bitten all the time, but we found, like for example, some herbal which we just
  <span class="audionotes">
   applied
  </span>
  and the insects would just disappear from
  <span class="audionotes">
   thin air
  </span>
  . You would never see them again if you use this herbal, and this just educates people how the environment is so important. You don&#39;t need drugs from the
  <span class="audionotes">
   pharmaceuticals
  </span>
  to just survive. You can use plants. You can use the trees and all these leaves which you can use.
