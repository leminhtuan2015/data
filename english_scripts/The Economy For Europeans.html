 : So Maria, you&#39;ve seen a lot of the stuff that&#39;s been happening recently in Europe and you know that things have not exactly gone very well. What do you think are the, what&#39;s the
 <span class="audionotes">
  outlook
 </span>
 for Denmark in the future? Do you think you guys will do well or...?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll do that well because I&#39;m from a generation where we, like my
  <span class="audionotes">
   generation
  </span>
  , we had it very well. We had a very good, we could choose whatever job we wanted, we could still choose whatever education we wanted if we&#39;re smart enough at least. We get paid from the Government to study. I get a lot of money every month. I still do even though I am on exchange just to study so compared to other countries where it is a
  <span class="audionotes">
   privilege
  </span>
  to study, we just, if we feel like it we&#39;ll study and we might wait a little but now they&#39;re saying that we&#39;re this luxury generation, that we&#39;re not used to working hard and I can recognize that because I&#39;m not used to working for anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  So when we begin to
  <span class="audionotes">
   struggle
  </span>
  finding jobs because we have like a high rate of unemployment, especially for young people, people who graduate usually they wait. If you don&#39;t have a very specific education, doctors I think are OK, people like that, but if you have a humanistic education, you might have to wait more than a year to find a job. My sister&#39;s graduating now and she is like
  <span class="audionotes">
   dying
  </span>
  because she has a fear for that. When she graduates with her social European studies, she will have a very hard time finding anything. So I think the biggest problem is the personality of the Danish youth because we are not used to having to do anything and now we have to because the environment has changed in Europe.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don&#39;t know economically because we still have a lot of like huge
  <span class="audionotes">
   enterprises
  </span>
  and we have a lot of, the way we&#39;re placed we have pretty good connections with America and we&#39;re in Europe. We have like the whole of Europe around us and of course we, as a part of Scandinavia, we have good connections with like we have some more than just connections with Sweden and Norway, we are like, I don&#39;t know, closer than we would have been for example Germany which actually Denmark is situated on Germany so we have the link to Germany but we&#39;re still closer to Sweden. So we will probably manage but we will have to change economically and this might be a problem that we&#39;re getting a socialist government at the moment. I think it&#39;s great because I love it that we have it this way but we might get in economic trouble, difficulties, so I am probably going to have a harder time than my parents. It&#39;s got to work, it&#39;s going to help that I&#39;m studying business though because I can always just work in another country, Australia for example, but yeah I don&#39;t know, the future is vague.
