   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you&#39;re in law school, Travis.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Travis:
  </strong>
  Yes, I&#39;m in law school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Normally, how do you get a job after you finish law school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Travis:
  </strong>
  Well, the law school that I&#39;m at is considered to be a top-tier law school, and so my law school has a lot o power to get companies to actually come to my law school, and interview with students at the school, and the way my law school does it is every year, in the summer, the last week of summer before school starts, they get about 700 firms to come for about one week and interview students on campus and it&#39;s called early interview week so during this early interview week, basically the school rents out an entire hotel and every firm will be there for about one day, so, it&#39;s like every day you have about 150, 200 firms on any particular day. Each with their own room in the hotel, and so the students will wait in a common area and when it&#39;s their time to interview they&#39;ll go to a hotel room and knock on the door and go inside and interview with that firm and they&#39;ll get maybe 20 or 30 minutes with that firm, and then afterwards if the firm likes them the firm might actually invite them to go to lunch or to go to a dinner that night and they&#39;ll be selected so maybe every day, a firm will interview as many as 50 candidates, but only invite maybe 5 or 6 of them to go out to dinner with them that night, so this lasts about 4 or 5 days, and at the end of that, other than being really tired, hopefully you&#39;ve gotten a couple of job offers, well not job offers, but basically an offer to come back to a second interview, which will hopefully, eventually lead to a job offer. So, for the students it&#39;s quite difficult. Over the course of a week some students will interview with as many as 25 firms, over a four or five day period, so they can be interviewing anywhere from five to as many as ten firms in a single day. So if you&#39;re interviewing 10 firms in a singe day, each 30 minutes long, you&#39;re going to be there a long time. At least 5 or 6 hours of straight interviewing, going from one room to the next room to the next room, to the next room to interview with a firm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So it&#39;s pretty exhausting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Travis:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s really exhausting and I&#39;m not looking forward to it at all.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Kawabe, can you talk about your first job interview?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Sure, first job interview! This is a funny story and that was a time I took the interview, had an interview with the TV broadcaster, and then it was a very famous one in Yotsuya, in Tokyo and that was a very important interview because the job is interesting and there are many, there are so many applicants to the same position so, and the thing is I was late for the that interview  and I was late for thirty minutes. I was really bad, you know, and then the reason is, at that time I was working for, I was a bike rider at a delivery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, you delivered stuff?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Bike delivery!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really, what did you deliver?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Ah, the documents and you know whatever it is when you want to send somewhere the thing fast!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, cool job!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s what I was doing, and then before the interview I was delivering one thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, no, yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  And then, so, anyway, I was late and in my bag, when I was driving the motorcycle I put my suits and shoes and everything, I&#39;ve got to wear for the interview and I was in a rush, and I&#39;d been to that building where I had an interview and in front of that building there was a MacDonald and then I rushed into the toilet of that MacDonald that was on the first floor and I think, you know, it was funny if you were looking at me. I was wearing..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I can imagine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  I was wearing like a driver&#39;s suit and when I came out from the toilet I was in a suit, like Superman! And then, yeah, I changed my clothes, very very quickly in the toilet and I rushed into the building for the interview but I was 30 minutes late, and actually I got a great interview with the guys of the broadcast station, but ah, since I was late that was the only and biggest reason I couldn&#39;t get that job. Actually, they said that if you were not late I could take you, so it&#39;s a funny story, now but at that time I was like so disapointed with myself, (Yeah) I was so stupid. The job was great!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve done that too! I think we all do that at one point. Well!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I learned a lot of things from that experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But you got another job with another TV company after that, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Mm, it&#39;s not a TV company but the same kind of job and it was lucky cause, since I missed the first one I got the second one and that is why I could join to the World Cup.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It all worked out at the end!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yeah! Fortunately
 </p>
