   Silvia:
  </strong>
  So talking about Mexican celebrations, is Independence Day and Cinco De Mayo the same thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  No, no, no. They&#39;re very different. Actually, Independence Day is celebrated the 15th and 16th of September and Cinco De Mayo is celebrated the fifth of May.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  And why do people always
  <span class="audionotes">
   confuse Cinco De Mayo with Independence Day?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  That is a very good question and I don&#39;t really have an answer for it, but a lot of my friends who are from different countries, especially Europe and the United States. Every time it&#39;s like the 5th of May, they want to celebrate with me
  <span class="audionotes">
   as if
  </span>
  it were a very, very Mexican holiday, and it&#39;s a bit surprising because we don&#39;t think it&#39;s that important in Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  So why do you think it got so famous?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. Maybe it has a
  <span class="audionotes">
   catchy name
  </span>
  or something, but the holiday of Cinco de Mayo is basically when the Mexican Army won against the French Army, and it was a very
  <span class="audionotes">
   unlikely
  </span>
  battle, and it all started because of a French bakery getting burned and we called it like the battle of the cakes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a funny name.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s a funny name. It&#39;s a bit ironic because it all started out of this little bakery getting burned and then the French
  <span class="audionotes">
   declared war
  </span>
  with Mexico and then we won so I guess that&#39;s why.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  What do they do for that day? In the States I think they celebrate it right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I think they celebrate it and as you know there&#39;s a large community of like Mexican Americans, so they do celebrate and they probably get together, eat and maybe drink a little.
