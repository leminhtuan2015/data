   Katie
  </strong>
  : Hey Todd, can I ask you a favor?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Sure, anytime.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Um, I really need a place to stay, and I heard that your place is on AirBNB.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It is on AirBNB. I do rent my house, but for you it&#39;s free.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : OH, amazing. Can I stay there then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You can. How long?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Maybe a week or two weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK, when?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : From next Monday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, actually, you can do that.
  <span class="audionotes">
   That works.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Excellent. Thank you so much! How about a car? Can I park my car?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ah, that&#39;s a problem. You can&#39;t park your car because there&#39;s no space, but there&#39;s a cheap parking lot about maybe two blocks away.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So, it&#39;s only
  <span class="audionotes">
   a couple
  </span>
  dollars a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : OK, I guess I can park my car there. How about cooking there? Can I cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Of course, you can cook. I have a stove, a frigerator. You can bring your own food. You can do
  <span class="audionotes">
   whatever you want
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Excellent. Thank you. Can I use the Internet?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You can use the Internet. There&#39;s a password. I will write down the password before I leave, and I will write down the password before you get there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Excellent. Thank you so much! I was thinking about asking my friend if he can stay. Can my friend stay over?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, sure, so your friend can stay. Not a problem I don&#39;t think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : He has a dog? Can he bring his dog?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that is a problem. Does the dog have a cage?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Ah, no, but we can get a cage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m not sure about the dog. If the dog is in a cage, it&#39;s OK in the house but I think you can&#39;t have the dog in the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : OK, how about smoking? My friend is a very
  <span class="audionotes">
   heavy smoker
  </span>
  . Can he smoke outside?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, he can smoke outside, just please pick up cigarette butts, but of course, he can&#39;t smoke inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : OK, he can&#39;t smoke inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : OK, how about if we want to have a party? Can we have a party?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, you can have a party. That&#39;s OK, but please be quiet. Don&#39;t be too loud. The neighbors live very close to my house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Alright, that sounds good. Thanks. And I have one more question. Can I use the washing machine?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, of course. You can use anything. You use the washing machine. You can use the Internet. You can use the TV. You can use
  <span class="audionotes">
   anything you like
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Wow, excellent. That sounds great. Thank you so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I will write down directions for my house, and I will send you a map, and you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   check it out
  </span>
  and get all the information, and just I will leave the key for you with my neighbor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Excellent. Thank you very much!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Sure, no problem.
