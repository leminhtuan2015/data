   </strong>
   Now Steven, I&#39;m single and, but you are married and you are a father, correct?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   That is correct, yeah.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK. I&#39;m just curious. What is it like being a father?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Ah, right. OK, well, I think if I first of all talk about what it was like not being a father, being me and not being a father. I think I used to make the most of my free time, well in fact I didn&#39;t make the most of my free time. I was a very lazy person. I was an incredible time waster, so I would have all of this free time to make use of and I would probably just sit in front of the TV, or I&#39;d probably go to a pub and drink, but anyway I took my time for granted. I thought I have this time. It wasn&#39;t such a precious thing for me. I had so much of it.
   <br>
   Once I became a father, suddenly my time disappeared but strangely enough, now that I&#39;ve become a father and I&#39;ve, it&#39;s taught me to appreciate the time I have. My time is now very limited. My work has become busier but I actually make much more use of my time now than when I did so much of it. It&#39;s kind of strange.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   And how many children do you have?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>

   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Ah, two. BOys,
  </font>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, two boys.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Yep, they&#39;re both still very young. They keep us very busy. The eldest is four and the youngest is three.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Wow!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   So they need, they still need quite a lot of attention.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, so when you first have kids do you lose a lot of sleep? I&#39;m always worried that I won&#39;t be able to sleep.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Well, something that carried over from my previous lifestyle was an ability to sleep very well, and, um, fortunately I have a very understanding wife so if the children woke up, yeah, well because I had to work my wife was, my wife tended to be responsible. She would look after the children if they woke up during the evening, during the night, sorry, and I&#39;m such a good sleeper that even if they were crying incredibly loudly I could just go back to sleep. I don&#39;t think there are many fathers like me. I&#39;ve spoken to some other fathers and they don&#39;t have the same talent as I do.
