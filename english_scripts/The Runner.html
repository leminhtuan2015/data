   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Tim, we&#39;re going to talk about running.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, we&#39;ve been running the last
  <span class="audionotes">
   couple of
  </span>
  nights.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And,  you&#39;re much faster than me.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  You&#39;re a fast runner. How often do you run?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, now I only run about four days a week but when I was younger everyday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really? Wow! Did you run in high school or college?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I ran.. I started when I was six years old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   No kidding
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  And I started running and I ran
  <span class="audionotes">
   all the way through
  </span>
  the university.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So what
  <span class="audionotes">
   events
  </span>
  did you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Middle distance. Middle distance which is 1,500 meters to 5,000 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! Are you a better short distance runner or long distance runner?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Middle distance runner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Middle distance. OK, how far is a middle distance?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Oh.. 1,500 meters, about.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  1,500.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK! What&#39;s your fastest time in the 1,500 meters?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Ah, 3.... about 3:47.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Three minutes and forty seven seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I did that in high school actually. I wasn&#39;t so fast in the university.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh wow, man you can fly!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now I don&#39;t feel so bad when you run so much faster than me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve been
  <span class="audionotes">
   slowing down
  </span>
  . I&#39;ve been drinking beer so I don&#39;t run so fast anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we&#39;re getting older. Actually,  I&#39;m 33. How old are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m 27.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  27. Oh, OK. So, do you think you&#39;ll be running your whole life?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I think so, yeah. I grew up running in the woods, everyday in the woods and so I really want to get back to running in the woods everyday. I think it is really healthy thing to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. That&#39;s nice. OK. Thanks a lot, Tim.
