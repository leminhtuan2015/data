   Todd:
  </strong>
  Adrienne, we&#39;re going to talk about cleaning! So, first of all, how often do you clean, like your apartment?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Thoroughly, I would say I clean once a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, do you consider yourself a clean person?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I consider myself an organized person.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So, in your house what is the one room you hate cleaning?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Probably the bathroom, which includes the shower, the sink, toilet. (Yeah) All together.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so, why?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I just think it&#39;s the grossest part of the house. It always seems to accumulate the most dirt and grime (Yeah) pretty disgusting.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s hard to get the stuff off the tiles. (Right) You got to scrub and scrub and it&#39;s still brown or green or whatever color it is.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Exactly. It&#39;s just a difficult place to get into to clean, and there&#39;s lots of small spaces to get into and.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah! In Japan it&#39;s weird because they have these little portable bathrooms, you know, they&#39;re all plastic so,
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s easy. You just take the sprayer and spray the whole room.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah! I&#39;m convinced that they drop those bathrooms in a, with a helicopter. They just drop them right in there. You got everything, you know.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Easy! Convenient! Efficient!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What about laundry?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t like really doing any type of manual labor, but I don&#39;t mind doing laundry from time to time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I like laundry actually. I like the smell of the clothes when you finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s a good part of it, but I don&#39;t like to actually to do the work, washing!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually, I like to clean. That&#39;s why I have this question. (Mm) I&#39;m a clean freak. Like, I like washing dishes. I like doing laundry. Yeah!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s not fun for me. (No!) I&#39;d rather sleep given the choice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like you can pay me and I&#39;ll clean your apartment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, sounds good. Perfect!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How much? How much would you pay me?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Um, see, going rate for a maid these day, Todd?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maid! That&#39;s a sexist comment!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  It is a sexist comment! But it is, the going rate for a maid,
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Male cleaning attendant!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what they&#39;re called. They&#39;d still call them a maid service. Um, I don&#39;t know.I think it&#39;s about 15 dollars an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ooh! You&#39;d pay me 15 dollars an hour?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  No, that&#39;s the going rate. That&#39;s not what I&#39;ll pay you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I thought I was going to make some money!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Well, I thought I was going to get a discount.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  This web site&#39;s expensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, right, right, right!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So I need the money.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh! OK, 15 it is!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, but how dirty is your place?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Pretty, pretty dirty!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, well, I&#39;ll take a look at it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  You&#39;ll me working for the money, for sure!
  <br>
