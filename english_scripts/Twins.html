  OK, my twin brother. Well, my twin brother is called Daniel, and he is four minutes younger than me. We were both born on the 5th of January, and I think that we kind of look a like except that he&#39;s a lot taller than me and he has very dark hair but we have the same eyes and nose and smile, at least that&#39;s what people say. Um, I wouldn&#39;t say we are especially close, mm, not really, maybe when we were younger but we weren&#39;t always in the same classes at school because my parents wanted us to be a bit more different. Um, we used to be dressed when we were babies the same, me in pink and him in blue, and we used to have a birthday cake that was always, half was pink and half was blue, and mine had ballet slippers on it and his a football or a rugby ball, but I guess we are quite different personalities. He&#39;s really, really outgoing, and just very different from me. At school I was always in the top classes getting A&#39;s and he was always failing in the bottom classes, but he was really sporty and I wasn&#39;t so people said we were very different.
