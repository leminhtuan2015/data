   Annili, have you always been an English teacher?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Annili:
   </strong>
   No. Actually, I started out as a French teacher. That was my first job.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    JJ:
   </strong>
   Wow! So tell me about your first job.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>

   <strong>
    Annili:
   </strong>
   My first job. I was working in Central West Queensland in Australia so it was a
   <span class="audionotes">
    remote
   </span>
   <span class="audiodef">
    place
   </span>
   .
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    JJ:
   </strong>
   Sure.
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    Annili:
   </strong>
   For example, the nearest supermarket was about 100 kilometers away from me.
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    JJ:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s amazing.
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    Annili:
   </strong>
   So of course, the students lived-- some of the students lived
   <span class="audionotes">
    a long way away
   </span>
   from the schools. They had their lessons by
   <span class="audiodef">
    teleconference
   </span>
   , actually, school of the air.
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    JJ:
   </strong>
   Wow. So when you had a
   <span class="audionotes">
    teleconference
   </span>
   for example, how many students would be
   <span class="audionotes">
    on the air
   </span>
   at the same time?
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    Annili:
   </strong>
   I guess around eight, in two different locations.  I would be in the third location
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    JJ:
   </strong>
   Wow, that&#39;s amazing!
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    Annili:
   </strong>
   Yeah.
   <br>
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    JJ:
   </strong>
   Yeah! And how often would you be teaching like this?
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    Annili:
   </strong>
   Well, the students were
   <span class="audionotes">
    aged
   </span>
   between 9 and 12 years old. They had two French lessons a week by teleconference.
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    JJ:
   </strong>
   Wow, and how long was each lesson?
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    Annili:
   </strong>
   45 minutes
   <br>
   <strong>
    <br>
    JJ:
   </strong>
   Great. That&#39;s really interesting.
