   Todd:
  </strong>
  Phil, you said you&#39;re a teacher. Did you study education in college?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  No, actually, I studied engineering in college.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really. Engineer!
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I was an automotive when I was younger.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Automotive, like cars?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  <br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool. Wow.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  It was really interesting a job really exciting but I kind of
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    came into
   </span>
  </span>
  teaching to try something different and to maybe
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    gain confindence
   </span>
  </span>
  in myself as well.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So if you&#39;re an engineer then you must like gadgets, right?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, I love gadgets. I got many in my room.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what kind of gadgets to you have?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Well, my favorite has to be my laptop computer of course. I think everyone should have a laptop now because it&#39;s complete entertainment. I can watch movies. I can download music from the internet. I can write reports on my students. I can research new games on the internet. I can do anything in the world on my laptop. It&#39;s just amazing what you can do.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you talk about downloading things. Like you must have an MP3 player or ipod.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve got an ipod as well, yeah. I love my ipod. Everyday I listen to music. Music is one of my
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    main passions
   </span>
  </span>
  in life and I particularly like rock music and scar punk as well, so I download bands from all over the world on the internet that maybe ten years ago nobody would have been able to find information about, so I think things like ipod have opened up the world of music to everyone.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right No, I agree. Actually, I have an MP3 player and an ipod and I use them all the time.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s amazing.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you&#39;re really into your laptop. You&#39;re really into your ipod. Any other gadgets that you really like?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I suppose I have to say my digital camera. When I was younger, I was
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    absolutely useless
   </span>
  </span>
  at taking photographs - well I still am absolutely useless at taking photographs. I always manage to miss the main part of the picture or the thing I&#39;m aiming for. Once I get the lighting composition completely wrong. So with a digital camera, I can choose the photos I want and I can keep retaking them until I know I got the one I actually want, and then on my computer, back to my laptop again, I can edit the photos until they look exactly like I want them to, so digital camera is amazing for me.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I agree, like I use cameras a lot for the website and I couldn&#39;t make it without them.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s amazing how in the last ten years things have changed so much, like we said with the ipod earlier, I used to have a cassette player when I was younger.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil
  </strong>
  : It was huge, and it was like taking a brick with me everywhere I went, and not the ipod just fits in my pocket and I don&#39;t even know it&#39;s there. It&#39;s amazing the difference.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I listen to the podcasts on the way to work and it makes my train commute so much more enjoyable.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, I get the news from the BBC, the British website, so I can listen to the news in the morning and find out what&#39;s happened back in my home city. It&#39;s like
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    keeping in touch
   </span>
  </span>
  with the rest of the world
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right, right. OK, thanks a lot Phil.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  OK, thank you.
