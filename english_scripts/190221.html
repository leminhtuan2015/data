U.S.-backed forces are one step closer to liberating the last patch of Syrian territory held by the Islamic State terror group, but a final assault could still be days away.
<br><br>
On Wednesday, the global coalition tweeted "The most hardened of ISIS fighters still remain," but U.S.-backed forces "continue to receive civilians attempting to escape to safety."
<br><br>
The coalition statement came hours after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces broke a stalemate with IS fighters still holed up in the village of Baghuz, securing the release of hundreds of civilians, including women and children.

The al-Shabab militant group claimed responsibility for the assassination of Somalia's deputy attorney general on Wednesday in Mogadishu.
<br><br>
Authorities say the attack happened in the Hodan district as Mohamed Abdirahman Mursal left home for work.
<br><br>
Witnesses told VOA Somali that two men on a motorcycle blocked his way, ordered him to get out of the car and then shot him dead.  The reason for the attack was not known although al-Shabab has in the past assassinated government officials, civil servants, soldiers and elders.

<br><br>
Egypt on Wednesday executed nine suspected Muslim Brotherhood members who'd been convicted of involvement in the 2015 assassination of the country's top prosecutor, according to security officials.
<br><br>
The killing of Hisham Barakat was the first assassination of a senior official in Egypt in a quarter century.

The United States and its European allies say a new flare-up of fighting in South Sudan violates the country's peace agreement.  They are demanding the clashes end immediately.
<br><br>
A joint statement Wednesday from the U.S., Britain and Norway says the fighting around the town of Yei represents a "flagrant breach" of a December 2017 cease-fire and the revitalized peace deal signed by South Sudan's government and several rebel groups last September.

The Vatican has expressed its appreciation to sex abuse victims who've testified about their experiences with priests and higher-ranking clerics.
<br><br>
Juan Carlos Cruz from Chile is a survivor of abuse.  "I don't see any new avenues other than applying with rigor and this culture of abuse and this culture of coverup by bishops, no matter where in the world they are, needs to end.  That is critical."
<br><br>
The Vatican summit is to begin Thursday.  It will bring together Catholic leaders from throughout the world.

U.N. and international health agencies say Venezuela's health care crisis is causing a rise in infectious diseases and the re-emergence of diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, once considered almost vanquished.
<br><br>
Correspondent Lisa Schlein reports for VOA from Geneva.
<br><br>
The World Health Organization blames Venezuela's complex political and socio-economic situation for the virtual collapse of the country's health care system.  It says the system is under stress because of a shortage of doctors and nurses who have left the country, as well as a lack of medical supplies and other factors.
<br><br>
More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil to escape what is considered the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere.

President Trump lashed out Wednesday at a report that he had asked his former acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, to put a Trump ally in charge of a federal investigation into hush money.  That money was paid during the 2016 election campaign to two women who had alleged that they had had affairs with Trump.
<br><br>
<i>The New York Times</i> reported on Tuesday that Trump called Whitaker to see if Whitaker would put the probe in the hands of Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York whom Trump had appointed.
<br><br>
The story noted that Berman had already recused himself from the case because of a conflict of interest.
<br><br>
From his Twitter account on Tuesday, Trump reacted saying "<i>The New York Times</i> reporting is false," and he again called the paper the "true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"
