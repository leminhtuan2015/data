  Mike
 </strong>
 : So Jeff, we were talking previously about your film production and your travel experiences, and have you ever had any bad experiences or any really bad experiences that stand out in your television kind of documentary production?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : Yes, there&#39;s been several --- there&#39;s been many small, uncomfortable or scary moments, but I think the
  <span class="audionotes">
   pinnacle
  </span>
  of that experience came on my birthday maybe three years ago in the Philippines Sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : And we were
  <span class="audionotes">
   shooting
  </span>
  a television documentary in the Souther Philippines and its a developing country, so the standards for safety are a little bit lower, than a developed country like America or Japan, so we were on a boat. We had charted a boat to go across the Philippines Sea from one island to another, and just after
  <span class="audionotes">
   dusk
  </span>
  at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : You were doing like a film shoot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : Yeah, we were filming down there for two weeks in the Southern Philippines, and we charted this boat so we had all out gear. We had our camera crew. We had everything on the boat going from one island to another, and just after dusk. after it had got dark, the boat sank.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow! You lost everything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : We lost everything, but at that moment nothing really mattered. No physical possession, or none of the film that we had shot over the last week. Nothing. It was just --- you were just worried about living, so everything else
  <span class="audionotes">
   went out the window
  </span>
  , so I was just thinking about I have to stay alive. I have to live through this.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : And I&#34;m assuming, you did stay alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m still alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s a bonus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : One of my
  <span class="audionotes">
   nine lives
  </span>
  is gone, or maybe two of them or three of them, but yeah.
