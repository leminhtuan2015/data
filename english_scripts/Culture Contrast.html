  Joel:
 </strong>
 So, Michele, how long have you been living in Japan?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Well, in total it&#39;s been almost four years now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Four years. OK. That&#39;s about the same for me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Do you feel like your
  <span class="audionotes">
   totally used to it
  </span>
  ? Are you acculturated?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  I think so. At times there are still some things that are a little bit difficult but
  <span class="audionotes">
   for the most part
  </span>
  , I don&#39;t have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   culture shock
  </span>
  anymore.

  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  For example?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  <span class="style6">
   Something that I still struggle with
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Well, there&#39;s still
  <span class="audionotes">
   the language barrier
  </span>
  because I&#39;m still not fluent in Japanese so, like today I went to the bank and I was trying to do something that was a little out of the ordinary I guess I just had some trouble and I couldn&#39;t get it done.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  And you said you had gone back to the United States...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Canada.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sorry. You had gone back to Canada and did you have kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   reverse culture shock
  </span>
  when you went back?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Yes, I did actually. I... at that time, I had lived in Japan for about three years and I returned to Canada and I was so used to living in Japan and I guess I had to change my thinking and behaviors a little bit while I was in Japan so when I went back to Canada I felt like, &#34;OK, now I have to change back.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  The first thing I noticed when I had gone back to the United States was in the grocery store, the supermarket, when I was buying my food the cashier would talk to me and ask me questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  And when I lived in Asia, the cashiers, they never talk to you, and it just threw me off. It threw me off guard. I was very surprised at how much just people you don&#39;t know will approach you and talk to you and ask you questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  And also, you&#39;re planning to move back soon again?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m going to go back Canada in the summer for my holidays but then I&#39;ll be back in Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see. What do you think you&#39;ll miss most while you&#39;re gone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  What will I miss about Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  I think I&#39;ll miss the food the most. I really love Japanese food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s exactly the same for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ll miss my

 </p>
