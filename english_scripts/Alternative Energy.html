  : My company is a wind energy company but there&#39;s a lot of other options.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
  : What are the other options and what are the
  <span class="audionotes">
   pros and cons
  </span>
  of each option?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kat
  </strong>
  : Well let&#39;s start off with wind. Wind energy is great. It doesn&#39;t take away a lot of space. You can have one wind turbine in a very small area but
  <span class="audionotes">
   on the other hand
  </span>
  you really need some strong wind to have a good output. Then you have solar energy. Solar energy is great but you also need a very good location and solar exposure is normally just a couple of hours a day so you need a very big solar panel so it takes away a lot of space. Then we have the
  <span class="audionotes">
   option
  </span>
  of geothermal energy which is great but once again depends on where you live. Very few areas have what it takes to have a productive geothermal system and it&#39;s very expensive. There&#39;s a lot of drilling involved. Then another option is bio-energy which is where you actually take animal waste and use that to make energy. I think it&#39;s one of the better ones but once again the set up is highly expensive. Then a last option would be hydro-energy. Hydro-energy I think is best in very large set ups, government-run or run by large electricity companies. It&#39;s very expensive to set up but once it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   set up
  </span>
  , it&#39;s a very, very productive way of making energy.
