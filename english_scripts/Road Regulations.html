  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : OK, Nathan. So we&#39;re talking about driving and are there any rules or regulations that you&#39;d like to change?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : You know what, Jules, that an interesting question. I&#39;m not sure that I want to change rules but I&#39;d like the police to be stricter on the rules. Like if people jump the traffic lights, I don&#39;t know why there isn&#39;t a camera at every set of traffic lights just to stop people from doing that, you know. Or like speeding. It&#39;s very, very easy to put speed cameras in places but people seem to think that it&#39;s OK like the speed limit is the minimum speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Maybe the car manufacturers should have some responsibility then in maybe limiting their engine. What&#39;s the point in producing an engine that&#39;s big enough and powerful enough that you can go like two hundred kilometres an hour when the speed limits are only...have you ever driven in Germany where they don&#39;t have speed limits?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ve been to Germany and been a passenger in a car but not driven, no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ve been a passenger on the
  <span class="audionotes">
   autobahns
  </span>
  . I really enjoyed it actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Is that because you&#39;re a
  <span class="audionotes">
   speed demon
  </span>
  -
  <span class="audionotes">
   adrenaline freak
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : I like the freedom.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : And I think it takes away a lot of the road rage element.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : I think people do drive responsibly. Often people break laws simply because the laws are there, you know. If the law isn&#39;t there, people drive within their ability range so the autobahns they&#39;re, as far as I know, I think they have a high safety rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Yeah, they have less accidents because when you&#39;ve got speed limits this creates situations that actually present dangers on the road.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Do those people then maybe I guess in Germany they maybe have better education about self responsibility when driving maybe?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Possibly. They also have very good cars, very safe cars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : And you know if you&#39;ve got like a Porsche or something that can go at that speed then it&#39;s so nice to be able to do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Use it properly?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Yeah, and safely because you know there&#39;s not going to be somebody in that outside lane obeying the speed limit to the letter who&#39;s going to present a danger to you. You&#39;re free, you can go at the speed you want. If there&#39;s people that want to drive slow, they have a lane that they can drive more slowly in.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : So it kind of balances out. I think it&#39;s the restrictions that create the danger sometimes, based on the autobahns.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Obviously driving through a
  <span class="audionotes">
   residential area
  </span>
  or where there&#39;s a school you&#39;ve got to have, but I think those things we have in the UK, those speed policemen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Speed bumps.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Those
  <span class="audionotes">
   speed bumps
  </span>
  that force you to slow down, I think they&#39;re a good idea and perhaps the way to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : To go, so you don&#39;t think fining people is useful?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Not really, no, because that relies on the police time and the police don&#39;t have time to police every single driver all the time and do that.
