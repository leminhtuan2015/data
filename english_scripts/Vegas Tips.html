  Lupe:
 </strong>
 My mom is actually interested in going to Vegas. She&#39;s never been there and she knows you and I have been there quite a few times, so she was wondering maybe if we could give her some
 <span class="audionotes">
  do&#39;s and don&#39;ts
 </span>
 about going to Vegas because she&#39;s never been there and I sort of explained to her some of the good things about Vegas and some of the things she shouldn&#39;t do, but I think I&#39;m missing a few things. What do you think?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Well, I think the most important thing about Las Vegas is to wear comfortable shoes. You do so much walking there it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   ridiculous
  </span>
  so I think to wear flat comfortable shoes, tennis shoes, whatever you&#39;re most comfortable in. I&#39;ve had many days or nights with blisters all over my feet, so that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   the number one &#39;do&#39;
  </span>
  : wear comfortable shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true. I did forget about that just because, you know, staying there either you take a cab everywhere, but most people want to do sightseeing and looking at the different hotels, it&#39;s a really beautiful place so she will be doing a lot of walking, so I&#39;ll definitely
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep that in mind
  </span>
  and let her know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Another thing I would say is to wear comfortable clothing because when you walk into the casino, if you go in the summer, it&#39;s extremely warm there: a hundred degrees or more, and even in the middle of the night it&#39;s still that warm outside, but when you walk into the casinos, they have the air-conditioning set at seventy degrees, so outside you get really, really warm and then inside you start getting really cold, so it&#39;s good to
  <span class="audionotes">
   dress in layers
  </span>
  and to be comfortable whatever you&#39;re wearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  And remember the first time you and I went, I did think it was a bit too long of a trip so maybe I should tell her to keep it short because it can get really expensive after a few days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Vegas isn&#39;t a place you wanna be more than three days. You&#39;ve had a enough gambling, enough shows, enough sightseeing, it&#39;s about time to head home, so I would say to keep it short. It&#39;s close enough, you can always go back, but...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  And definitely bring enough money because after being there for four days the last time we were there, we did run out of money. So I should definitely tell her that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  That we did but your mom doesn&#39;t shop as much as us, so I think she&#39;ll do OK as long as she stays away from the slot machines.
