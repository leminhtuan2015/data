    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So Akane, what do you think about children today having mobile phones?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Mobile phones? Well, I mean, I think they could be a good thing, I mean for safety reasons.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Really?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yes if I was a parent I think I would feel safer knowing that my child had a mobile phone and I could get in touch with them whenever I need to and if something happens like an emergency then they will be able to use the mobile phone.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   You see I would argue that they’re quite dangerous actually, because children don’t really have the best attention spans anyway and often they could, for example, walk into the road whilst they were talking on their mobile phone and generally not pay attention so I don’t think they’re very safe.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well that’s a good point but that could also teach them responsibility as well. If mobile phones are unsafe, I mean bicycles could be unsafe and toys could be unsafe, but that’s all part of growing up and I think that if you teach them responsibility, it shouldn’t be a big problem.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   But I think fewer children these days play on bikes than they used to; I think children are more dependent upon technology and I see that as, as a definite negative thing because children don’t play out as they used to before. They just stay in and watch TV and play on computer games.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   True, true. I suppose so, but you know technology is a necessity in our lives and in the future if we want them to become competent in using technology and taking advantage of technology then I think it would be a good way to start.

    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Don’t you think they are really expensive though? I mean, don’t…
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh yeah, they are.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   If I was a parent though I would not want my child to be phoning people left, right and centre because it would cost so much money.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well you could be right about that. They do cost a lot of money.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, I’m glad you agree. Well, yeah, like at least we agree about something now.

   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   For sure.
