  Erina:
 </strong>
 So Mike, I heard that you box?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well I don&#39;t box any more but I was boxing, mostly kick boxing for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Wow, that sounds crazy. How did you
  <span class="audionotes">
   get into
  </span>
  it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, from a young age, from about the age of twelve, I started doing karate in Vancouver and I was training in karate for about seven or eight years and then once I graduated from high school I moved and I moved to Japan and there I continued and didn&#39;t have much time to do training but I got involved in the
  <span class="audionotes">
   kick boxing circle
  </span>
  with some friends that did a lot of kick boxing and different types of martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Wow, kick boxing, so I assume the training is pretty hard too, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the training was
  <span class="audionotes">
   brutal
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  What kind of training do you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, I was never professional but I had a couple of amateur fights and I don&#39;t think people quite understand how much goes into one fight because leading up to the fight, a couple of months before the fight, a friend of mine and I would be training at least five times a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  And we would do really brutal
  <span class="audionotes">
   sprints
  </span>
  up a hill over and over again and we&#39;d do interval training on the sand and in addition, of course, we were doing lots of
  <span class="audionotes">
   sparring
  </span>
  and lots of conditioning and stuff that would just really
  <span class="audionotes">
   push your body to the limit
  </span>
  and really test you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Wow, that must have been very tough. So were you ever worried about head injuries?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, especially with boxing, you get a lot of head injuries and more so over time because unlike other martial arts, boxing is designed to keep you standing and taking hits and that&#39;s why you see a lot of professional boxers as they get older and near the end of their career or even after their career, a lot of them have severe brain damage. Their speech is
  <span class="audionotes">
   impeded
  </span>
  and you can tell that they&#39;ve really done some damage to their head over the years.
