   Sarah
  </strong>
  : John, tell me about your day. What time
  <span class="audiodef">
   do
  </span>
  you wake-up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, let&#39;s see. Some days I
  <span class="audiodef">
   wake up
  </span>
  early. Maybe about 6 o&#39;clock. Yeah, sometimes I
  <span class="audiodef">
   wake up
  </span>
  at 6 o&#39;clock.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I
  <span class="audiodef">
   get
  </span>
  up early, I like to
  <span class="audiodef">
   get ready
  </span>
  for the day,
  <span class="audiodef">
   take a shower
  </span>
  and
  <span class="audiodef">
   have breakfast
  </span>
  . But other days, I
  <span class="audiodef">
   don&#39;t like
  </span>
  getting up early. Maybe I&#39;ll sleep in until 10:00 or 11:00.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I
  <span class="audiodef">
   like
  </span>
  sleeping in late. So sometimes, I
  <span class="audiodef">
   wake up
  </span>
  at 11:00. On those days, if I know I won&#39;t wake up until 11:00, I&#39;ll take a shower the night before, before I go to bed. How about you, Sarah? When do you usually
  <span class="audiodef">
   wake up
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Well, I
  <span class="audiodef">
   like
  </span>
  everyday to be the same.  So I
  <span class="audiodef">
   wake up
  </span>
  everyday at 8 o&#39;clock.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : 8:00.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : 8:00. And I always do the same thing. First, I make coffee right away. Then I wake up my kids and we have breakfast together at about 8:30.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yes. We usually have something easy like bread and yogurt and fruit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : I like to have coffee every morning whether I wake up at 6:00 or at 10:00. I&#39;m still going to have coffee. But I often skip breakfast. Do you always eat breakfast everyday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yes. If I don&#39;t eat breakfast, I&#39;m so hungry. What about lunch? What time do you have lunch?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Lunch is the same everyday for me. I always eat lunch at 12:30 PM. So whenever I wake up, I do some things and then I always have lunch at 12:30 PM, just half past noon. And I always have a simple lunch. Maybe some soup or spaghetti or a sandwich. Something light, and it&#39;s always at half past noon. What time do you eat lunch?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s interesting. I have breakfast at the same time everyday but lunch is always at a different time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Because I&#39;m busy in the morning. I go out, maybe I go shopping. Sometimes, I clean the house. So I might have lunch at 11 o&#39;clock or 12 o&#39;clock. Sometimes as late as 2:30.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s getting late.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yes. But it&#39;s always easy lunch like you. Maybe crackers and cheese or a sandwich or a baked potato.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : I see.
