  Todd:
 </strong>
 Devon, I&#39;ve been
 <span class="audionotes">
  putting on
 </span>
 a few pounds and you&#39;re quite a lean fit guy.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  Well, thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do you recommend? What can I do to
  <span class="audionotes">
   lose weight
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  Well, I exercise a lot. I go running at least three times a week. More than that, I enjoy playing sports. Different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Actually, one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  Do you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so maybe it&#39;s my diet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat. Maybe, I eat three meals a day and I try not to
  <span class="audionotes">
   snack
  </span>
  in between. No potato chips. No popcorn. No candy bars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty
  <span class="audiodef">
   tough
  </span>
  !
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  It is
  <span class="audionotes">
   tough
  </span>
  but......Well, I must admit that I cheat every once in awhile but...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ok, I&#39;ll give it a try. Actually, you see my problem is that I like
  <span class="audionotes">
   junk food
  </span>
  . I have to choose, either I eat less or I eat a better diet. What do you think is more important?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  I think that if you are exercising then you should just eat what you want and eat less.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Eat less. OK. This is going to be tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  Well, I have no doubt that you will do the best that you can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Alright! Thanks a lot Devon.
