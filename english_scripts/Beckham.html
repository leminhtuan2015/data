   Todd:
  </strong>
  Lois, I noticed that you have a poster of David Beckham by your desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I do. I think that David Beckham is quite a handsome man. I also think that he is a very, very talented footballer, although his recent performance in Euro 2004 was maybe not quite what it should have been, he did miss two penalties but, I think in the past he has been a very good role model for people in England and a very good footballer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what is it about David Beckham that everyone thinks is handsome?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Everything about him is perfect. He&#39;s got a lovely body, great hair, when he has hair, and then when he doesn&#39;t have hair, he has a great shaped head. The only thing I don&#39;t really like about his body is his tattoos. He&#39;s just had a new tattoo on the back of his neck, and I think it is a cross with some Angels wings on it, and I don&#39;t think that is very nice, but apart from that I would say that he is perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh! Well, what color are his eyes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I have not idea what color his eyes are! Um, no! I&#39;m guessing brown but, I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and how tall is he?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  How tall is he? Taller than me, but I don&#39;t know how tall he is either. No details, details. So do you think David Beckham is a better football player or a better model?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Whoa! Tricky! Um, possibly at the moment a better model, and maybe he should spend less time concentrating on that and more time on his football.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mm! Well, how old is he now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I think he&#39;s about 29. Yeah, because his wife just turned 30 a couple of months ago, and he&#39;s one year younger, so he&#39;s 29.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Does he have any children?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  He has two children. I don&#39;t know how old they are. One is called Brooklyn and the other one is called Romeo, not really sure where they got their names from, but yeah, two young children.
