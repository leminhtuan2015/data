  Maria
 </strong>
 : So talking about social media, is your parents on any social sites like Facebook, Twitter, et cetera.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : My mum and dad are on Facebook. My mum doesn&#39;t use hers, she uses hers only to kind of see what I&#39;m doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  :
  <span class="audionotes">
   Stalk
  </span>
  you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Kind of yeah. My dad, he&#39;s on Facebook every once in a while. Again, he does kind of stalk me as well because he, he&#39;s very
  <span class="audionotes">
   paranoid
  </span>
  about Facebook, about social media sites so every once in a while I get an email from him and it will be like just so you know this was on your profile and you need to change it or this, or one of your friends commented or put a video on and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s appropriate if a job seeker looking for you. And I keep telling him I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   unsearchable
  </span>
  , you know, like you can&#39;t find me but so he only uses it to make himself more paranoid. My mum got Twitter before I did.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I still don&#39;t have it. She got it for her job. She&#39;s working as a chief medical officer so she got it for her company, the start up company she&#39;s working for and I don&#39;t know, her opinion originally was that it was for people who are really, really
  <span class="audionotes">
   self-centered
  </span>
  and wanted to tell everyone about what they were feeling and now she&#39;s like this thing&#39;s actually kind of fun. So she&#39;s enjoying that. Both of my parents are on Skype annoyingly often. My dad travels a lot so he has to use Skype to get in contact with my mum. The video feature is really, really good for that, so they&#39;re on almost every night I think to each other. I usually receive stuff from them just like overnight or something when they&#39;re doing stuff like that, but Twitter is my mum&#39;s thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : How do you feel about having your parents on these social media sites?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : In some way, you know, it&#39;s good, like if, I don&#39;t talk to them ever on social media sites. Well I do it by Skype or something like that. I don&#39;t do it on Facebook. I don&#39;t do it on Twitter, although I don&#39;t have Twitter so it doesn&#39;t make a difference but, you know, Facebook, I&#39;m, I don&#39;t know, I think it&#39;s a bit odd honestly. My parents, there&#39;s some stuff on there, you know, it&#39;s for my friends. It&#39;s not really for them so, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s, I feel it can be a bit awkward. My mum has said hey I was looking at your Facebook site the other day and, you know, you instantly go sshhh, oh dear, you
  <span class="audionotes">
   bristle
  </span>
  , you know, you get nervous because you&#39;re like what did she find, so yeah good stuff.
