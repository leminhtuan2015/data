   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hello, I&#39;m here with Frederick. Now frederick, you went to university in Canada?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right, Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and you have very strong views about universities in Canada. Can you please explain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  OK, well, let me just
  <span class="audionotes">
   give you a general idea
  </span>
  of how education works in Canada. We don&#39;t have private universities in Canada. They&#39;re all public. Now what that means is that the universities are owned by the government, so there is the Ministry of Education that&#39;s in charge of creating the curriculum for the universities and so
  <span class="audionotes">
   there&#39;s not much room for flexibility
  </span>
  and since it&#39;s a government operated institution, things don&#39;t move very fast. If you want something to be done then their workers do not have so much incentive to help you because he&#39;s a worker for the government, and so I think it&#39;s not very efficient, however there are certain advantages of public universities, such as the fees being free, you don&#39;t have to pay for your education and so it&#39;s open for everybody and that&#39;s also one of Canada&#39;s main idea is to provide free education to everybody, but the system is slow. It is inefficient and does not work that well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But, yeah, I can see your point but in the United States we have many private universities and I think they&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   large bureaucracies
  </span>
  also and maybe people don&#39;t act that much differently because somebody working for a private university, it&#39;s the same thing. They get paid for their job. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re that much more motivated to help people. Also, we have a problem in the United States that usually only wealthy kids go to the best schools and it&#39;s kind of a problem actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  I agree with you. I think that it is a problem because you&#39;re not giving the same
  <span class="audionotes">
   equal access
  </span>
  to education to everybody, only a few selected people can go to the best and the others go to the maybe less good universities. I agree with you that it&#39;s not easy but having only public universities might not be the best solution. Perhaps providing public university but also private university such as Japan for example where they have a system of private and public universities.  Now, in Japan public university are considered to be the best and private universities are considered to be less good that public universities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. It&#39;s the
  <span class="audionotes">
   exact opposite
  </span>
  in the States
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  So, as you see, it&#39;s hard to see which one is better.
