   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hey Todd, what is your hometown?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : My hometown is San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, nice. Is your town beautiful?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yes. San Francisco is very beautiful. It has a nice view of the ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Sounds nice. Is your town clean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s pretty clean. Sometimes, it&#39;s dirty. Some places are dirty, but usually, the city is clean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh. Is San Francisco dangerous?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No, it&#39;s not too dangerous. Sometimes, we have crime, but it&#39;s safe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Great. Is your town expensive?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yes. San Francisco is very expensive. Everything is expensive. Food is expensive. Housing is expensive. Shopping is expensive. Everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, really? Is San Francisco famous?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yes. It&#39;s very famous. In America, it&#39;s famous for its bridge. We have the Golden Gate Bridge. It&#39;s the world&#39;s most famous bridge, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I know that bridge. Is your town hot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Never. San Francisco is never hot. It&#39;s never super cold, but it&#39;s never hot. It&#39;s always warm or cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Sounds great. Is San Francisco interesting?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I think so. It&#39;s a very interesting city. We have people from everywhere, and we have good food. We have nature nearby, and we have interesting buildings.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow. I&#39;d like to go there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ooh, you should. What about your city? What&#39;s your city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : My city is Chicago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ooh, Chicago. Chicago. Is your city beautiful?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes. It&#39;s very beautiful, with lots of tall buildings and a big lake.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ooh, nice. Is Chicago clean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Some parts of Chicago are clean, and other parts are a little dirty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : How about dangerous? Is Chicago dangerous?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Similarly, some parts are dangerous and some parts are safe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. San Francisco is the same. I think every American city is the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I think that&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Most places are safe, but some places are dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Is Chicago expensive?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes. Because it&#39;s such a big city, almost everything is expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Food, attractions, parking, entertainment, everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Sounds like San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I think so, a little similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Is it hot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It can be hot in the summer. Usually July or August, it gets hot sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Is it interesting?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes, of course. Chicago is very interesting. We have many museums, and things to do, and we also have nature. At the lake, you can go and enjoy a day on the beach.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Is Chicago by the ocean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s not by the ocean. It&#39;s by a really big lake called Lake Michigan. What about San Francisco? Is it by the ocean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, San Francisco is on the ocean. It&#39;s on the Pacific Ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : o we have really nice beaches.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Do you like the beach?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I do, but the beaches in San Francisco are a little cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : In Los Angeles, they&#39;re warm, but Los Angeles is not interesting, and it&#39;s expensive, and it&#39;s not beautiful, so I don&#39;t like Los Angeles.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So we should stick with San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Or Chicago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  :  Okay.
