 Hey, Mike, how&#39;s it going?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Good! How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m alright. So you&#39;re from Florida right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, I went to college in Florida.

  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Why did you choose Florida?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, the weather is similar to Hawaii, where I&#39;m from, and I also got a
  <span class="audionotes">
   scholarship
  </span>
  to play soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow, so you play soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I played midfield for my college for four years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Wow, you must be really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know about that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Where was your university?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  It was in the Tampa Bay area, right on the bay, on Tampa Bay, and it&#39;s surrounded by the city of Tampa and Clearwater.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  So what is there to do in Tampa Bay?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s a lot of things. You can go fishing, boating, sailing, or kayaking. We used to do all of that when I was there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Wow, sounds like a really great city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was really fun if you like the outdoors type of thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari
  </strong>
  : Do you think it&#39;s the best city in Florida?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think it&#39;s a good location. It&#39;s right in the middle of Florida so you can go to Miami. It&#39;s a few hours away drive, or to Orlando, that has Disneyworld.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Wow. Sounds like a really great place. Can you tell me about the weather?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  The weather&#39;s really nice in Florida most of the year, which is one reason why I went from Hawaii but in the summer time it gets really hot and when it gets hot you really need air-conditioning, but that&#39;s not problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Does it rain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Actually in the summertime, there&#39;s really bad lighting storms. It&#39;s always... It lasts for about
  <span class="audionotes">
   half an hour
  </span>
  but it&#39;s always between three and five o&#39;clock in the evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Sounds pretty scary?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but when you&#39;re inside it&#39;s OK. It&#39;s kind of cool to watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Is there something you don&#39;t like about Florida?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  The only thing I don&#39;t like is the bugs. There&#39;s so many
  <span class="audionotes">
   bugs
  </span>
  , especially during summer time. And really scary ants, and bugs you can&#39;t even see and they
  <span class="audionotes">
   end up
  </span>
  biting you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Wow. Sounds pretty scary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but as long as you have bug
  <span class="audionotes">
   repellant
  </span>
  when you go outside in the summer, there&#39;s no problem.
