   Rory
  </b>
  : So Abidemi, let&#39;s talk about abilities. Can you cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Yes, and no. I can cook a little bit, the basic stuff but I really like to eat but I don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   experiment
  </span>
  too much. So no, I&#39;m not a great cook, but I can cook. I cook to survive. What about you, Rory? Can you cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah, I can. I really like cooking. I love cooking Italian food. I also love baking. So I can bake cakes and cookies and bread, stuff like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Okay.

   Rory
  </b>
  : How about singing? Can you sing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : I think I can sing. Yes, I enjoy singing. I love singing. I sing a lot in church, so I can sing. What about you? Can you sing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : I can&#39;t sing
  <span class="audionotes">
   at all
  </span>
  . Like even when I go to karaoke, I&#39;m too embarrassed to pick up the microphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Oh, it&#39;s too bad. What about you, Rory, can you play – okay, can you play an instrument?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : I can&#39;t. No. I&#39;d love to be able to play an instrument but I can&#39;t play anything. How about you? Can you play an instrument?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : No, I can&#39;t. I really wish that I had learned something when I was younger. But I say I can play my voice. Ha, ha.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : That&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : What about juggling? Can you juggle, Rory?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah, I can juggle. I can juggle with three balls and I can almost juggle with four.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Like I can do it for about 10 seconds. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : I can&#39;t juggle at all. So please teach me. It&#39;s always something that I&#39;ve always wanted – I wanted to learn.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Okay. Can you speak three languages?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Yes. I think I can speak three languages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Which ones?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : I think English is my best language but I also speak Yoruba, a Nigerian language, and I speak French
  <span class="audionotes">
   as well
  </span>
  . Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  And you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Well, I can speak English and I can speak
  <span class="audionotes">
   some
  </span>
  Czech. I lived in the Czech Republic for six years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : And I can also speak a little bit of French but it&#39;s very
  <span class="audionotes">
   rusty
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Okay. Maybe next time we&#39;ll have this conversation in French then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Okay.
