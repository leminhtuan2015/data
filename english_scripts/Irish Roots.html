  OK, and your heritage is..?

   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. What part of Ireland were they from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  They&#39;re from Galway City.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Where is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s on the west coast of Ireland. It&#39;s really beautiful there. Absolutely gorgeous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Great, and do they move to England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Yeah, my grandfather actually came over to become a priest, but obviously he didn&#39;t. So yeah, then, he met my grandmother who also come over from England and then they got married. So, yeah, my name is an Irish name. Kate&#39;s an Irish name and Kenny as well, my surname. It&#39;s a very Irish name.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Wow, so now what was it like having Irish grandparents in England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  I think initially for them it was difficult when they first came over because there weren&#39;t many jobs for the Irish and there as quite a lot of prejudice against the Irish, but it&#39;s wonderful having Irish heritage because there&#39;s such funny warm kind people. Really interesting. They can tell a good story so it was great to have that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so have you been to Ireland?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah. Many times. Yeah.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Did you go and see where they grew up and...yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a beautiful place. I&#39;ve been there lots of times. I want to go back. Definitely. Really lovely country and the people are so friendly. It&#39;s so beautiful there.
