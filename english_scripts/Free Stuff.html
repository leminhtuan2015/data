   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Diego, I hear your graduation soon. Congratulations.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Thank you. Yes, I&#39;m graduation this month.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Really, and what about all the stuff you have in your apartment? What are you going to do with it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Well, because I am moving to another city, I&#39;m trying to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get rid of
  </span>
  everything, so I&#39;m trying to sell most of the stuff to get a little bit of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Well, what kind of stuff do you have? Maybe I can buy some from you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I have this blender. It&#39;s in really good shape. And it makes really good smoothies, and I also wanna get rid of my fridge. It&#39;s a big, nice fridge, so I think it fits everywhere nicely, so if you know anyone who wants these things, you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   let me know
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  OK, maybe I can have the blender, but the fridge, maybe not. I already have a big fridge as well, but I can ask a friend if they need a fridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I have a lot of silverware so if you know anyone who is interested in a fridge, I can
  <span class="audionotes">
   thrown in
  </span>
  the silverware just as a bonus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  OK, I&#39;ll let them know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  And then in the living room, well, I have a TV and a couch that I have no idea what to do with, so because you&#39;re helping me you can take the TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Well, that will be great. I don&#39;t have a TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  But you have to get rid of the couch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK, so I have a big couch in my living room, and my living room is quite small, so ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Maybe you can just
  <span class="audionotes">
   give it away
  </span>
  to one of your friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Buy you&#39;ll need to help me get that sofa out of my apartment. It&#39;s quite big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s OK, I can help. I can help.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  As for the bedroom, I have a big bed, so I need to get rid of that, and it&#39;s a really nice bed. It&#39;s really, really big so I think it&#39;s quite comfortable, so it shouldn&#39;t be too hard sell.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s a nice bed, but maybe it&#39;s a little bit big for my room.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  OK, what about your roommates? Do you know if anyone would want it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ll ask. I&#39;ll ask and let you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I also have some stuff in the bathroom I want to get rid of.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Do you have a mirror because mine just broke.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes, I have a large mirror in the bathroom, so that wouldn&#39;t be that expensive, so if you want it I can sell it to you for like 30 dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  OK, that would be great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  OK, so
  <span class="audionotes">
   we have a deal
  </span>
  .
