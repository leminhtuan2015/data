   Matt:
  </strong>
  Hey, Rachel, so do you read the newspaper these days?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Actually, no. I used to get a newspaper delivered and I didn&#39;t read it at all, so I cancelled it cause I was worried about wasting trees, and wasting paper and therefore trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Right, right. Yeah, me neither. I don&#39;t get any of my news from Newspapers themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  So how do you find out what&#39;s going on?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Most times I just look on the Internet, and I&#39;ve got, you know ... my first page that
  <span class="audionotes">
   pops up
  </span>
  lists about six or seven headlines, and actually I find myself clicking on them quite a bit. You know, you see one sentence is enough to
  <span class="audionotes">
   draw me in
  </span>
  , and then I end up reading online my news.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, me too. But I&#39;m a bit worried about it because I always like, when you can choose news, which news article to read you tend to just choose the light entertainment article or maybe not the really serious news as much as you would if was on the front page.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Right, right. And I wonder where those headlines, like, who chooses what appears? So I worry about that too. But I wonder in the future if they&#39;ll even be newspapers anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  I heard that they are actually really struggling to make money and even the most famous newspapers are starting to
  <span class="audionotes">
   go bankrupt
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  And what ...? Do you think those companies will
  <span class="audionotes">
   make a shift
  </span>
  to being completely online then at some point?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think they would have to. Yeah, yeah. Which is
  <span class="audionotes">
   a shame
  </span>
  because I mean cause I like the idea of the newspaper.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Right, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Do you think books will disappear though?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  That I don&#39;t know. I mean I think a lot of people ... like you were maybe saying, but like the feel of a book and like and I think people reading on a screen. I&#39;ve never been able to read a book online. Me neither. I&#39;ve always only read through something I can hold and take with me anywhere. But these days with the little handheld units! Have you ever tried to read online? Like read an actual novel?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  No, I just don&#39;t like the idea of it. I don&#39;t think my eyes could take that sort of electronic screen for like 300 pages, so no.
