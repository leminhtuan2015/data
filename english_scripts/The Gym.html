 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why? What do you mean? Why do you have to?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  When I went to the USA, I gained a lot. 20 pounds. That was too much for me. So I decided to go to
  <span class="audiodef">
   lose weight
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  <span class="audiodef">
   If possible
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How did you lose weight?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  I go to the gym and run, maybe 20 minutes. I&#39;m too lazy. I can&#39;t keep running for hours. And anyway, soI do aerobics. Do you say aerobics?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Aerobics.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yes. Aerobics or something like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. That&#39;s it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s it. And sometimes I swim. Yeah, but I like aerobics better than swimming.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Because it&#39;s fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  And the music and dancing. Yeah, it&#39;s more fun for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  When you lost the weight did you also diet or did you just exercise?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  I just exercised cause I like eating. I love eating. I can&#39;t stop doing that, so... but I try my best not to eat chocolate too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s your
  <span class="audiodef">
   weakness
  </span>
  . Chocolate.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Well, you look great so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Oh, thank you. You&#39;re so nice.

   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Kate, how do you normally spend your evenings?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve joined the gym here, so I go and exercise and go for a swim.
 </p>

   </a>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Swim. How long do you stay each time?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  About 2 hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Wow. So what do you do during those two hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  So we go to the gym for about an hour and then have a swim for half an hour and then sauna for about ten minutes and then finish off with a massage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Really, a massaging chair?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  A massaging chair!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Wonderful, and so who do you go with?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  I go with Nicola.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  And Nicola is?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  She&#39;s another teacher and she&#39;s who I live with, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Alright, good, good, good, good. Now when you&#39;re in the gym, do you do weights? Do you do cardio? Aerobics? Running? Walking?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  We do everything really. Aerobics and weights.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Aerobics and weights are the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  The gyms here are much better than back home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah. What&#39;s the biggest difference?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  They have games on the machines so if you&#39;re cycling, you&#39;re also playing a game where you have to blow up the other cyclists so it makes it a bit more interesting than just exercising.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh! So it passes the time by. Yeah, lot quicker. And then why are you exercising? Do you have a certain reason, a goal in mind?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Yeah, because I put on a lot of weight when I was in Australia because I was eating too much pizza and, good breakfast, and drinking far too much beer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  So you just want to shed those extra pounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that I put on and get back to the original weight that I was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Well, good luck to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Thank you.
