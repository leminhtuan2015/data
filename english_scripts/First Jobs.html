  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : So Adam, how old were you when you got your first job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : I was 16 but actually my dad tried to get me to work at Baskin &amp; Robbins when I was 15. And the manager wouldn’t hire me because I was under
  <span class="audionotes">
   legal working age
  </span>
  in the States.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : How old are you when you first started working?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I started working when I was 14. I’m from North Carolina in the States. And there, you are legally able to work at the age of 14. So I worked as a DJ. My father owns a radio station, so I became a DJ at age 14.

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : That’s amazing. What sort of things did you talk about as a DJ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : It was mainly a programming situation, an AM radio station. So I don’t have to talk much. It was mainly just operating the board. And a few commercials, and weather and things like that I would have to talk. But mostly, it was just pressing buttons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : Did you play any music?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Some music, depending on the time of day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : Could you play what you wanted or did you have to follow a script?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : No, you have a follow a format pretty much, so. So what’s been the most interesting or exciting job you’ve ever had?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : I worked at an airport fueling airplanes when I was in college. And I drove a
  <span class="audionotes">
   fuel truck
  </span>
  around the
  <span class="audionotes">
   tarmac
  </span>
  and fueled airplanes, big commercial airplanes like 747s and also small private prop planes just with two passengers. That was a really interesting, interesting job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : It sounds kind of slightly dangerous or maybe a lot of responsibility. Was it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : Yeah. If you – because you’re driving this large truck around very, very expensive planes, so a lot of responsibility. It wasn’t so much dangerous, I don’t think. But yeah, it was definitely – if you made an error or had an accident, it would be a big accident.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was – the hours were not very good. I had to wake up at 4:00 in the morning to go to the airport at 5:00. And when I went home I would smell just of gasoline. But it was quite an interesting and kind of exciting job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : Yeah. How about you? What’s your most interesting job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Most interesting, I guess, for me was I was hired by a car company one time to go and do like test drive demonstrations on like different cities around the US. And I had to, like, ride around with people doing the test drive and tell them about the vehicles, which was interesting because I really know nothing about cars. So I had to memorize a lot of information. But it was fun getting to go to different cities in the US every weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : Wow, cool. What car company did you do this for?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I did that for Kia but I’ve also worked for Hummer, and Ferrari and BMW.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : Wow. That’s amazing. Were those separate contracts for Ferrari, Hummer and BMW?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. For those, I didn’t do test drives. I was, what&#39;s called a promotional model or a brand ambassador. So the companies hire local people when they&#39;re an event in a certain area. And most of the time, you’re just getting people to
  <span class="audionotes">
   fill out
  </span>
  surveys or do some kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   prize drawing
  </span>
  . But in the case of Kia, it was actually doing test drives.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : Did you get any free merchandise or vehicles from any of these?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I wish I got a free vehicle, but no, just the t-shirt or whatever
  <span class="audionotes">
   outfit
  </span>
  you had to wear for the promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adam
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that’s sounds really interesting. I love cars, so I’d love to do something like that.
