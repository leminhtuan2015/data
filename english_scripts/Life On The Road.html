  Julia:
 </strong>
 What about meeting people? What about like a social life or just basic human interaction? How does that work?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Usually you meet lots of people but there&#39;s a couple of things you need to do. One is I usually stay away from anything touristy or where the tourists are because people just assume you&#39;re a tourist and nobody will
  <span class="audionotes">
   bother
  </span>
  to meet you. The best place to meet people though is a gym. So in every city, I would go to, I would sign up for a gym for two weeks or one month and you always meet people there. So gyms are great, you meet people right after work. You kind of feel like you&#39;re in a
  <span class="audionotes">
   normal work flow
  </span>
  . Parks, you meet a lot of people in parks. You go to where the local people are, maybe a food court or libraries, stuff like that, so usually places where people are actually trying to do something productive, either study or exercise or whatever, you meet people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  That was going to be my next question. What about your health? How do you maintain a health when you&#39;re living that kind of...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, yeah, you gotta eat well and you gotta exercise. I did go to the hospital in Chiang Mai because a dog bit me. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Oh, no. Did you have to get
  <span class="audionotes">
   rabies shots
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I had to get a rabies shot and it was really cheap so in most countries healthcare is really cheap. Thailand healthcare is excellent, I mean absolutely fantastic. And you know Vietnam it&#39;s cheap. You know even in big places like Taiwan or Korea, you know, you&#39;d be surprised like it&#39;s not that expensive. You just got to go to the hospital and they&#39;ll
  <span class="audionotes">
   sew you up
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  And language problems? Did you ever have any language issues?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, usually not. I mean like I lived in Thailand for four years so I can speak Thai but like Taiwan everybody spoke really good English. I went to Korea, didn&#39;t know a word of Korean. I stayed there for six weeks working from there and everybody was so nice. A lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   gestures
  </span>
  so I
  <span class="audionotes">
   got by
  </span>
  and actually I remember getting on the plane to go home from Korea and I realized I didn&#39;t know even how to say yes and no in Korean or one, two, three, four, five and I was in their country for five weeks, six weeks. So, yeah, the Koreans were very nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So have I sold you? Would you like to give it a try?
 </p>
 <p>
  Julia: Yes, I would but I, my problem is like motivation. Like if I&#39;m not given a schedule, if I don&#39;t have deadlines, if it&#39;s all up to me, I, you know, I&#39;d just spend all day at the beach and go for a massage, maybe do some shopping, go to a club, or something. I can&#39;t see myself working when I feel like I&#39;m traveling and on holiday. I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s the catch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  The mindset, I guess yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s the hard part.
