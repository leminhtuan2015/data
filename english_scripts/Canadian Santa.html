  Anja:
 </strong>
 So, Fred, tell me, how is the Santa in Canada?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Well, Anja, I think, listening to the story that you just told me, I believe that it&#39;s quite different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Is it? How is it different?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s very different because, well, actually, Santa Claus comes on the 25th of December. He doesn&#39;t come of the 6th of December. I&#39;ve never heard that before, and so Santa Claus, well, as I just mentioned comes on the 25th, and then he has these little helpers. They&#39;re called elves. He has many of them, and also they live in the North Pole and together they work at making the toys for the kids.

  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, really, so they live in the North Pole and not in the forest like the Swiss Santa Claus?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  No, they live in the North Pole.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  That must be cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well you see, it&#39;s true yeah, you&#39;re right. It is cold but the idea is that it&#39;s Christmas and so in Canada or in the United States it is cold. There&#39;s a lot of snow and so the
  <span class="audionotes">
   image of
  </span>
  Santa Claus is actually like snow. He has a big white beard, and he&#39;s dressed in this red suit, you know, and he also has a wife.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, he does?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Mama Santa Claus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, really, I didn&#39;t know that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so they work together at bringing the kids their gifts that they&#39;ve ordered, because you see in Canada the kids, maybe
  <span class="audionotes">
   a month ealier
  </span>
  ...or two, three weeks before the 25th write a list of what they want for Christmas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. That must be a pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   long list
  </span>
  . I remember when I was a kid, I always had a lot of things I wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think so, so Santa Claus has a lot of work right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, poor Santa Claus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  And so the kids write a list, and so
  <span class="audionotes">
   for instance
  </span>
  if somebody wants a bike, he writes, &#39;I want a bike&#39; and then the list is being sent to the address in the North Pole. Santa Claus takes this into consideration, meaning that if the kid has been good all
  <span class="audionotes">
   through the year
  </span>
  , he will be receiving that gift, but if he hasn&#39;t, then maybe he won&#39;t get the gift on the 25th.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, so better be good if you want your presents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
