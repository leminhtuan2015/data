  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, I think it is my father and my brother who is encouraging... who are
  <span class="audionotes">
   encouraging
  </span>
  me to play tennis actually. I started when I was in my first year in high school, however I played it only a year and then because.... due to, you know busies and studyings and so I started to play it again when I was a graduate... after graduating from high school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you were on the tennis team in high school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Not actually the tennis team but I was just like, as a hobby. I did it as a hobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. So are both your father and your brother really good players?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   in some sense
  </span>
  , yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Who&#39;s better, your father or your brother?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, regarding style, I think my brother is much better than my father.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Now when you play, do you prefer to play
  <span class="audionotes">
   singles or doubles
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  I prefer to play singles. You know, you have better control, actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. You don&#39;t like to play with another person?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, I can but it&#39;s that I don&#39;t play it very often playing double.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, right. It&#39;s a lot more difficult I think playing doubles.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes. Yes. Yes. You know, you have to get all the strategies fixed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. So, what do you think is the most difficult thing about playing tennis?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Difficult thing about playing tennis?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is it for example serving the ball or
  <span class="audionotes">
   backhand
  </span>
  , or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, I think like controlling the ball, that is the most difficult one. Like for example, like you want to hit it like, so that the ball would go, how do you say, straight to the, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   the boundary lines
  </span>
  that will be harder for your opponent to catch it, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right. That&#39;s true. That is true. It is kind of hard to keep the ball within the boundaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes, within the boundaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, do you have a really nice, expensive racket?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, yes, actually. It was expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It was! It&#39;s not expensive anymore?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  You know, like new fashions come along, new styles come along, new models come along, and then so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, your racket is a little old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yeah. It&#39;s outdated.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well anyway it was cool to talk to you about tennis. Thanks, Tini.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  No problem. Anytime.
