  : So do you dream a lot? Do you remember your dreams?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : I usually do. Although, I have to admit, now that I&#39;m older, I don&#39;t dream so much. It&#39;s pretty rare that I have a dream. But I will have dreams if I&#39;m really stressed or if I&#39;m really sick. So usually, every time I get sick, I notice I&#39;m sick because I have a dream. And I&#39;ll wake up in the middle of the night from some crazy dream and then I&#39;ll notice, oh wow, I&#39;m sick.
 </p>
 <p>
  So yeah, that&#39;s about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : That&#39;s very interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. Although, you know, when I was younger, I used to have all these dreams related to work. I guess they were stress related. And the craziest dream was, I was a waiter at a very fast-paced restaurant, and it was very stressful. And you had to
  <span class="audionotes">
   wait on
  </span>
  about 10 tables, and people would come in and you have to get their food fast. And if you didn&#39;t, you&#39;d get yelled at by the boss or the customers would be upset.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I used to have this dream – and this is when I was in college, that I would be sleeping and there would be a table in my room and the customers would be sitting there watching me sleep, and they would be
  <span class="audionotes">
   furious
  </span>
  because I wasn&#39;t bringing their food. I was like just sleeping in the bed right next to their table. And it was the same nightmare I had for – like again and again and again. It was crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : That&#39;s really interesting. And kind of funny, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah, I know. And it&#39;s weird how you have the same
  <span class="audionotes">
   recurring dream
  </span>
  . I used to have another dream, a nightmare when I was young. And it would be – I was riding a bicycle up like a mountain and the mountain was – like had a path that just kept going around and around the mountain. And you had to be really careful or else your bike would fall off the cliff. And then, my bike of course would go off the cliff and I would fall, fall, fall and you would wake up right before you hit the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had that dream many, many times when I was a little kid.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd

 </p>
 <p>
  <b>

 <p>
  <b>

   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. I don&#39;t dream very often but I have this one reoccurring dream also where I am in school and it&#39;s at the end of the semester and I suddenly realized that there&#39;s one class that I haven&#39;t been going to the entire semester and I&#39;m going to fail it. So I
  <span class="audionotes">
   panic
  </span>
  and I&#39;m running around like trying to find my professor to like try to figure out what I need to do or what I need to study for the final exam so that I don&#39;t fail this class.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what&#39;s really interesting about this dream is I
  <span class="audionotes">
   found out
  </span>
  a few years ago that my father has the same reoccurring dream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Wow. You know, this is going to sound crazy. I&#39;ve had that dream, too. I&#39;ve had a dream of like I
  <span class="audionotes">
   registered for a course
  </span>
  in college and I never went to the course, and I&#39;m going to get an F. And I don&#39;t even remember when I registered or where the class is but I didn&#39;t finish the class. Is that the same dream?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Exact same dream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Wow. I wonder what it means.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Maybe there&#39;s somebody out there that really knows what it means and they&#39;re like, &#34;Uh-oh, those two people are
  <span class="audionotes">
   doomed
  </span>
  .&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : There must be a lot of people with that dream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. And maybe that&#39;s it, like there&#39;s certain structures. Like I know that the bike dream that I have about falling off the cliff, I&#39;ve heard that many people have that. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Have you ever heard about the dream – I had it a couple of times, a dream where you&#39;re in class and then you suddenly notice that you don&#39;t have any clothes on and you&#39;re afraid that people are going to notice you don&#39;t have any clothes on?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : No, I&#39;ve never had that one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. That was one when I was really, really little, but yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : I&#39;ve heard that some people – a lot of people have dreams about their teeth falling out and that this means that like they&#39;re afraid of losing something in their life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Something that&#39;s really important to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Oh wow. So if you&#39;re teeth are falling, you&#39;re going to lose something.
 </p>
 <p>

  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
