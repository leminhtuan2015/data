  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Eion, why are you going to Osaka?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m going to Osaka this weekend to play a couple of gigs, with my band.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   A couple of gigs
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. I guess you might say concert rather than gig.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, in American English we&#39;d say gig.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  OK, that&#39;s --- to know. OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  For a rock band. So, what&#39;s the gig?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  One of them is in Osaka on Friday night and the next one is in Nagoya on Saturday night. They&#39;re both at relatively well-known live houses, which is a main kind of live venue for rock bands in Japan.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. That&#39;s pretty cool that you&#39;re going to be playing at
  <span class="audionotes">
   a reputable place
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s not, you know, world famous bands don&#39;t tour and play at these places but on the scene, they&#39;re decent places with decent sound systems and fairly well established.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, when you go to these places do you have to take all of your own equipment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Not all of our own equipment. In fact, compared to playing in England, we have to take relatively little. I play base so I will bring my base and just affects but use
  <span class="audionotes">
   the base amp
  </span>
  that&#39;s already there in the live house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now base, do you mean... is that the guitar?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. Base guitar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So you just have to bring the guitar and the cables?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Cables and the affects pedals. I use some affects to change the sound of the base guitar when I&#39;m playing and so I just bring that and plug it into the live house base amp that&#39;s there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s pretty convenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and... I mean, on top of that,
  <span class="audionotes">
   the PA
  </span>
  is all there and normally quite big, the main speakers that all the sound mixed through. If we were to play a gig in England or when we have played gigs in England, the standard is there&#39;s only the PA. Those speakers there. Everything else including the drum kit, the guitar amp, the base amp, which are pretty big items of equipment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s pretty big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you have to bring all of that with you and normally four or five bands will be playing together
  <span class="audionotes">
   on any given night
  </span>
  so there&#39;ll be an arrangement, Everyone will get in contact beforehand. One band will bring a drum kit. One will bring the base amp. Another band will bring guitar amp. That sort of arrangement.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s pretty neat that like one group will bring the drums and one group will bring the...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Well, in theory if you can get in contact with the other bands in advance, that&#39;s the way it would work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It doesn&#39;t sound easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  No.
