The city of Chicago has a new mayor who is breaking ground in a number of ways.  Lori Lightfoot is Chicago's first black, female leader as well as its first openly gay one.
<br><br>
She has pledged to institute police reform and fight the city's high rate of violent crime.
<br><br>
AP's Ed Donahue has more.
<br><br>
"I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of Mayor ...."
<br><br>
Lori Lightfoot's swearing-in featured two first.  "Chicago's first black woman mayor and first openly gay mayor."
<br><br>
Lightfoot is facing some challenges.  The biggest could be her plan to overhaul the Chicago Police Department.  "People cannot and should not live in neighborhoods that resemble a war zone."
<br><br>
The new mayor says there is no higher calling than restoring safety and peace to Chicago neighborhoods.  "Enough of the shooting.  Enough of the guns.  Enough of the violence."
<br><br>
The fiercest resistance to the mayor in Chicago will come from rank-and-file officers and the union that represents them.

<br><br>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said outbreaks have been recorded in 24 states.
<br><br>

U.S. Customs and Border [Patrol] Protection has announced a 16-year-old Guatemalan boy has died in custody after entering the country illegally a week ago.  He's been identified as Carlos Gregorio Hernandez-Vasquez.
<br><br>
AP's Shelley Adler reports.
<br><br>
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that border patrol apprehended the teenager in the Rio Grande Valley of south Texas on May 13 and during a welfare check this morning, the agency says, the teenager was found unresponsive.
<br><br>
While the agency did not say why the teenager was detained, it adds he was due for placement in a facility for youth operated by the Department of Health and Human Services.
<br><br>
A two-year-old child died last week after he and his mother were detained by the border patrol.

Google said Monday it's restricting China's Huawei Telecommunications Company from access to the Android operating system.
<br><br>
Google said it's making the move and compliance with the Trump administration's blacklisting of Huawei as a national security threat.
<br><br>
Millions of Huawei phones already in use will continue to have access to Google's services, such as Gmail, YouTube and Google maps.
<br><br>
The last week's order will curb the future transfer of hardware, software and services to Huawei.
<br><br>
Huawei's the world's second biggest smartphone manufacturer behind South Korea's Samsung.

Egypt's Interior Ministry says security forces killed 12 suspected militants during raids Monday near Cairo.
<br><br>
A ministry statement linked the militants to an armed affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood.  It said authorities found explosives, weapons and ammunitions at two different raid sites.
<br><br>
The operation came a day after a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near Egypt's Giza pyramids although the Interior Ministry did not link the two incidents.
<br><br>
Seventeen people were wounded in Sunday's attack and no one has claimed responsibility for that incident.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Sweden issued Monday a formal request to detain WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is currently jailed in Great Britain.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Charles De Ledesma reports.
<br><br>
A Swedish prosecutor says if the court decides to detain Assange on a probable cause suspected for rape, a European arrest warrant will be issued.
<br><br>
The development sets up a possible future tug-of-war between Sweden and the U.S. over any extradition of Assange from Britain.  In that eventuality, British authorities will have to decide any conflict between the European arrest warrant and the U.S. extradition request for Assange.

Television comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy took the oath of office Monday as the new president of Ukraine.
<br><br>
As expected, he immediately dissolved Ukraine's parliament and called for snap elections.  He also announced his main goal is to achieve a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine where government troops have been fighting with Russia-backed separatists for five years.
