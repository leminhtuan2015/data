  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Eoin, you said you are going to Osaka tomorrow night.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. I&#39;m catching a ferry leaving at 7 and I&#39;ll get in at 6:30 in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, you&#39;re taking the ferry?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Yep. That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. Why did you choose the ferry?

  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Because previously when I&#39;ve been up to Kansai, we caught a night bus, but it&#39;s not that comfortable on the night bus. You can&#39;t talk and difficult to go to the toilet even. On the ferry, there&#39;s a lot more space to move around. You can go to sleep when you want to. There&#39;s also a bath, so you can wash before arriving.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Actually, I took the ferry once to Osaka. I thought it was great. I preferred it. But you could have taken the train?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  I could have taken the train but
  <span class="audionotes">
   it costs considerably more
  </span>
  than the ferry so I went for the cheaper option.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. It is expensive. How much was the train to...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  The train to Osaka, I believe it was
  <span class="audionotes">
   somewhere in the region of
  </span>
  20,000 yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  On the shinkansen, which is the bullet train.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s round-trip or one-way?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  That was one-way I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, how much is the ferry?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  The ferry... with the internet booking discount that I got it cost 7,000 one-way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh,
  <span class="audionotes">
   that&#39;s not bad
  </span>
  . That&#39;s what it was when I went two years ago, about 7,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I think there&#39;s other ways of getting it cheaper. There&#39;s some kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   members card that you can enlist for
  </span>
  which is pretty cheap. Unfortunately, I&#39;m going to be pretty tight for time when I arrive at the ferry port so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to be able to sign up for it and get the extra discount or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right. Well, actually when I went, I guess the cheap ticket, you have to sleep in that big room, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The sleeping area. It makes you
  <span class="audionotes">
   feel like an immigrant
  </span>
  . You know, people coming to America or something for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I actually quite enjoy that in some ways,
  <br>
  It&#39;s more social than having your own cabin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  True. True.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  And I&#39;m going up there with my band so we spend a lot of time together. It&#39;s always nice to meet a few different people on the way up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
