   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hello Michael.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Hello Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  We&#39;re going to talk about Australia. Or your going to talk about Australia. So first of all how many people live in Australia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Australia? Oh, there&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   about
  </span>
  20 million people in Australia right now. A little bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   under
  </span>
  but
  <span class="audionotes">
   close to
  </span>
  twenty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What are the biggest cities?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  The biggest city? The biggest city is Sydney. Then it&#39;s followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it&#39;s Perth. Most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia.  Perth is on the west coast but sort of of out there by itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. If you had to live in one place where would you live?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  I like Brisbane. I had my teenage years in Brisbane, growing up in Brisbane. Maybe Sidney because it is a big city, but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice. Actually, what is the
  <span class="audionotes">
   capital
  </span>
  city of Australia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Ah, Canberra is the capital city but it&#39;s not the biggest city. Sydney is the biggest city. Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   get too crowded
  </span>
  . It&#39;s a separate territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Have you been to all the major cities in Australia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  I have been to Melbourne when I was young. Yeah, I have. Only a short time in Perth.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What is the best thing about Australia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  The best thing about Australia? Ah, probably the friendly people. The relaxed attitude and we like visitors from other cultures.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool. How are Australians different than other people? How are they unique?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  How are Australians unique? I would say that we&#39;re more
  <span class="audionotes">
   fun-loving maybe or accepting
  </span>
  of other people. We
  <span class="audionotes">
   don&#39;t mind
  </span>
  making new friends  actually and conversing with other people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s good. That&#39;s nice. OK. Thanks a lot Micheal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  No worries.
