   Todd:
  </strong>
  Lois, when are you going back to London, or England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m going back on the 30th of July.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, that&#39;s coming up pretty soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Just four more weeks. Four weeks from today, I&#39;ll be on the plane, on my way home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, when you go home, what are you going to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  In September I&#39;m going back to college because I want to be a primary school teacher in England, so I have to do a one year course to qualify and then hopefully I&#39;ll start teaching the next September back in England.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and what are you going to teach?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  So, I&#39;m teaching primary so that&#39;s all subjects. I&#39;m teaching science and English and math and maybe some French and sports and music and any other subjects they do at eight years old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, how old will the students be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  So I will be trained to teach from 5 to 11, and hopefully I will teach 7 or 8 year olds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mm, you like kids?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I hope so. Yeah, when I worked in Prague I taught some children&#39;s classes and I really, really enjoyed them, so hopefully I will like it in England as well. Although it will be a bit different because I&#39;ll have maybe twenty five or thirty students in a class so it might be slightly different to the twelve when I was in Prague.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a lot. What made you decide to become a teacher?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m not really sure because my mother was a teacher and she&#39;s trying really hard to convince me that I shouldn&#39;t do it because she thinks its too much work but I enjoy talking to people and being around children and teaching so hopefully it will be nice for me.
