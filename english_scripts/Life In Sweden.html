   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Ruth in Europe, have you traveled much?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually, um, well, when I was younger I went on a tour around all of Western Europe and then when I was at university I backpacked around Scandinavia for a month with a friend.
  <strong>
   (Nice!)
  </strong>
  It was really nice, actually, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, so where did you go in Scandinavia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Well, we started off in Sweden and then we went to Norway and then we went to Denmark. We never actually made it to Finland. That was simply because we ran out of money, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So were you out in the wilderness, or were you just going from village to village?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Really we just, we arrived in Stockholm. We went around Stockholm. We went to Oslo. We spent most of our time in the cities, although everything was so expensive. We ended up sleeping in youth hostels or on people&#39;s floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do you remember most about your trip?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Um, probably just having no money, so we couldn&#39;t eat really for a fortnight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You couldn&#39;t eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Well, we ate breakfast in the youth hostel, and then we would take a bread roll from the youth hostel, from the breakfast bar and have that for lunch and then in the evening we would eat if we could afford it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, in terms of food, what do people in Scandinavia usually eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Um, I think they eat a lot of potatoes and meat and things. I&#39;m not sure really what a typical Scandinavian meal would be.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s OK. You didn&#39;t have any money to buy any food right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  We didn&#39;t eat so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, silly question. Um, so what do you remember most about Stockholm?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Ah, they&#39;ve got some really nice buildings in Stockholm. I&#39;ve got relatives who live in Stockholm so we stayed with them, and also it was really hot when we went there, but it was also very pricey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So in every store you went into were they playing ABBA?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No. Thank goodness.
 </p>
