  : OK, Kawabe! Can you tell us about your English success story.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  English success story  It&#39;s not a success story but I can tell how I learned. OK, first of all, I don&#39;t think I learned English as a foreign, a foreign language because I loved to listen to music, especially rock n&#39; roll when I was a teenage. So when you love music, you become, like you, you want to sing with it so you memorize the whole lyrics and you know stuff and, so to me it was like, just, you know, a hobby, it was just a fun purely. It was the pure fun for me so, I didn&#39;t think I studied.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s great! So did you listen without reading the words, the lyrics, or did you just listen and read the lyrics at the same time?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Um, both! Both, yeah! Sometimes, I&#39;d see words which I don&#39;t understand, so I look up the dictionary and you know check the meaning and, you know, the things was always like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Um, so did you do anything else besides music?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Ah, what else? Yeah, the movie! The movie! Like, yeah, I loved to, one of my favorite movies, the Blues Brothers, because you know, that movie is interesting, and first of all, that funny, you know the funniest movie and like a great comedy in the history I think and that movie was famous for it&#39;s music, right, you know, that movie&#39;s soundtrack is great, and I have the CD in my room. And then..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You have it in your room?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  Yeah! I do and, so I saw that movie so many times. I don&#39;t remember how many times I saw that, and when you , you know, after the repetition, you know watching the same movies so many times you memorize a whole like words and sentence, what John Belushi was saying, what Dan Aykrod was saying, so it was a great study I think, for me!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s a great..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kawabe:
  </strong>
  But at that time I don&#39;t think that was studying you know!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was fun! So you enjoyed it!
