  Fred:
 </strong>
 What do you do in Christmas with gifts? You know, I&#39;m thinking about like how much money do you spend on gifts. When do you go shopping for them? Who do you give them to?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, you know Fred, I think it depends on the person, right? But usually in Switzerland people like to give gifts that have, like, some
  <span class="audionotes">
   personal meaning
  </span>
  , you know? It doesn&#39;t really matter how much they cost, you know, maybe if you buy a really expensive
  <span class="audionotes">
   present
  </span>
  , you feel a little bit like, &#34;Ah, this is too expensive,&#34; you know? So it&#39;s really nice to give maybe a picture in a frame or something like that. Mothers like that a lot.

  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think gifts to mothers are really important. So, how much money would you say you spend on your gifts
  <span class="audionotes">
   in general
  </span>
  for Christmas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s maybe like 200 Swiss Francs. It&#39;s maybe like a 100 US dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  100 US dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, but I really think it depends on the person, you know. But one thing that I really dislike about Christmas is the shopping, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  You dislike the shopping?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes. I love shopping, you know, but usually, but during Christmas I really don&#39;t like it because I always tell myself, I will start in November because no one will go shopping in November for Christmas presents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  But usually I
  <span class="audionotes">
   end up
  </span>
  going shopping on the 24th of December.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  The 24th of December! That&#39;s a bit late, isn&#39;t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  It is. That&#39;s why it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   such a hassle
  </span>
  . Yes, indeed. One thing that is interesting in Switzerland maybe is at one point you kind of, you don&#39;t receive presents anymore from your family members, like when you are a kid, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Really, your grandparents and your parents don&#39;t give you gifts anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yeah, not really, you know, because you start being a grown-up, you know, and you know, it costs a lot of money. They bought you so much during your childhood, so maybe when you turn 18, 19, 20, they&#39;re like, &#34;Ah, it&#39;s OK&#34; you know. You don&#39;t expect a present anymore. That&#39;s one thing in Switzerland.
