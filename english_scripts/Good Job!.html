  Todd:
 </strong>
 Talking about kids and school, what do you think about failure? Like it seems like we&#39;re moving to where we&#39;re not allowed to tell kids that they&#39;re not doing well, that everybody has to be a winner. You know, everybody gets a good grade. What do you think about that especially as a teacher and a parent?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  As a teacher, I think, I read something recently that the
  <span class="audionotes">
   chastising
  </span>
  a student, telling them they did bad, has no motivational value whatsoever but praise does. So definitely I think it&#39;s important to always praise. If you have a really bad student and you can&#39;t find anything to praise them on then I don&#39;t know what the answer is really. But I&#39;m sure you can always find something to praise someone on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  So I think it&#39;s important to focus on the positives all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  See actually I kind of disagree.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Do you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I think that, you know, that your score is or your progress is absolute. Like either you pass or you fail, either you get high marks or low marks but that&#39;s the motivation. Like if you get, if you don&#39;t do well, then you want to try harder. You know, like if you&#39;re a fat kid and you don&#39;t want to be fat then you, you know, you&#39;re motivated to lose weight or if you aren&#39;t a star in the baseball team you need to practice harder so you move up. But if you tell kids that they&#39;re doing great when actually they&#39;re not
  <span class="audionotes">
   exceptional
  </span>
  then maybe that actually does harm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  OK, well maybe I misexplained that. I don&#39;t mean give a false, I don&#39;t mean say they&#39;re doing well when they&#39;re not doing well but what I mean is focus more on the successes than the failures.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see. Like
  <span class="audionotes">
   confidence building
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess that&#39;s what I mean more. But I guess we&#39;re talking about motivation rather than an end result like, of course, yeah, you&#39;re going to fail some things. I don&#39;t know. I never failed that many things at school and later on in life when I did encounter failure, I
  <span class="audionotes">
   took it
  </span>
  pretty bad so perhaps it would have been healthier for me to have failed a few things. I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well that&#39;s the question, isn&#39;t it? Like when you fail or you do bad I think that maybe that&#39;s the
  <span class="audionotes">
   eye-opening
  </span>
  moment you need to see. Like you need to see the truth rather than just tell somebody that they&#39;re doing well when actually maybe they&#39;re not or that they&#39;re exceptional and talented when maybe they&#39;re not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  When they&#39;re not, that&#39;s true. Yeah, there was another thing that I read as well about telling, praising children for their intellgence, you should never, you should never tell a child they&#39;re smart because they get a false image of what intelligence is. You should always praise effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   As opposed to
  </span>
  some sort of innate, what we believe to be an innate quality that you can never have if you don&#39;t have it. So telling a child yeah you&#39;re really smart, when the child faces a problem that requires them to apply themselves and maybe fail they&#39;re afraid.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Because then they may think no I&#39;m not intelligent after all. So it should always be about praising effort and actually the result is not so important.
