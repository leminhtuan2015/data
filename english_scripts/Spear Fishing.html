   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Michael, you are into
  <span class="audionotes">
   spear fishing
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Yes, I enjoy going spear fishing
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Can you talk about that a bit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sure. Spear fishing basically is a sport that you dive under the water
  <span class="audionotes">
   with the aid of
  </span>
  flippers, wet suit and weights but you don&#39;t use oxygen at all. It&#39;s all-- you hyperventilate before you go down to get your oxygen levels up then you dive down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yeah,  then you have to you sometimes hide under rocks or actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   stalk
  </span>
  the fish and when you see a species that is edible and
  <span class="audionotes">
   of legal size
  </span>
  you can catch the fish
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, Wow. Now spear fishing, does that mean you throw the spear?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  No, you use spear guns which uses surgical rubber to propel the spear you just pull it down to cock it. It&#39;s kind of like a crossbow without the cross piece at the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So do you ever see sharks down there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you occasionally see sharks. It depends on where you are. You see a lot of.. there are some sharks called wobbegongs which are harmless sharks and they are actually quite friendly,  they won&#39;t attack you but if you&#39;ve caught some fish and you keep them on your purse and the blood goes into the water it can attract bigger sharks. And a few times when we&#39;ve been spear fishing, we&#39;ve actually had the sharks come down and take the fish while we&#39;re there and it&#39;s a little bit scary but the sharks themselves are.. they just sit there and watch you in the water. They&#39;re kind of like dogs, they&#39;re scary because they follow you and they look at you, and you turn around and they&#39;ll be sitting there looking at you. So most of the time we like to.. when we catch the fish, to keep the blood out of the water. We put them on a float that floats a
  <span class="audionotes">
   fair way away
  </span>
  from actually where you are fishing as a
  <span class="audionotes">
   safety precaution
  </span>
  but if you know..of course, you see too many sharks you just get out of the water...but now, it&#39;s nice and exciting.
