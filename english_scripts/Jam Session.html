   Todd:
  </strong>
  Shirley, we&#39;re talking about your singing career and you sing at weddings but you also sing just at normal events right like at clubs and places like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s right. Yeah, just at live venues and having either a concert or a jam session.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so what&#39;s the difference between just having just a concert or a jam session?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  As a singer you get a lot more control about what you would do and what kind of music you&#39;re going to do at a concert because that&#39;s really your chance to make you selection on the songs and the style of music and who you would play with and if you want to have a theme for the evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  At a jam session, that&#39;s a little bit different again. Usually just musicians come together and every thing&#39;s completely unrehearsed and people just literally just jam which means they get together and they
  <span class="audionotes">
   spontaneously
  </span>
  play and sing and ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So it sounds just like a party for musicians really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Usually the audience can get involved depending on the size of the venue. For example, a lot of places that I sing at are quite small jazz clubs so you&#39;re very close with the audience and they can ,you know, be clapping or just enjoying the spontaneity. There&#39;s usually a lot of energy in that kind of performance so I think that kind of leaks out into the audience and at the same time the audience bounces back that energy so it&#39;s almost like a conversation between the musicians and the audience and you get to
  <span class="audionotes">
   feed off
  </span>
  each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so you feed off the audience, their energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now when you preform do you get
  <span class="audionotes">
   stage fright
  </span>
  or do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   get butterflies
  </span>
  in your stomach?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Yeah, enormous butterflies. Actually more like huge cockroaches fluttering around in there I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yuck.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Sounds pretty terrible I know but, yeah, I&#39;m not an easy performer. It&#39;s kind of stressful for me before I get out there but once you get out there and you remember that the purpose for being there is to just give the audience a fun evening. Some relaxation, some time away from their everyday lives and that they&#39;re there to do that as well, so I find that a kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   reassuring
  </span>
  thought and I see it as my job to just give them a nice time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;ve heard you sing and you have an amazing voice. You&#39;re an incredible singer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Thank you.
 </p>
