   Shirley:
  </strong>
  David, so earlier, I was telling you I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Africa and I&#39;m just wondering, is that whole safari scene the
  <span class="audionotes">
   clich√©
  </span>
  ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   David:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not a cliche, but it&#39;s something real you have to experience when you get there on the safari. What you see on National Geographic and this ... you know .. documentaries is true. It&#39;s nothing ... it&#39;s not anything that ... they wouldn&#39;t show you that&#39;s not true that you&#39;ll find in Kenya.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Wow! So I could be just out there ... what driving around in my car and on my own just seeing all those animals?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   David:
  </strong>
  No, you don&#39;t get to drive in your own car. They provide services for you like ... we have like for instance in Kenya we have an institute called KWS: Kenya Wildlife Service that does that and it has its own warders that are highly trained to protect you when you&#39;re in the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  OK, so the tourists are kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   regulated
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   David:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sort of.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shirley: All right. So what could I expect to see if I go out?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   David:
  </strong>
  You can expect to see the wildlife itself: animals in their own habitat, some sleeping, some walking, some hunting. You never know. It depends on the time when you&#39;re doing your safari.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Am I gonna get chased by a rhinoceros?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   David:
  </strong>
  No, they actually don&#39;t chase you cause, you know, most of the time you&#39;re just passing by. You&#39;re not disturbing them, but at times you get into contact with animals. You know, animals live in
  <span class="audionotes">
   packs
  </span>
  , so when one animal is excommunicated from its pack, it&#39;s an angry animal. For instance, buffalo, so when you find one buffalo by itself, that&#39;s not a really nice thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  So, what would happen if I found a buffalo by itself?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   David:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s what we call a charged buffalo. It&#39;s really angry. It&#39;s been excommunicated from it&#39;s pack and it cannot join the other pack so it attacks at anything, you see, sometimes they are really dangerous and that&#39;s why you need the game warders who carry like ammunitions just to protect the tourists.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Wow! Really! So what&#39;s the chance of me getting attacked by a wild animal?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   David:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   One in a million
  </span>
  . But you never know. You can never
  <span class="audionotes">
   rule these things out
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  So it doesn&#39;t happen very often?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   David:
  </strong>
  It doesn&#39;t happen very often but at times in the past it&#39;s happened.
