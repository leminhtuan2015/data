   Nicola:
  </strong>
  So Kate, tell me about your favorite music!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  I&#39;d say my favorite music would have to be the Beatles.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>

   </a>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  I love the Beatles, cause they always make me happy and I&#39;ve grown up with the Beatles
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh, so you&#39;re parents listen to it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so we have all these old 45&#39;s when I was younger and this record player, and so we had loads of like
  <em>
   Simon and Garfunkel
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Beatles
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Stones
  </em>
  so that was the music I grew up listening to, and that&#39;s what I still really love.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Oh, awesome, and so do you like have a favorite song or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Yeah, probably it&#39;s
  <em>
   &#34;Happiness is a warm gun
  </em>
  &#34;
  <strong>
  </strong>
  which is on the
  <em>
   White Album
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Yeah, right, right, cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  I love all their albums. But I haven&#39;t been to Liverpool yet. I&#39;d like to go.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  That would be nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  And do you have a favorite Beatle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  John Lennon, definitely. He&#39;s definitely the coolest. I like his songs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Do you like his individual work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Some of them, like &#34;
  <em>
   Imagine
  </em>
  &#34; is really good. Yeah, he&#39;s definitely my favorite. Though, I quite like George as well. That was sad when he died, cause he was, yeah, he was real individual. I like Ringo, but Paul not so much.

   Michael:
  </strong>
  OK, so then. Hi! I&#39;m Michael. I&#39;m from Toronto.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Hi! I&#39;m Simon from Vancouver.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Simon!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  So, are you francophone?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;m not Francophone. That&#39;s a common mistake that other Canadians make. My parents were German so they use the German pronunciation of Simon, which is Simon
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Oh, really
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  OK, so the German and the French are.
  <strong>
   <br>
   .
  </strong>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Pretty similar. Ah, similar! Ah, yeah, Spanish, French, German. Pretty much only English has the Simon pronunciation of that, that name.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  OK, so you&#39;re from Vancouver.
  <strong>
   <br>
   <br>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from Toronto but some of my favorite music came from Vancouver. Ah, I&#39;m not quite sure, you look quite young, you may not have ever seen DOA play.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m very familiar with DOA. Actually, I&#39;m older than I look. I&#39;m 33, so I come from the DOA generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Excellent, so did you go to the Commodore Ballroom?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right, and I&#39;ve actually seen DOA at the Commodore and almost got hit in the head by a beer can that they throw out during their concerts. They like to throw beer cans into the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Well, I saw DOA at the university of Windsor where I went to do my undergraduate degree, and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. It was great.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah! I mean when I was in high school, they were already old, so but uh, they kept rocking&#39;.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  So how bout the, do you know, how long have you been in Japan? Do you go back and have you seen
  <br>
  any new bands in Vancouver.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Ah, well, I&#39;ve been in Japan just over a year so not that long. I did go back one time but we didn&#39;t see any concerts and the commodore has changed since those days of DOA.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  OK, just to show you how out of it I&#39;ve become, but I&#39;ve just recently discovered Nickel Back which is from Vancouver as well and also a band that I don&#39;t think die hard DOA fans would like cause it&#39;s pretty conventional rock I guess, but I like them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I don&#39;t. I mean, they&#39;ve got catchy tunes that many people like, for example my girlfriend who&#39;s Japanese loves Nickle Back, but I didn&#39;t even know they were from Vancouver. You know, they&#39;re just I thought there were from the Prairies or something like that. Yeah, there not cool enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  They&#39;re not cool enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  I think their music is crap.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Do you really?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s, I mean they sound the same as any number of bands, you know.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  OK, can you think of any group from Vancouver that is cool? A new band!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  A new band. Well, you&#39;ve caught me at a time because I&#39;m in Japan and so new music doesn&#39;t really resonate here. Is that the correct word to say?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Well, what&#39;s your definition of new then? Is it like a minute old?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  I can&#39;t say, you know, you stumped me on new music. Yeah, how bout you? Do you want to tell me about some music that you&#39;re listening to now?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Oh, you see, once you become middle-aged you start listening to a lot of stuff that you listened to when you were in high school or you actually find yourself nauseatingly wanting to hear things that you hated when you were in high school and it brings back memories, like I can actually say that I enjoy doing a lesson where I have to play ABBA for my students, whereas I hated it when I was a kid. When I was in high school if you put an ABBA record on I probably would have punched you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Oh, sure as and ESL teacher, we both have to play, you know, cheesy ballads and things like that for our students because that&#39;s what they like. Yeah. OK, let&#39;s get back to the music. You know, they&#39;re probably already old, yeah, if you want good solid Rock, I mean, the next best thing was The White Stripes a few years ago and their still quite good.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  And they&#39;re from Vancouver?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  No, they&#39;re from somewhere in the states. But they play, you know, really edgy sort of classical style rock for the modern age. I don&#39;t know, for the 2000, yeah.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m reading this book now about the so called Cam-Rock Renaissance, during the period 1985 to 1995. Bands like DOA of course, we&#39;ve already mentioned, also from Vancouver, Skinny Puppy, would probably.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Skinny puppy! There&#39;s a name I haven&#39;t heard in awhile.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Yep, and The Tragically Hip.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Overplayed group.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Overplayed! Tragically Hip is probably the most popular group in Canada, though.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I lived with a techno DJ in university, so we often had parties at our house and he would play his new stuff that he was very proud of, you know, acid jazz, hip-hop beats, and all kind of weird stuff, but good, and he had a rule because people kept on coming up to him and saying, &#34;Can you play &#39;The Hip&#39; man?&#34; and he always said, &#34;They&#39;ll be no &#39;Hip&#39; played at this house!&#34;
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  That sounds like something I did when I was DJing in bar. Everyone would ask me to play Guns n&#39; Roses and I absolutely despised them. I even went to the extent of buying one of the waitresses their album so that she would never request them again, but unfortunately I didn&#39;t have enough money to buy everyone the album and I found myself playing them sometimes two or three times, and the same song two or three times. It wasn&#39;t my place. I couldn&#39;t make the rule your friend made.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I could hear the recurring theme. Play GNR man!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Michael:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Well, let&#39;s wrap up that, this conversation.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Adrienne, let&#39;s talk about abilities. What are you good at?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Um, I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You don&#39;t know?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I really don&#39;t know!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I was looking at your photos, and you can play the violin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you can sing very well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Ah, I can sing some.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so, tell us about playing the violin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I really enjoy playing the violin. I&#39;ve been playing for many, many years since I was a little girl and everyone in my family plays an instrument so it&#39;s part of what we do together as a family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So when you were little you practiced every day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I did. My mom made me. I didn&#39;t have a choice. It&#39;s good for discipline though, or at least that&#39;s what she told me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, how would you practice? Did you have a tutor come over to your house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  No, I had a violin teacher once a week and when I was really small I went to group lessons also, so it was once a week with a private and once a week with a group.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s a lot. What did you think about the violin when you were little?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t remember thinking about it. I don&#39;t even remember learning how to play. I was only two so (so young) I know. I was still in diapers, but my mom said that when I had my first recital that I really wanted to play in the recital and she said I absolutely could not play on stage in a diaper so that&#39;s basically how she got me out of my diapers. So she says!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  When did you stop playing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I haven&#39;t stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, you still practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I still play although I don&#39;t have my violin here in Japan, right now. I&#39;m kind of on a break I guess. I just don&#39;t like to carry it around overseas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is it hard to be away from your violin?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  It is sometimes. I miss it. I miss playing with my family too, cause we&#39;re kind of like the Van Trap family, which you know from the movie
  <em>
   The Sound of Music
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, no, I don&#39;t. I&#39;ve never seen the movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, you haven&#39;t?
  <em>
   The Sound of Music
  </em>
  is about a family in, I think it&#39;s Austria and they all play an instrument or sing and it&#39;s a World War II movie and that&#39;s how they escape the Nazis, from singing or something. It&#39;s kind of like that, except for without the war.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I have to see the movie so!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you should.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So are you going to play the violin for me sometime?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Sure! If you can find a violin I will.
