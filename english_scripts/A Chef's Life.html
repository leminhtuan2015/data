   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Rebecca, now you were saying that were a chef, or you worked in a kitchen in your previous job. Can you talk about that? Like where did you work and what was it like?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  OK, I worked in a few different restaurants over several years, sometimes full-time, sometimes part-time. Sometimes I worked in busy city restaurants, and other times just small cafes doing breakfast, that kind of thing.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so, you must have had a very busy routine. Can you describe what&#39;s the typical workday when you are a chef?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Well, usually you start preparing in the afternoon and that&#39;s the quiet part of the day. You don&#39;t have any customers. You just come in and you chop up all the vegetables and the things you need to do like that. You cook any food that can be cooked before and organize all the
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    ingredients
   </span>
  </span>
  for the dishes. Then service starts at about six o&#39;clock and that&#39;s when it gets really crazy. It&#39;s really busy from then on and you have to be very organized and cook everything as fast as possible.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, sounds like a pretty busy schedule. When you&#39;re working, what do you enjoy about the job? What makes the job fun and interesting?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Actually, I like the
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    pressure
   </span>
  </span>
  of cooking. It&#39;s
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    stressful
   </span>
  </span>
  but it&#39;s also exciting. It&#39;s like a game. You have to organize everything, and you have to think of sixty things at once. It&#39;s a really good
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    atmosphere
   </span>
  </span>
  . Everybody&#39;s excited. Everyone has to work together. It&#39;s a team job, so you can make really close friends in the kitchen. It&#39;s fun to work with them.
 </p>

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is there anything you didn&#39;t like? Like maybe the smell of the food or getting dirty or things like that?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  No, that didn&#39;t bother me, but I used to travel home after work on the bus sometimes and
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    interestingly
   </span>
  </span>
  even when it was full I would have a seat to myself because the smell of the food gets into your clothes, your hair, your skin, everything. You smell like fifty different kinds of food. That&#39;s not a good thing.
 </p>

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. So did you have dogs or anything when you got home that they would be like craving for you to walk through the door?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  No, I didn&#39;t have dogs because I was scared they might eat me you know. They might think I was a piece of steak or something.
 </p>

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Alright thanks, Rebecca.
