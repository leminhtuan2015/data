   So, Eli, do you miss home?

    Eli:
   </strong>
   I&#39;m missing home a lot actually, at the moment. I wasn&#39;t when I first arrived, because of all the excitement about being here, and everything, but since actually about a month and a half ago, my boyfriend came here for three weeks, three and a half weeks, and we went traveling around the rest of Japan, which I think is very important, if you&#39;re here, you got to do it and he was the perfect person to do it and we had loads and loads of fun, and since he&#39;s left, yeah, I&#39;ve started to think about home a bit more, now living here is kind of just normal way of life and after the big excitement of having him here, you know traveling around everywhere, it&#39;s, I&#39;m starting to think about him, my family, my friends and just you know when I ring him up they&#39;re all doing stuff that we used to do together, and it sort of makes you think about what it would be like to get home. I think I&#39;m quite looking forward to going home now.

    Eli:

   We actually met in a club which he runs. He has two jobs. He runs a club in Bristol and he edits magazines for recycling in Bristol and Wales and writes articles about environmental recycling issues. Actually when he came to Japan, he managed to interview a few people here about it, and Japanese recycling isn&#39;t as strict as you think it is, um, yeah, but we met in his club and he is a friend of my brothers and we knew a lot of the same people, but it&#39;s cheesy to say but almost it was love at first site. I t took about half a year for us to get together, but we were sort of good friends before that and we&#39;ve been together for two and a half years now. (That&#39;s a long time.) It&#39;s not really though. It&#39;s just zoomed by so quickly. Yeah, we live together now in England and sort of very happy. We never, we&#39;re one of these couples that never argue. We obviously have disagreements but there&#39;s never any sort of shouting involved. We like a lot of the same things. We like lots of different things as well. I think it&#39;s very important. You can&#39;t only be into the same things. I&#39;m slowly turning his mind towards anime and computer games. I&#39;m twisting, twisting him, but I do have to make it clear when any Final Fantasy games are out, that I have two boyfriends and he is only one of them.
