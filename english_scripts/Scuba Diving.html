   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nicola, you were talking to us the other day that you
  <span class="audionotes">
   went diving
  </span>
  in Australia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right I did.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, so what was it like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Well, actually it was quite scary to be honest. When I first started I did an
  <span class="audionotes">
   introductory course
  </span>
  which was just maybe like two days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  And so they just sent you out with all of the equipment, put you in the sea and guided you, but then when I did the real course we started in the swimming pool which was fine and it was all great fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although, there were two men on my course who completely
  <span class="audionotes">
   freaked out
  </span>
  and had to leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so that was fine but then they took us out to sea which was a bit different. Yeah,  they made us set up our own equipment, I mean they still checked us and everything so we didn&#39;t die but we had to put on our own equipment. We had a diving buddy who I was with and I was with my friend Graham, who I was traveling with anyway and we went down into the sea. We went down maybe fifteen meters. And they always say like &#39;Don&#39;t
  <span class="audiodef">
   Panic
  </span>
  &#39; just keep breathing normally and everything. But I did kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   panic
  </span>
  a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, no!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  So then I
  <span class="audionotes">
   rose to the surface
  </span>
  really quickly which you know, you&#39;re not
  <span class="audionotes">
   supposed to
  </span>
  do in diving. So I went up really quickly. Luckily we weren&#39;t deep enough to do any damage but my diving buddy Graham was having a great time down there looking at shipwrecks and didn&#39;t even notice that I was missing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What a terrible guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I know. so, then...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! Did they fail him? I hope he failed the course?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  No, he passed. He paid enough money. He passed. But it meant that I couldn&#39;t go diving for the rest of the day cause I had gone down quite deep so that was a
  <span class="audionotes">
   shame
  </span>
  , but..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s terrible. But you didn&#39;t hurt yourself, you didn&#39;t come up too fast?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  No, I was fine in the end but it was a shame because that was the end of my diving day. But we had a few more days to do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So now you are comfortable diving. You don&#39;t freak out anymore?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t freak out anymore but I couldn&#39;t go diving now on my own because it has been so long. Yeah.
 </p>
