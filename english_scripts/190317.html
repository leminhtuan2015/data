The death toll in Friday's deadly mass massacres in New Zealand has now risen to 50 even as the first funerals for some of the victims were held on Saturday.
<br><br>
Canterbury Police Commissioner Mike Bush said the latest victim was discovered when police were recovering bodies from the mosques.  Bush also said the number of injured has risen to 50 with two in critical condition
<br><br>
"... 36 of those remain in Christchurch Hospital, where they are being treated with the utmost care and professionalism by medical staff.  Two do remain critical and we also have one child being well looked after at Starship Hospital in Christchurch."
<br><br>
The main suspect has been identified as 28-year-old Australian white supremacist Brenton Harrison Tarrant.  He was remanded without plea on one charge of murder until his next court appearance on April 5.

Violent clashed erupted between police and yellow vest protesters in Paris on Saturday, the 18th week of the demonstrations.
<br><br>
Windows in some of the shops along the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es were smashed while vehicles and at least one bank branch were set on fire.  The awning of Paris's famous Fouquet's brasserie, a symbol of wealth and privilege to many, were set on fire.
<br><br>
Police fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse the protesters.
<br><br>
Officials say that more than 200 people were arrested.  They say that 42 protesters, 17 police officers and one firefighter were injured in the clashes.
<br><br>
The yellow vest movement started in opposition to a planned fuel tax rise but has since developed into a broader revolt against the government and President Emmanuel Macron

A U.S. Navy veteran from California has been sentenced to 10 years in prison in Iran.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports.
<br><br>
A lawyer for Michael R. White says the former Navy cook was convicted of insulting Iran's supreme leader and posting private information online.
<br><br>
White's mother had said her son went to Iran to see a woman she described as his girlfriend though his lawyer says White appears to have made the trip without informing the woman.
<br><br>
His arrest was first reported in October.  White is the first American Iran is known to have detained since President Trump took office.  Three other Americans are known to be held there.
<br><br>
Trump has taken a hardline approach to Iran going out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid&oacute; was in the city of Valencia in northern Venezuela Saturday to begin a tour of the country as part of his efforts to oust embattled President Nichol&aacute;s Maduro.
<br><br>
Guaid&oacute; tweeted photos of the day's activities, attended a service at Valencia Cathedral and visited a local market greeting crowds of supporters.
<br><br>
He told supporters that the Maduro presidency has lost its legitimacy.
<br><br>
He said that he, meaning President Maduro, thinks that a stolen sash and a palace makes one a president.  "No, sir.  It's the support of the people that makes a president.  He doesn't have this."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Venezuelans marched through the capital, Caracas, on Saturday to show support for Nichol&aacute;s Maduro.
<br><br>
The United States and dozens of other nations have recognized Guaid&oacute; as Venezuela's legitimate leader.  However, Russia, China and several other countries are still siding with Maduro.
<br><br>

France's air accident investigation agency says data from the cockpit voice recorder on an Ethiopian Airlines jet that crashed last Sunday has been successfully downloaded.
<br><br>
However, as Reuters correspondent Anna Bevan reports, the airlines says identifying the remains of those killed could take months.
<br><br>
Ethiopian Airlines said Saturday that DNA testing on the remains of the 157 passengers killed on board flight 302 may take up to six months
<br><br>
A team of investigators in Paris has begun examining the black box recorders recovered from the site where the Boeing 737 MAX8 plane crashed last week shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.
<br><br>
The U.S. plane maker had been working on a software upgrade for anti-stall system and pilot displays in the wake of a deadly airliner crash in Indonesia in October, which killed 189 people.
<br><br>
Similarities between the Lion Air and the Ethiopian Airline(s) crashes have raised fresh questions about the system.  But so far, there is no evidence that suggests that the software was to blame for either incident.
