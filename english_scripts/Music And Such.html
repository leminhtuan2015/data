   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Matt, we&#39;re back. We&#39;re gonna talk about music. What is your favorite kind of music?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  My favorite kind of music is
  <span class="audionotes">
   alternative music
  </span>
  . Generally, I like all types of music
  <span class="audionotes">
   apart from
  </span>
  country music.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m the same way. I hate country except for Johny Cash.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Yeah. The older country is good but the newer, I don&#39;t like the newer stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. How expensive are CDs in your country?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Well, a brand new CD is probably between about 15 and 20 dollars. Yeah, but you can find used CDs from anything to a dollar to.. you know, 20 dollars I guess,  depending on the CD. So you can find cheap CDs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s pretty cheap. Do you play a musical instrument?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t. Although, when I was a kid I played the piano and a little bit of the guitar but I&#39;ve
  <span class="audionotes">
   long since forgotten
  </span>
  all of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Usually, you pick up the guitar and you don&#39;t
  <br>
  stop playing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  There was no talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you go to concerts?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  I go. I really enjoy going to concerts but I like to go to small venues. Small shows. I don&#39;t like those big stadium shows where you need binoculars just to see the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I agree. And the last question, most importantly, do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   sing in the shower
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Of course I do. Yeah, every chance I get.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, what kind of songs do you sing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow! I guess anything that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   in my head
  </span>
  , the last thing I heard I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Can you sing something right now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so. This isn&#39;t a shower.
