   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Steven, what do you want to talk about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Hiking!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hiking! Are you a
  <span class="audiodef">
   big
  </span>
  mountain man?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, I really love getting out into the mountains.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What mountains have you climbed?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, recently, I climbed Mt. Fuji.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, how long did it take you to get to the top?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, I actually climbed Mt. Fuji on four different occasions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so it was different times each trek.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, did you go in summer or in spring?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  No, actually, the first time I went in, to climb Fuji was in the winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, man that must have been cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, it wasn&#39;t too bad. We had warm clothes and, you know, we were
  <span class="audiodef">
   constantly
  </span>
  walking, so our body temperature was quite high.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Didn&#39;t you
  <span class="audiodef">
   slip
  </span>
  on the ice? Wasn&#39;t the ice really slippery?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, we had crampons and ice axes with us.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really, I&#39;m sorry, you had &#34;crampons&#34;?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah, they&#39;re like spikes that go on your feet, yeah, basically ice shoes, yeah, so you can actually walk on the ice with these shoes without slipping, no problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really! What was it like on the top?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, on that
  <span class="audiodef">
   particular
  </span>
  occasion we didn&#39;t get to the top because it was too late in the day. We would have arrived at the top just as the just was setting and it would have been very dangerous I think coming back down, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Because it would have been dark?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Wow, well, really
  <span class="audiodef">
   impressive
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I really loved it.
