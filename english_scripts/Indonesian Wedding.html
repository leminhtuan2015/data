 <strong>
  Sunny
 </strong>
 : So, Isthma, can you tell me about the wedding ceremonies in Indonesia?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : The wedding ceremonies in Indonesia are pretty large, but it depends on the family as well, and the couple. We usually have it in halls, but also, some people have it in mosques, where they usually do the officials, the first stage first. And usually, it doesn&#39;t cost a lot of money, I think, because you already have the hallways and the mosques. Or usually, people have it in their homes, so it&#39;s very convenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : So, what age is like the average age for getting married?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : The average age for getting married for a woman is probably around 24 until 27, and for guys, for men, it&#39;s usually 27 until 30,
  <span class="audionotes">
   early 30s
  </span>
  , yeah. So, pretty young, I guess, compared to other countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : Who pays for the wedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : I think both sides pay for the wedding, but I think the groom would pay a higher percentage of it. It also depends on their
  <span class="audionotes">
   compromise
  </span>
  . I think they have the compromise of, or decide like which they have to pay or, you know, the
  <span class="audionotes">
   girl&#39;s side
  </span>
  have to pay. So, I think it would be their own decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : And how about the typical gifts you get from a wedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : The typical gifts would be money. We usually have a big box at the reception, before you come in, and it would be in envelopes, of course. That&#39;s usually it, yeah. But from the groom, maybe they do provide, like they give beds or, as you said, refrigerator or any other households.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : How about the women? Usually, do women work when they get married, or are they usually housewives?
 </p>
 <p>
  I
  <strong>
   sthma
  </strong>
  : Again, it depends on the couple. But usually, women are housewives, because they have to take care of their husband, and they have to be at home when their husband comes home. Usually, after a few years, if they do have a child, of course, the wife would have to stay home and take care of the child or the baby.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : How about the divorce rate? Is divorce common?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : Divorces are uncommon in Indonesia, just because the
  <span class="audionotes">
   majority
  </span>
  of Indonesians are Muslims, and we don&#39;t - it&#39;s frowned upon in Indonesia. So I think that&#39;s another reason why the percentage is really low for divorces, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : Is there anything unique about the Indonesia wedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : I think one unique thing - well, I think there are a lot of unique things in Indonesia; I think for every culture - we have our own
  <span class="audionotes">
   traditional clothes
  </span>
  that we have to wear. So every culture in every island maybe they have like their own special clothes that they need to wear, and it&#39;s very different from each island, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : Okay, thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : Thank you.
