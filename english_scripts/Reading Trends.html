  Todd:
 </strong>
 Actually I still enjoy newspapers somewhat. I like to eat my lunch and read the newspaper or maybe have a newspaper when I’m taking the bus or the train, so I have something to read, but I don’t buy them
 <span class="audionotes">
  as much as I used to
 </span>
 .
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that’s true, I really like the idea of having a newspaper in paper form and I do enjoy opening it up and having a coffee in the morning and reading the newspaper, but I don’t actually do that now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how often do you actually start and finish a book?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Well, I’ve been reading maybe one or two books a week, recently which is quite a lot for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that’s pretty good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  As I said earlier, it’s really because I have a bit more spare time than I used to so that has changed my reading habits. And when I’m traveling I love reading, so if I’m on a train I love reading a book and if I’m on a plane I prefer to read a book than watch a movie, for example, so
  <span class="audionotes">
   I get a lot of enjoyment out of
  </span>
  reading books, still.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having said that
  <span class="audionotes">
   I do listen
  </span>
  to e-books on the computer...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I love e-books.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  ...which I love because it’s very
  <span class="audionotes">
   therapeutic
  </span>
  I think listening to someone reading to you, a bit like when you were little and your mom used to read you a book. I like to do that when I’m really tired and I don’t want to actually physically read a book and I don’t want to even check my e-mail. I just want to lie down and basically listen to a story. Yeah, so I have enjoyed doing that recently and technology has had
  <span class="audionotes">
   a big part to play
  </span>
  in how much I do that.
