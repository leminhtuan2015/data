   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Jessica, we&#39;re back. We&#39;re gonna talk about your future. What do you want to be when you
  <span class="audionotes">
   grow up
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Well,  I want to be a
  <span class="audiodef">
   physician&#39;s assistant
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What is a
  <span class="audionotes">
   physician&#39;s assistant
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Well, normally when you go into  the doctor&#39;s office, you wouldn&#39;t usually get-- well you would get your doctor all they do is check, give you
  <span class="audionotes">
   check-ups
  </span>
  or you know maybe
  <span class="audionotes">
   take out
  </span>
  <span class="audiodef">
   stitches
  </span>
  or something, not surgery.
 </p>
 <p>
  You just go in and do the little things. So the doctor does not have to do them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. So that is what you want to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  And make lots of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You want to make lots of money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  OK. Nothing wrong with that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How do you become a  physician&#39;s assistant. I can&#39;t even say it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a lot of schooling. You have like six years, four or six years of college and you obviously take like nursing and other kinds of classes like that, and then you do like  two or four years at like a hospital as a..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like an assistant, or..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Like you&#39;re actually doing the work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, an
  <span class="audiodef">
   intern
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  An
  <span class="audionotes">
   intern
  </span>
  , yeah! An internship for two or four years at a hospital.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Then, that&#39;s it. You finish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  And then you hopefully go on and maybe have your own little doctor&#39;s place and open that up or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, best wishes on becoming a physician&#39;s assistant. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll make a good one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Thank you.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Christian, what is your dream job, if you could have any job in the world?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  My dream job is to become a diplomat
  <span class="audiodef">
   representing
  </span>
  my country, preferably in Japan. That&#39;s why I came to Japan to learn Japanese and hopefully obtain a master degree in International Relations. After getting my master&#39;s degree in International Relations, I would like to go home and enter the diplomat school for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is a three year program, and then, after that hopefully come back to Japan and work for the Norwegian Embassy in Tokyo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Must be pretty competitive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s very competitive, but I think if you know a certain language that not many people speak it gives you a
  <span class="audiodef">
   competitive edge
  </span>
  nevertheless so that&#39;s why I came to Japan because I know at this stage there are only 300 hundred people from Norway living in Japan and not all of them are here to study Japanese, they represent different companies or schools, or they&#39;re
  <span class="audiodef">
   missionaries
  </span>
  so, that&#39;s the track I&#39;m on right now but we&#39;ll see how it goes in the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How about when you were a child, what was your dream job? Did you want to be a diplomat when you were say, 10?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  No, when I was ten I probably didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do. I was just too busy playing in the street, you know, having fun with my friends and these things. When I was that young I really didn&#39;t have a dream job like fireman, police. I never really went
  <span class="audiodef">
   through that stage
  </span>
  , you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I wanted to be a baseball player.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  Alright,
  <span class="audiodef">
   fair enough
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m still dreaming.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s good.
