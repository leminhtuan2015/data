   Todd:
  </strong>
  Alex, can you talk a little about working at a radio station?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sure. The Radio station at my school is called WMKP. I&#39;m actually a DJ. Well, not the turn table DJ per se, but a DJ that just plays music and talks on the air a lot, so I do that a lot and that&#39;s really fun because I can have guests over and I can play, I like all kinds of music, and where I am only people listen to certain types, so I like to sort of open their ears to many different kinds of music from, I don&#39;t know, electronic, to classical, to jazz, to whatever I feel like playing.

  And it&#39;s really a bunch of fun. You make a whole lot of friends and you meet bands too because we have, we hold concerts sometimes so, you know, maybe I&#39;m working at the radio station. I&#39;m part of the staff at the concerts and I meet a lot of bands. It&#39;s really a very, very, very, very, very fun.
