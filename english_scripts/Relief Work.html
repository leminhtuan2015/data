   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, I am here with Tarta and we are talking about the &#34;tsunami&#34; in Thailand and she helped people after the event. Can you talk about what it was like the few days after the &#34;tsunami&#34; hit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  Yes, right away from like from the &#34;tsunami&#34; hit, I went on the 28th, so two days after &#34;tsunami&#34; hit, so everything is like damaged and, you know all waters are all over the place. There&#39;s car on top of the buildings too, like the second floor of the buildings and rotten bodies like everywhere ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow, dead bodies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  Dead bodies like really everywhere, and because that time there were not many volunteers yet ... so if we just walk through the place that we just want to find a live person to give a food or to help but then we just hit by the dead body, like without knowing because it is a huge body and you can&#39;t recognize who is that person because, you know, all the faces are just getting, I just don&#39;t want to say it but ... but it really was ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you actually helped?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  I helped because I was there so early for two days and then I helped to the volunteer who helped to
  <span class="audionotes">
   picking up
  </span>
  the dead body so I ... whenever I find a dead body so I called the person and then we helped to pick up the dead body into the
  <span class="audionotes">
   pick-up car
  </span>
  and then send it to the temple. To ... for, what do you call the ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The identification?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  Yeah, identification at the temple. So, because they have some base over there and
  <span class="audionotes">
   carry on
  </span>
  for almost a week so there are probably, like, 50 organizations who come and help us.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So after this
  <span class="audionotes">
   horrific
  </span>
  event happened, how did it change you? Like, did it give you a different perspective about life or about nature or ... anything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tarta:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I do agree. I think, I mean, nature always have a, what do you call, always fair you know? If you do ... everything have
  <span class="audionotes">
   cause and effect
  </span>
  . So if you do something it is going to give you a return in somehow, in someway, like whenever it&#39;s going to happen. So, I believe in &#34;karma&#34; too, so I think it&#39;s a good example that what humans do to the nature and nature give you back.
