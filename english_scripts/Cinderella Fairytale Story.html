       NCE UPON A TIME
      </span>
     </strong>
     a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire.  It was she who cooked the meals. It was she who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “What a mess!” her two stepsisters laughed.  And that is why they called her “Cinderella.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     One day, big news came to town.  The King and Queen were going to have a ball!  It was time for the Prince to find a bride. All of the young ladies in the land were invited to come.  They were wild with joy! They would wear their most beautiful gown and fix their hair extra nice. Maybe the prince would like them!

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     At Cinderella’s house, she now had extra work to do.  She had to make two brand-new gowns for her step-sisters.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Faster!” shouted one step-sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “You call that a dress?” screamed the other.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Oh, dear!” said Cinderella.  “When can I–“
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The stepmother marched into the room.  “When can you WHAT?”
    </span>
    <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-190" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad">
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Well,” said the girl, “when will I have time to make my own dress for the ball?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “You?” yelled the stepmother.  “Who said YOU were going to the ball?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “What a laugh!” said one step-sister.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Such a mess!” They pointed at Cinderella.  All of them laughed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Cinderella said to herself, “When they look at me, maybe they see a mess.  But I am not that way.  And if I could, I WOULD go to the ball.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Soon the time came for the stepmother and step-sisters to leave for the big party.  Their fine carriage came to the door. The stepmother and step-sisters hopped inside.  And they were off.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Good-bye!” called Cinderella.  “Have a good time!” But her stepmother and step-sisters did not turn around to see her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Ah, me!” said Cinderella sadly.  The carriage rode down the street.  She said aloud, “I wish I could go to the ball, too!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Then - Poof!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     All of a sudden, in front of her was a fairy.
    </span>

     “You called?” said the fairy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Did I?” said Cinderella.  “Who are you?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Why, your Fairy Godmother, of course!  I know your wish.  And I have come to grant it.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “But…” said Cinderella, “my wish is impossible.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Excuse me!” said the Fairy Godmother in a huff.  “Did I not just show up out of thin air?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Yes, you did,” said Cinderella.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Then let me be the one to say what is possible or not!”

    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Well, I think you know I want to go to the ball, too.” She looked down at her dirty clothes.  “But look at me.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “You do look a bit of a mess, child,” said the Fairy Godmother.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Even if I had something nice to wear,&#34; said the girl, &#34;I would have no way to get there.&#34;
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Dear me, all of that is possible,” said the Fairy. With that, she tapped her wand on Cinderella’s head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     At once, Cinderella was all clean.  She was dressed in a beautiful blue gown.  Her hair was set up high on her head inside a golden band.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">

   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Who said I was done?” said the Fairy Godmother.  She tapped her wand again. At once, a beautiful carriage came to be, with a driver and four white horses.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Am I dreaming?” said Cinderella, looking around her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “It is as real, as real can be,” said the Fairy Godmother.  “But there is one thing you must know.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “What is that?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “All of this lasts only to midnight.  Tonight, at the stroke of midnight, it will all be over.  Everything will go back to how it was before.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Then I must be sure to leave the ball before midnight!” said Cinderella.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Good idea,” said the Fairy Godmother.  She stepped back. “My work is done.” And with that, the Fairy Godmother was gone.

   <p>
    <span style="font-size: 20px; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">
     Cinderella looked around her.  &#34;Did that even happen?&#34;  But there she stood in a fine gown, and with a golden band in her hair.  And there were her driver and four horses before her, waiting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Coming?” called the driver.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     She stepped into the carriage.  And they were off.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Over at the ball, the Prince did not know what to think.  “Why do you have that sad look on your face?” the Queen said to her son.  “Look around you! You could not ask for finer maidens than these.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “I know, Mother,” said the Prince.  Yet he knew something was wrong. He had met many of the young women.  Yet after he said “hello,” one by one, he could find nothing more to say.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     &#34;Look!&#34;  Someone pointed to the front door.  “Who is that?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     All heads turned.  Who was that lovely maiden stepping down the stairs?  She held her head tall and looked as if she belonged. But no one knew her.

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Have we met?” said the Prince.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “I am pleased to meet you now,” said Cinderella with a bow.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The Prince felt a leap in his heart.  He and Cinderella danced. When the song was over, they danced again.  And then they danced again, and yet again. Soon the other maidens at the ball grew jealous.  “Why is he dancing all the time with her?” they said. “How rude!”
    </span>

    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">

     “But we just met!” said the Prince.  “Why leave now?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Dong!” rung the clock.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “I must GO!” said Cinderella.  She ran to the steps.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Dong!” said the clock.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “I cannot hear you,” said the Prince.  “The clock is too loud!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Dong!” rung the clock.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Goodbye!” said Cinderella. Up, up the stairs she ran.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Dong!” went the clock.

   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Oh, dear!” she said as one glass slipper fell off her foot on the stair.  But Cinderella kept running up.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Dong!” said the clock.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Please wait a moment!” said the Prince.

    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Dong!” rung the clock.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Goodbye!” Cinderella turned one last time.  Then she rushed out the door.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Dong!”  The clock was quiet. It was midnight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Wait!” called the Prince.  He picked up her glass slipper and rushed out the door.  He looked around but could not see her blue dress anywhere.  “This is all I have left from her,” he said, looking down at the glass slipper.  He saw that it was made in a special way, to fit a foot like none other. “Somewhere there is the other glass slipper,” he said.  “And when I find it, I will find her, too.  Then I will ask her to be my bride!”

    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     From hut to hut, from house to house, went the Prince.  One young woman after another tried to fit her foot inside the glass slipper.  But none could fit. And so the Prince moved on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     At last the Prince came to Cinderella’s house.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “He is coming!” called one step-sister as she looked out the window.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “At the door!” screamed the other step-sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Quick!” yelled the stepmother.  “Get ready! One of you must be the one to fit your foot in that slipper.  No matter what!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The Prince knocked.  The stepmother flew open the door.  “Come in!” she said. “I have two lovely daughters for you to see.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The first step-sister tried to place her foot in the glass slipper.  She tried hard, but it just would not fit. Then the second step-sister tried to fit her foot inside.  She tried and tried with all her might, too. But no dice.
    </span>

    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Are there no other young women in the house?” said the Prince.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “None,” said the stepmother.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Then I must go,” said the Prince.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Maybe there is one more,” said Cinderella, stepping into the room.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “I thought you said there were no other young women here,” said the Prince.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “None who matter!” said the stepmother in a hiss.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Come here,” said the Prince.

   <p style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Cinderella stepped up to him.  The Prince got down on one knee and tried the glass slipper on her foot.  It fit perfectly! Then, from her pocket Cinderella took out something. It was the other glass slipper!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “I knew it!” he cried.  “You are the one!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “WHAT?” shouted a step-sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Not HER!” screamed the other step-sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “This cannot BE!” yelled the stepmother.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     But it was too late.  The prince knew that Cinderella was the one.  He looked into her eyes. He did not see the cinders in her hair or the ashes on her face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “I have found you!” he said.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “And I have found you,” said Cinderella.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     And so Cinderella and the Prince were married, and they lived happily ever after.
