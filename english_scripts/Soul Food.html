  Mike
 </strong>
 : So Dusty-
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Uh-huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Tell me a little about - you&#39;re from Philadelphia, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Tell me a little bit about - soul food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Okay. So
  <span class="audionotes">
   soul food
  </span>
  - actually, it comes from the South, and Philadelphia has a lot of great soul food restaurants. What soul food is, most of it comes from back in
  <span class="audionotes">
   slave days
  </span>
  , you know. Slaves, they can&#39;t get the really good cuts of the meat or the good parts. They got the kind of leftovers or the thrown away stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : They had to learn how to make it into something a bit better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : So it&#39;s just kind of good,
  <span class="audionotes">
   hearty
  </span>
  eating. Most of it is cooked - it&#39;s not really the healthiest food - a lot of it is cooked in butter, or fried up in lard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Right. So can you give me some examples of like some soul food dishes maybe, and what&#39;s inside it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : So, of course, the classic ones are things like fried chicken or chitlin. And chitlin is basically like stewed pig intestines of seasoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s tasty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s not something I like, but some people enjoy it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : And then, there&#39;s also things like collard greens, yams, mashed potatoes - a lot of things you see all the time - biscuits. These are all things that are like soul food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Just curious, does it differ by region? Like for example, you&#39;re from Philadelphia, which is further north. Do you get different types of soul food if you go like further towards the south, like the Cajun parts, let&#39;s say Louisiana or something?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Well, Cajun food&#39;s a bit different, but as you travel down south, you start seeing differences. Like where I was from in the States, we almost never had chitlins in the north, because it was just something that wasn&#39;t very
  <span class="audionotes">
   appetizing
  </span>
  . Or chicken feet is another one, pig&#39;s feet - food like that just wasn&#39;t as popular. But as you go down south, you get back to the roots of it more, and so you start finding more restaurants that sell these kinds of things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I still can&#39;t eat it. It&#39;s horrible, but--
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Interesting. So is there a particular favorite kind of soul food dish that you like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Oh, I still love collard greens. One of the things that when I was younger, I didn&#39;t like them so much; as I got older, I enjoyed them. It&#39;s almost like a kind of spinach basically.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : But it&#39;s kind of a bit more
  <span class="audionotes">
   flavored and spicier
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dusty
  </strong>
  : Yeah. And macaroni and cheese I love, of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow! Right on.
