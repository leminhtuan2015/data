U.S. President Donald Trump has backed down on his threat of military retaliation for Iran.  But AP's Ben Thomas reports the situation is still tense.
<br><br>
"Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness."
<br><br>
That was National Security Advisor John Bolton speaking at Israel Sunday alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
<br><br>
While President Trump called off airstrikes last week that he says Bolton was advocating, U.S. officials say he simultaneously gave the U.S. military a go-ahead for cyber attacks, targeting Iranian military computer systems that control its rocket and missile launchers.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Bolton says the economic pressure will continue.  "We expect that the new sanctions President Trump referred to in preparation for some weeks will be announced publicly on Monday.  Stay tuned."

[Former British Foreign Minister] Former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is promising to deliver Brexit in his first formal pitch to the party members in Birmingham in central England.
<br><br>
Opening his address, he said, "We need to get Brexit done and to be prepared to leave the EU without a withdrawal deal in place."
<br><br>
"That will keep somebody with the determination and the courage and the application to get Brexit over the line to relaunch our party and then to take the fight to the socialists.  That's what people want."
<br><br>
Johnson's opponent is the current foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and he says he is prepared to do the same thing but in a right way.
<br><br>
"... we must keep our promise to the British people.  But I would do so with a heavy heart, because of the risks to businesses up and down the country and the risks to the union."
<br><br>
Johnson is the favorite of [Toy] Tory lawmakers to take the party leadership replacing Theresa May as prime minister.

The ruling party candidate in the rerun of Istanbul's mayoral election has conceded defeat to opposition candidate Ekrem &Iacute;mamo&#287;lu.
<br><br>
Sunday's vote was held because election authorities annulled &Iacute;mamo&#287;lu's [inu...] initial historic election victory in March on a technicality after President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an [defeated the defeat] disputed the defeat of his candidate.
<br><br>
Electoral authorities rejected the ruling party's claims of voting fraud but ordered a revote after ruling a number of election officials were ineligible.
<br><br>
In a sign of the importance of Sunday's election, voting was brisk from the moment the polls opened.
<br><br>
Istanbul is Erdo&#287;an's home city and has been his power base for 25 years since his rise to power started as the city's mayor.  The city accounts for third Turkey's economy and nearly half the taxation.  The mayorship is widely seen as Turkey's most important political prize after the presidency.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday he wants to give opposition Democratic lawmakers "every last chance" to stiffen the country's asylum laws and immigration policies before launching nationwide raids to deport undocumented migrants.
