  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Julia, now you are a parent.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And have you heard of all these terms that we have in the US for different types of parents? I wonder if you have them in the UK?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You mean like soccer mum, stuff like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve heard of actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So what do you think a soccer mom is? What have you heard?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  My image is a mother who dedicates her time to running her kids to and from soccer practice. Is that right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  And also drives a big vehicle? My image is of a big SUV or a big four wheel drive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. I think it&#39;s also, it&#39;s like a parent that has many scheduled events for their child.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So maybe they have swimming class or soccer practice, ballet and stuff like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Oh, maybe I&#39;m a little bit of a soccer mum.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think now, yeah. I think it&#39;s actually a good term. It&#39;s like, I think a soccer mom usually is considered a caring parent.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And they try to have their child doing
  <span class="audionotes">
   productive
  </span>
  things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  It must be pretty, quite an
  <span class="audionotes">
   affluent
  </span>
  perhaps middle class kind of parent.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, exactly, exactly. Now we have the
  <span class="audionotes">
   equivalent
  </span>
  , it&#39;s called a Nascar dad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Is Nascar some kind of car racing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, basically it&#39;s just the, these cars they run around and ride around in a circle. It&#39;s kind of like horse racing for cars, you just go round and round. But, yeah, so I guess it&#39;s the same thing. It&#39;s just a dad who&#39;s really, you know, really into his kids, spends a lot of time with his kids.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Would this be a stay at home dad, like a...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, no. It&#39;s just kind of like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   good old boy
  </span>
  father, like a dad who&#39;s kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   blue collar
  </span>
  , not rich, you know, maybe lower middle class maybe but just kind of like your typical sitcom,
  <span class="audionotes">
   TV sitcom dad
  </span>
  I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  But that&#39;s nice. Takes his kids everywhere, that&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Involved in the...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, like a Nascar dad would probably take his sons hunting and maybe take his daughter shopping and stuff like that.
