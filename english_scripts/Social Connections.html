  Alex
 </strong>
 : Hi, Katia, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m doing good and you Alex?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m doing good thank you. I have a question for you. Are you on Facebook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yes, I am in Facebook but I really do not check very often.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : OK, how often do you check it usually?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : I actually try not to check it very often. It&#39;s been taking a lot of my time so right now I check it about, I try once a week during the weekends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : OK. I used to be on Facebook a lot before. I was like checking it every day and, you know, posting on my friends&#39; walls and trying to
  <span class="audionotes">
   catch up
  </span>
  with everybody on Facebook. But then I realised that I was losing a lot of time on it. I was, I don&#39;t know if investing is the word, but I was spending a lot of time on it and I kind of like decided to close my wall, because I thought that I was just spending too much time, and it was not really adding anything so, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the right thing, because sometimes I feel that I need to communicate stuff to my friends and since my wall has been closed for so long, I don&#39;t want to kind of like just communicate something there and then just stopped communicating through my wall any more so I don&#39;t know how to do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : It has really become
  <span class="audionotes">
   an issue
  </span>
  hasn&#39;t it? You can get lost from what is actually happening around you and live in a
  <span class="audionotes">
   virtual world
  </span>
  so I&#39;m actually a little bit worried about that, about what is happening and how we live our lives and how we
  <span class="audionotes">
   present
  </span>
  ourselves to others. I believe that it should be handled differently than it has up to now so maybe you&#39;re doing good by closing or, you know, thinking about it at least.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : But how much, that you might have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   consider
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that&#39;s right. It&#39;s very funny how all this communication has changed in the last few years. I remember just four years ago or even five years ago I wasn&#39;t on Facebook and all the communication I used to have with my friends was through email or by phone or by meeting you know. But now with Facebook everybody spends so much time on Facebook. Sometimes if you don&#39;t publish something on Facebook, it seems that you didn&#39;t do anything so I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just weird.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Well the question is are you actually more in communication now than you were four or five years ago?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I am more in communication with people that I haven&#39;t been in touch with for the last ten years let&#39;s say. Like all my friends from elementary school that I wasn&#39;t really in touch and everybody&#39;s now on Facebook and now everybody is updated on what I&#39;m doing or why I do this, what I&#39;m going to do on next vacation, what about my plans for anything so that&#39;s a good thing I think. It really depends on how much importance you give to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : That is true.
