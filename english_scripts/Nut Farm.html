   Marion:
  </strong>
  While I traveling in Australia I went to visit my friend Nicola, um, she&#39;s teaching in a school on the East Coast of Australia, so I went to visit her about a month ago and she&#39;s staying on a farm, she lives on a macadamia farm, so my friend and I went to visit her and stay at her place, so as part of the deal we had to go out and pick macadamia nuts for two hours every day, so usually we&#39;d get up quite early in the morning and we&#39;d go out and pick macadamia nuts for about an hour, and then just before it got dark in the afternoon or the evening we&#39;d go out and pick nuts again for another hour.

  It was a lot of fun I think mainly because, you know, it wasn&#39;t a proper job. We could take our time and we always had a laugh and a joke while we were there. Um, it was really nice to work outside, for awhile, you know, to work in the sunshine and also I&#39;d never worked with macadamia trees before. Before I&#39;d left Ireland I don&#39;t think I&#39;d even heard of macadamia trees, cause I think they&#39;re a nut that&#39;s native to Australia. I know they&#39;re very popular in Hawaii as well. I think they were first cultivated for, for profit reasons in Hawaii. Yeah, so macadamia nuts are really, really tasty, so they&#39;re very popular as souvenirs from Australia, so you often get chocolate covered macadamia nuts, or macadamia cookies to bring to your friends when you come home from Australia. What else can you get with Macadamia nuts? You can just eat them on their own as well, they&#39;re very, very tasty. When we came back for breakfast, we used to bring a handful of macadamia nuts with us and use the nut cracker to open them up cause they&#39;ve got a very very hard shell, so even if you throw them on the ground, it&#39;s very difficult to open them up, so you have to have a nutcracker, to really crush the shell, and once you open them up inside, they&#39;re very white, very pale in color and they almost look like nuggets of white chocolate. It&#39;s quite strange and they have a real creamy taste to them, so they&#39;re, yeah, probably one of my favorite things to eat in Australia.
