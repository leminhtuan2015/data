   Simon:
  </strong>
  Like many people, I like to travel and there are many ways you can travel, uh, many forms of transportation. Probably the main three that I wanna talk about now are by car, by train and by airplane. Now each of these forms of transportation
  <br>
  have there pros and cons. Would you agree?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  Indeed, I would.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  So, what&#39;s your favorite form of transportation, of those three?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  I would have to say the automobile.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Um, well, tell me some of the, the pros of traveling by car.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  That would be mainly freedom. Freedom of movement. Freedom of stop. Freedom to go. Freedom to, yeah, freedom basically.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  OK, uh, what about a train? What are the advantages of being of a train?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  Ah, I would say, good views of the countryside. You can move around on a train. You&#39;re not stuck in a car. You can go for a cigarette. You can get something to drink. You can go to the bathroom, which you cannot do in a car.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  OK, and let&#39;s talk about the airplane. Why, what are some of the advantages of flying?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  Speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s all I can say about that, speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  OK, uh, let&#39;s talk about the disadvantages, the cons. So what, what are some things that a train has, that is not that great?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s nothing I can say bad about a train, except, yeah! Train&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  OK!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  Price!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, price, in many countries train travel is expensive. Uh, we are traveling in Japan, so the train is very fast and efficient, however, it is expensive, and another thing is, you&#39;re confined by schedule and things like that. How about the disadvantages of a car?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  Ah, pollution, accidents, cost, yeah, cars can be expensive, too, maintenance, gas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  And how about the plane?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Friend:
  </strong>
  The disadvantages of a plane. The lack of view,and yeah, that stale, stale air.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, also, I could sort of say the fear factor, yeah, and being confined to a small space. Yeah that&#39;s it.
 </p>
