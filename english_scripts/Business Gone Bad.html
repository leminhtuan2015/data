   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Kevin, you were saying that you&#39;ve been poor, broke, a couple of times.  You talked about being in New York, and being broke.  When else have you been broke?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Wow.  Well, after New York, the following year, when I came down from New York, I was determined to be my own boss.  I had not been
  <span class="audionotes">
   in control of
  </span>
  my life while I was in New York.  It was all depending on other people to let me have a job.  And when I lost the job, that really, that really hurt.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so when I went home I decided that I was going to own my own business, and I opened my first business which was a Karate school, and I put a lot of money into it that I had worked for almost a year saving up and then, well I also had a small
  <span class="audionotes">
   inheritance
  </span>
  from my grandmother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah.  But I ended up losing all of the money in the Karate school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now did you actually know Karate?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  I do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I did not know that about you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  That would have been a strange business to start if I didn&#39;t know it.  But yeah, yeah, I&#39;d done it, I started when I was a kid.  And, at the time, I was 20, I think 20, just about to turn 21 when I opened it.  And I was ni-dan at the time, second degree black belt, and I had been teaching at my instructor&#39;s school for a while and he had encouraged me, you know, to go ahead and do it.  But it was the wrong location, and the wrong town, the town was really poor.  And I lost about $20,000 in 6 months.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a lot of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  That is a lot of money.  Especially to a 21 year old who, you know...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, $20,000 when you&#39;re 21, you can live for like 3 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Right, and not a year and half earlier I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   flat busted
  </span>
  broke in New York, and then, you know, things
  <span class="audionotes">
   picked up
  </span>
  and I thought that I could really try and make something of it.  But you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   nothing ventured, nothing gained
  </span>
  , and that was the attitude that I had, and, you know, found myself broke again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So that fact that you&#39;ve been poor, but you were poor both times when you were very young, do you look back and are you glad that you had those experiences?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Sure.  Sure, I learned a lot.  Those experiences were valuable.  You can&#39;t buy that kind of experience, you know, I carry it around with me now.  I listen to other people who have business ideas and, you know, one thing that I gained from it is I can tell if they are going into a business, if they&#39;re gonna try and start up a business and, you know, they haven&#39;t considered all the things that they really need to consider, I can see
  <span class="audionotes">
   the pitfalls
  </span>
  that I fell in.  And, you can try and suggest people to, you know, make other arrangements or to be more careful about this or that, but it doesn&#39;t always
  <span class="audionotes">
   work out
  </span>
  .  Sometimes they just have to go out and
  <span class="audionotes">
   learn the hard way
  </span>
  like I did.
