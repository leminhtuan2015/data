   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ebony, we were looking at the internet and we saw that the U.S. is going to try to put people on the moon, again, in a few years. What do you think about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  OK, about people on the moon, I think it&#39;s really cool! I say that as a natural reaction, but I know they&#39;ve tried it before. I think it would be maybe a good idea economically, but then again not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sure
 </p>
 <p>

   Ebony:
  </strong>
  I mean, because first of all, how are we finacially in the US? What are they doing? I think they are trying to
  <span class="audiodef">
   pick up spirits
  </span>
  or distract right now with all the other
  <span class="audiodef">
   underlying
  </span>
  issues!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  Honestly, when I heard that, I was like, is this some kind of propoganda, some kind of
  <span class="audiodef">
   billboard distraction
  </span>
  in my opinion, I mean, it&#39;s an
  <span class="audiodef">
   awesome
  </span>
  idea though if you really think behind it, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what we should be looking at right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sure, so do you think it is a waste of money or do you think it helps science?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  I think eventually it&#39;s a great thing, and it does help, and I think it&#39;s a wonderful thing to be paying attention to, but I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s the right moment for it. But either way, they&#39;re doing it, so I think it would be really neat, I mean I&#39;ve always wanted to say to my, you know, one day my kids, &#34;Ok, let&#39;s go to vacation on the moon...I feel like going out to the suite hotel you know.Let&#39;s go look at the stars&#34; you know a few meteors passing by, wouldn&#39;t that be neat..to say that and really be able to do that someday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Gosh, it must be really, really beautiful on the moon. Well, actually, you are very young. I think 20! 20 years old?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, do you think that is going to be possible, that...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  Yeah! Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  Since I was 10. Since I was 10 years old my father would always say to me, you know, he&#39;s about 62 right now, and so, he said, I&#39;ve seen everybody go from cars to everything and all the advances in technology is so fast, he said, &#39;I can&#39;t imagine when your are my agewhat&#39;s it&#39;s going to be like for you at the rate technology is advancing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  So I thought, &#34;Wow, that&#39;s really cool!&#34; I&#39;ll be able to do that and I always did. I always thought that and so, in a way too I&#39;m saying, &#34;What took you so long guys?&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, so that&#39;s amazing. You could actually be going for vacation to the moon in forty years
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  Wouldn&#39;t that not be cool!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  Just sit there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Or Mars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  Mars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah! Lot of rocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  The red planet. I don&#39;t know about mars. I think the moon sounds kind of cooler not as far.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  It depends on what they do with travel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. You definitely would need a
  <span class="audiodef">
   round-trip
  </span>
  ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ebony:
  </strong>
  OK, thanks a lot Ebony
 </p>
