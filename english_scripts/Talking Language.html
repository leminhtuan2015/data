   Sarah
  </strong>
  : So tell me, what languages do you speak?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, I speak two languages. I speak Thai and I speak Japanese. But my Japanese is not so good and my Thai is just okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, I live in Japan so I study Japanese and I use Japanese everyday. I can speak Japanese at the supermarket. I can use Japanese at a hotel or with a taxi driver, but I cannot have a long conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yeah. And you, what languages do you speak?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Well, I speak English, of course. And I speak Spanish and Japanese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. Spanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I lived in Ecuador, and so I spoke Spanish everyday, a lot. I used to think I was fluent. Maybe I forgot some Spanish now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, so you can read, speak, write everything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. In Ecuador, I did everything. I signed my cellphone contract. I could read that in Spanish. I was – all of my friends I spoke Spanish with, and I spoke Spanish all the time. But my Japanese is like yours. I can speak only enough to go to the grocery or ask when the bus leaves or buy a train ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s difficult. It&#39;s hard to have a good conversation in Japanese. But I can read Japanese. I studied Kanji.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So my reading is okay, but my speaking is just really bad. I have bad pronunciation. So because my Japanese pronunciation is not very good, Japanese people don&#39;t like to speak Japanese with me, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : My Spanish pronunciation is really bad because I always spoke with other foreigners who are also studying Spanish. So there would be a Korean person, me, a Norwegian person, and we were all speaking Spanish together. So we all had bad pronunciation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : What about Thai?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I can speak Thai. My Thai is different. My Thai pronunciation is okay. So I can have conversations in Thai. I lived in Thailand when I was young, so – or I was 22 to 26. So I studied it and I like Thai. But reading in Thai is difficult for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I can read Japanese better than I can read Thai but I can speak Thai better, and my Thai listening is better also.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Ah. Do you have any Thai friends?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I do have some Thai friends. And now, I study Thai on Facebook. So everyday, I check my friends&#39; messages on Facebook. And then I use Google translate to learn new words. So it&#39;s very good. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Do you think you&#39;ll live in Thailand again, someday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Maybe. I will visit Thailand again. I don&#39;t think I will live in Thailand again. But I like to go to Thailand because Thai is fun to speak and Thailand has great food and great weather, good beaches. So it&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Oh great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about you? Do you want to live in Ecuador, again?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Not Ecuador. I love Ecuador but I want to live in another Spanish-speaking country. I&#39;d like to live in Argentina, maybe or Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is part of America but they speak Spanish there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I hear Puerto Rico is really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I went there for one week and it was just amazing. It has beaches and mountains, and the people are really fun. And it&#39;s a really exciting place to visit.
