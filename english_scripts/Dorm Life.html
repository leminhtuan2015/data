   Todd:
  </strong>
  Miki, when you were in college where did you live?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Miki:
  </strong>
  My first year I lived in the dormitory that was quite close to the campus. It was about a five minute walks so it was very convenient but I&#39;m not sure that that many people actually enjoyed living in the dormitory because there were so many of us packed into such a small space that one did not get a sense of privacy at all. I shared a room with two other girls and 24 hours a day there was always someone near you, next door, down the hall if not in your own room, and a very small space. In Japan perhaps this wouldn&#39;t have been such a large problem because the sense of personal space and privacy perhaps isn&#39;t as strong growing up, but really in the United States if you grow up with you own room, it you grow up with your own
  <span class="audionotes">
   sense of self
  </span>
  and if, you know, you have personal space that you define just
  <span class="audionotes">
   instinctively
  </span>
  which, you know, maybe three feet in front of you, a meter, or if you have your own personal room itself, it&#39;s very difficult to move from that sort of sense of individuality and personal
  <span class="audionotes">
   private
  </span>
  space, to move into the dorms, and to have to share, all of that, and then always have a smile on your face, if you don&#39;t want to be considered a bitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so what about food? What did you eat for food? Did you have a kitchen? Did you cook?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Miki:
  </strong>
  In the dormitories, no! We had a dining hall. I don&#39;t quite remember what it was called, but it was a common area where everyone went downstairs at the same time. It was only open, three hours in the morning, 3 hours in the evening, and we all shared our time together, kind of like a family, I suppose, and we must have eaten just normal American food. I don&#39;t remember.
  <br>
  Todd: Yeah! Yeah! How about your laundry? How would you wash your clothes?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Miki:
  </strong>
  That I forget! I think we had laundry machines every other floor in the dorm building. But I actually don&#39;t remember. Sorry!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And what would students do for fun? for socializing?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Miki:
  </strong>
  Oh, I think the bigger question is whether students did anything besides
  <span class="audionotes">
   socialize
  </span>
  , you know, right, I mean, if you&#39;re a freshman the chances of you actually doing work are actually quite small, especially in that sort of a social setting where,
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Even at Beckley?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Miki:
  </strong>
  Oh, are you kidding me? Yes! Berkley is highly competitive but it&#39;s also highly, it&#39;s a highly social atmosphere, especially in the dorms, well, and then once you move into a
  <span class="audionotes">
   communal
  </span>
  area, if you&#39;re there with your friend, then I don&#39;t think a whole lot of studying goes on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s funny! Oh, thanks!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Miki:
  </strong>
  Surely!
