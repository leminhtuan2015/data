   Well, I&#39;m going to talk a little bit about why I&#39;m vegetarian. Actually, I became vegetarian when I was 8 years old. We did a project at school and I found out that animals are actually killed for us to eat and as an 8 year-old I thought that was rather immoral, so I went home and I told my parents that I didn&#39;t want to eat meat anymore so now I eat everything really except for meat and fish and I don&#39;t eat things with animals fats in either. I think really I&#39;m a vegetarian now because it&#39;s a habit and if I were to eat meat, I think I would be quite ill. My favorite food is probably tofu although I like broccoli and I like chocolate as well.

   Sometimes because I like traveling, I go to places and it&#39;s really difficult for vegetarians because they don&#39;t really have anything for vegetarians to eat, so sometimes I just have like, a bowl of rice, or an omelet, or something like that, but when I&#39;m at home, I like to cook for myself, and I like to cook nice vegetarian dishes, and stews and things like that. My parents didn&#39;t mind me becoming a vegetarian, and I think they were really good about it because I don&#39;t know many people, who when their child said they wanted to be a vegetarian would except that, so I was really grateful to my parents for being so nice and understanding about it.
