President Donald Trump says the United States will back out of a global arms trade treaty.
<br><br>
As AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani tells us, Trump made the announcement Friday during a speech to the gun rights group, the National Rifle Association.
<br><br>
The treaty regulates international trade in conventional weapons and has been waiting Senate ratification since President Obama signed it in 2013.
<br><br>
"We're taking our signature back."
<br><br>
President Trump making the announcement during a speech to the NRA, which says the treaty threatens the Second Amendment.  He says Democrats threaten it as well.
<br><br>
"You let these maniacs get into office, they will take that right away."
<br><br>
Urging NRA members to vote Republican.  The group was key to his 2016 election butt has been limping toward 2020 divided and diminished.

The president's speech came shortly after a U.S. federal judge sentenced a Russian gun rights proponent to 18 months in prison for conspiring with a senior Russian official to infiltrate the National Rifle Association.
<br><br>
As AP's Ben Thomas reports, Maria Butina's goal was to influence U.S. conservative activists and Republican politicians to benefit the Kremlin.
<br><br>
Maria Butina admitted to trying to infiltrate and gather intelligence on the National Rifle Association and other conservative U.S. political groups at the direction of a former Russian lawmaker.
<br><br>
She pled guilty to a single charge - conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent - as part of a deal with federal prosecutors.
<br><br>
Butina has been jailed since her arrest in July of last year and, with credit for time served, will spend another nine months behind bars.
<br><br>
The judge also ordered she be deported upon completing her sentence.
<br><br>
Butina said she was ashamed and embarrassed by her actions.

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said on Friday that police are looking for 140 people believed to have links with the Islamic State group over last Sunday's attacks on churches and hotels that killed 253 people.
<br><br>
A Sri Lankan military spokesman says soldiers exchanged gunfire with suspects after attempting to raid a building in the country's Eastern Province as part of the ongoing investigation.
<br><br>
Authorities found a stock pile of explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture bombs.  Police also seized clothing and flags linked to the Islamic State group, gelignite sticks, 100,000 ball bearings, drones and at least one suicide vest during the raid.
<br><br>
Officials say local militants with ties to IS conducted a series of suicide bombings on Easter Sunday at churches and local luxury hotels in and around Colombo and in the seaside village of Batticaloa.

Cyclone Kenneth smashed into northern Mozambique, leaving one person dead Friday, barely one month after a superstorm hit the center of the country, devastating the area and leaving hundreds dead.
<br><br>
Emergency officials said 30,000 people have been evacuated from the areas the storm would likely hit.
<br><br>
Clare Nullis is with the World Meteorological Organization.  "Mozambican authorities evacuated thousands of people which we hope limited the loss of life.  And Tanzania, which also has never seen tropical cyclones, issued a red alert to warn people of the risks, and those red alerts continue today, the warning of floods and landslides."
<br><br>
Kenneth descends on Mozambique just weeks after the country was hit by Cyclone Idai which the U.N. labeled as "one of the deadliest storms on record in the southern hemisphere."
<br><br>
Officials have warned that Kenneth could be even stronger than Idai as it targets an area not used to such storms.
<br><br>
A U.N. spokesman says this is the first time on record that Mozambique has been hit by two cyclones in one season.
<br><br>
<br><br>
The International Organization for Migration says authorities in Yemen have rounded up and detained more than 2,000 migrants, predominantly Ethiopians.
<br><br>
Spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the IOM is "deeply concerned about the conditions in which these migrants, including 400 children, are being held."
<br><br>
The IOM said the detentions began on Sunday in the south of the country, which is under the control of the internationally recognized government backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
<br><br>
A Saudi-led coalition has been battling Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels since 2015.  The conflict has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
