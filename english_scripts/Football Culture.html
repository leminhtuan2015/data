  Daniel:
 </strong>
 Hey, Vale, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Fine, and you, Daniel, how are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Very well thanks. I have a question for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  OK, tell me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Since you&#39;re from Argentina, I&#39;d have to ask you about soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Yes, sure. What do you want to know about soccer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Argentina is really famous for soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Because I&#39;ve seen it from the news but I don&#39;t have the feeling or I don&#39;t really know how Argentinian people live football.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  OK, let me tell you that for us, football is something like natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  What do you mean by that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s like when especially if you are a boy, when you come back from school after having lunch what we do is like going with your friends to play soccer on the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  On the street?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Yes. Like this, meaning that everybody has the experience of playing soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I have it myself too. I used to do that when I was a kid.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  So meaning that in Chile it&#39;s kind of the same?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think you, since you can run and kick the ball, I mean everyone practice football or soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  How about the teams?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  What about them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  How you choose a team in your country?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s, I think that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   an issue
  </span>
  . You have to choose just one team basically.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  What do you mean just one team?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  You can&#39;t support several teams, it&#39;s just one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  I see and it should be the same through all your life or can we, or you can change?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK, you can change but it&#39;s not really, it&#39;s not allowed actually by your friends or your family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Sorry, does anybody change team?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve seen some people who have changed but they&#39;re not really like into soccer. If you&#39;re really into soccer you would never change it and not because of your group or not because of society, because if you&#39;re really into football that&#39;s if you choose a team, that&#39;s the team you
  <span class="audionotes">
   support
  </span>
  forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Because in Argentina
  <span class="audionotes">
   it is said
  </span>
  there are two things that you cannot change, your mum and your team.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK, that&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  No matter how bad things are for your team, you have to support, you will support the same team all your life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we don&#39;t have that
  <span class="audionotes">
   saying
  </span>
  in Chile but I think it&#39;s pretty much the same. You shouldn&#39;t change your team.
