   Todd
  </strong>
  : Rachel, I thought we would
                      talk a little bit about items and their
  <span class="audionotes">
   shelf life
  </span>
  , like how
                      long will you keep something? For example, like a
                      book or clothing, because yesterday I was talking
                      to my students and they were surprised when I
                      admitted that the shirt I was wearing, I had had
                      for over 10 years. Now, they&#39;re young and they
                      can&#39;t imagine that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : No, that might be a
                      function of being young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right, exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Because their clothes of
                      10 years ago are obviously too small.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : It depends on the
                      clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you like to keep your
                      clothes a long time?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : If I really like them, I
                      might.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. How often do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   toss out
  </span>
  your clothes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : I toss out clothes once
                      or twice a year. I&#39;ll
  <span class="audionotes">
   go
                        through
  </span>
  my wardrobe and throw out things
                      that are too small or have started to look shabby.
                      But there are other things that I just keep year
                      after year after year, probably things people
                      don&#39;t see as often like pajamas might last a
                      little longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Some people advise that
                      if you haven&#39;t worn something for six months, you
                      should throw it out, but that seems to me to be
                      not logical, given that there are four seasons and
                      they last a year. If you haven&#39;t worn something
                      for a year, maybe you should consider throwing it
                      out. But yeah, definitely, at the start of the
                      season, not in the opposite season. You have to
                      think about the weather.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. What about food? We
                      live in Japan. We&#39;re both teachers in Japan. One
                      thing I often wonder about is the sashimi and the
                      sushi, the raw fish. How long can you keep it
                      before you eat it? They say you&#39;re supposed to
                      have it that night, but I sometimes eat it the
                      next morning or even for lunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : With fish, as well as
                      other meats, I think it&#39;s very easy to tell,
                      because you can tell by the smell whether
                      something&#39;s good or not. I actually think that
                      rice is more dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, because it will
                      grow bacteria. Because it&#39;s been warm, it will
                      grow bacteria easily at room temperature. The rice
                      is the part you need to be careful about.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh. Well what about other
                      foods? Like are you somebody who&#39;s really strict
                      about the expiration date?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m not. I think the
                      expiration date on most products
  <span class="audionotes">
   errs on the side of safety
  </span>
  .
                      And another thing is people confuse the best by
                      date with the expiring date.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : The best by date is just
                      about freshness, flavor. For example with spices
                      ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And that&#39;s the date they
                      put on the package in the store.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s often the date
                      that people go by.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Sell by, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, sell by and best
                      by. For example spices might have a best by date.
                      After that, they might plump a little, they might
                      lose a little flavor, but they&#39;re not dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You can still eat it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : You can still use them,
                      yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : My rule is always three
                      days. So, I&#39;ll eat anything if it&#39;s within ...
                      except for meat, maybe, but anything if it&#39;s
                      within three days of the expiration date or the
                      sell-by date on the store&#39;s ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Oh, I think that matters
                      ... To me it makes an enormous difference what it
                      is. For example, moyashi, which is bean sprouts,
                      I&#39;ll eat them on the day or the day after, but not
                      after that. They start getting bad really quickly.
                      But, for example, a jar of pickles, that&#39;s going
                      to last much longer than the three days after.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. I think the big
                      one, I guess, you&#39;re right about time, is dairy.
                      Milk is obvious, because milk you can smell. But
                      cheese ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : But on the other hand,
                      it just turns into yogurt.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right, yes. So that&#39;s the
                      other one is yogurt. So yogurt, I&#39;ll see it in the
                      fridge and I&#39;m like, &#34;How long can I keep this?&#34;
                      Like sometimes it&#39;ll be past the expiration date,
                      but it smells fine, it looks fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Well, yogurt is soured
                      milk, so it&#39;s difficult to say at which point it
                      sours, because it&#39;s already sour.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, and cheese too lasts
                      forever it seems like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Pretty much. You can see
                      the mold on cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So what about if you
                      see bread and there&#39;s a little mold on the bread?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Are you old school? Will
                      you cut around it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : No. I used to and I used
                      to cut the mold off cheese, but having learned
                      more about visible mold is only a small amount of
                      it and parts of mold you can&#39;t see are branching
                      into the food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So that makes it a
                      little
  <span class="audionotes">
   dodgier
  </span>
  .
                      So, no I probably wouldn&#39;t eat bread that had any
                      kind of mold on it. And I&#39;m dodgy about cheese to.
                      That&#39;s got the wrong sort of mold on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : There&#39;s the right sort
                      of mold like a blue cheese, and that&#39;s fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. And I should
                      clarify here, neither of us are medical
                      professionals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Don&#39;t take this advise.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : We&#39;re just talking about
                      our own habits here, so ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Another thing that ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about juice? What
                      about juice? Like how long can you keep juice? Can
                      you smell when juice is bad?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t usually buy
                      juice, so I don&#39;t really know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Maybe you can smell it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Maybe you can smell it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;d probably toss
                      juice because I&#39;m not experienced enough with it,
                      obviously, to have
  <span class="audionotes">
   made
                        my own mind up
  </span>
  about it, so I&#39;d probably
                      go by the date with that one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What&#39;s interesting is when
                      you see some foods that you think would last
                      forever, but actually they won&#39;t, they just have
                      an expiration date that&#39;s way in the future, like
                      canned goods.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Sometimes it&#39;s surprising
                      when you&#39;re like, &#34;Oh, there actually is an
                      expiration date on there.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : There is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : But it&#39;s way in the
                      future.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s way in the future,
                      as long as the can&#39;s not dented, I think ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Or rusty, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : ... is the rule for
                      that. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Interesting topic.
