  Hanna:
 </strong>
 OK, so we were talking about finance, so we&#39;re just going to talk a little bit about the financial crisis. What do you think about it?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I think the financial crisis is a huge mess and a lot of people don&#39;t really understand how it happened or why it happened, so I think it&#39;s important to talk about the general background of the whole thing, so basically in my own personal opinion, I think it is that credits
  <span class="audionotes">
   got out of hand
  </span>
  and they were given to people who were not able to repay those credits and the whole system collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  But at the same time, if you are taking out a loan and you have a look at the details and realize that you might not be able to pay it out, maybe you should be thinking a little more, a little bit more carefully about whether you actually can afford to take out this loan or not
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  You do have a point but I think it has to do with culture in a way because I am from Mexico and we Mexicans see Americans, that they never ... that they&#39;re always taking out loans for everything, right? So they buy a house. they take out a loan. If they buy a car, they take out a loan. So there&#39;s this common expression that Americans are always in debt, so that&#39;s the whole thing, that people were taking out loans to buy a million dollar house, a 750,000 dollar houses, when they were only able to afford 500 ... 300,000 dollar houses, but they knew they weren&#39;t going to be able to pay looking at their income statements and all that, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   regardless of all of that
  </span>
  , they still gave out those loans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true but at the same time, I think you are the person signing the contract if you&#39;re taking out the loan. I don&#39;t think being in debt is a bad thing, but I think that if you are going to take out a loan, you have to do it responsibly, so you do have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   read all the fine print
  </span>
  , and you do have get a second opinion about whether you will actually be able to keep going with this loan. I mean, as you said, if you&#39;re taking out a loan that&#39;s, you know, or mortgage, that&#39;s 750,000 grand, I mean, you&#39;re gonna be paying that for a long time, and you want to know that twenty years into the future you&#39;re not gonna end up losing your house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s the thing, like, the banks in a way ... it&#39;s all about the social contract, right, and that social contract was broken from both sides, but the banks knew that the these people we&#39;re going to lose their houses in twenty years due to their ... you know, because they weren&#39;t going to be able to pay out these loans?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes, they knew that, like I&#39;m pretty sure, because
  <span class="audionotes">
   it doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist
  </span>
  . If you look at their income statements and you do the math for twenty years at the interest rates they were charging, like I don&#39;t .... I think it was just taking advantage of the people in a way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hanna:
  </strong>
  I think the banks have been a little bit irresponsible in this matter, but in the end it is the person taking out the loan who signs the contract, so they also have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   bear some of the burden
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes, but this is not the first time that this has happened. It happened back, I don&#39;t when ... with the Asian crisis in Thailand, and it was a huge collapse around the world economy, and it happened in the States before, so it&#39;s not the first time that it has happened, so it makes you wonder why do we allow this huge financial institutions and big government to allow these things to happen.
