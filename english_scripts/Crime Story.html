  Rebecca
 </strong>
 : So, Gareth, is England a safe place to live?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Um, to be honest, no. I don&#39;t think so, but I haven&#39;t lived in England for quite a few years now, so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like now. But when I left, no. I can remember like walking back at home, having bottles thrown at me from the ops - walking along the road, the opposite road. So, yeah, and being
  <span class="audionotes">
   hassled
  </span>
  . So there&#39;s one time, I was walking back from uni and I was going to my apartment. This guy was yelling at me, and I had my headphones on, and I didn&#39;t really hear him. But he came close and he was still yelling at me, so I turned around, and he said, - Oh, I thought you&#39;re my mate. And I said, - No, no, no. I mean, you
  <span class="audionotes">
   misunderstand
  </span>
  . And he said, - Oh, okay, and he said, - Oh, I&#39;ll walk with you, I&#39;ll walk with you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, so the road that led to my apartment was so
  <span class="audionotes">
   secluded
  </span>
  , and I was a little bit wary, kind of made me feel a little bit worried. So he said, - No, I&#39;ll walk with you. So we started walking and he said, - So, do you have a cellphone? I said, - Yeah, I have a cellphone. He said, - Oh, can I use it? Can I make a phone call on it? And I said, - No. I&#39;m like, - That&#39;s all right. I don&#39;t want - yeah, I&#39;m just going to go home. And he started getting to this whole conversation about why he needed to use my cellphone, so I said, - Okay, here&#39;s my cellphone, and he took my cellphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he said, - Oh, so then, he asked me about my money, like he said, - How much money do you have on you? And I was like, - Oh, no, so I started to run. I had my big backpack on with like I had a camera in my backpack, and I was worried about him like stealing all of my stuff, so I started to run. He chased after me, and he pulled me down to the ground. And at that moment, this lady started walking down this secluded road - and yeah, if it hadn&#39;t been -
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Oh, the timing!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Yeah, if it hadn&#39;t been for her, like he would have stolen all of my stuff. And it was quite scary at the time. I was kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   shaken
  </span>
  a little bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : But as soon as she came, he just dropped everything and walked in the other direction. So, after that, I went to the police. There was a police station very close to the apartment, and they were just sipping coffee, and not really like paperwork, not really
  <span class="audionotes">
   minding the streets
  </span>
  at all. So, I went there and I reported this. There wasn&#39;t much they could do because it was an attempt to mug me, but he didn&#39;t actually steal anything. So, they&#39;re like, - So what&#39;s the point? basically. And I tried to tell them that it was maybe preventative, like if we acted now, we can prevent him from doing it again to some other poor boys -
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Actually mugging someone, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : And yeah. So they didn&#39;t do much. And so, I don&#39;t really have much of a good impression of the police in England, and also, just crime in England.
