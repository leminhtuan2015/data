  Julia:
 </strong>
 OK, so we&#39;ve talked about freelancing your skills and living and working abroad. Have you ever done that? Have you ever lived and worked in a...
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like digitally, just like a kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   nomad
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I did. I did it for a year. I was actually a nomad. I lived in five different countries and I did all my work online. I mainly was just doing web stuff but it was an interesting experience. I mean I had never, I thought it would be the perfect life and when I told people what I was going to do, everybody said that&#39;s amazing. You know, I mean basically I said that I was gonna just travel the world and I would just work from whatever city I was in. I would choose my own
  <span class="audionotes">
   itinerary
  </span>
  and my own destination and I would work when I wanted to and, yeah, I did it for ten months.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  And then why did you quit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I think you referenced it earlier. It actually became incredibly lonely. I was surprised how lonely I became. I would meet people but you would always meet people as a tourist and you didn&#39;t have family and you didn&#39;t have your social network. You didn&#39;t have people that you would see every day at work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  No workmates?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. You got no workmates, no-one to go out and have a drink with and after a while you really
  <span class="audionotes">
   crave
  </span>
  like social interaction and not always being the stranger, not always being the new person, like people that know your name and yeah, so after a while I gave it up. I remember the big thing that changed is one day I was in my hotel room, actually it was a little apartment, and I realised I had nowhere to go, I had no-one to see and I can go anywhere in the world. I had complete freedom. I could go to the airport and buy a ticket to Paris and go to Paris that day or I can go to Buenos Aires or Sydney. I could have gone anywhere in the world. There was nothing to stop me. No schedule, no appointments, no-one to
  <span class="audionotes">
   report to
  </span>
  and it was actually kind of frightening. Like it was almost
  <span class="audionotes">
   paralyzing
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s like standing on the edge of an
  <span class="audionotes">
   abyss
  </span>
  looking down.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It was. It was like, you know, I realized I wanted
  <span class="audionotes">
   normalcy
  </span>
  again. I wanted to have a schedule. I wanted to, you know, have the norm that I had before so I went back to teaching at university and now in my university job I have a lot of time to travel in between but just living around the world going from place to place, yeah, it wasn&#39;t so great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Well, I think it&#39;s great that you had the chance to explore this option. I&#39;m sure everyone would benefit maybe from trying it and then working out what it is they really
  <span class="audionotes">
   value
  </span>
  because I&#39;m sure we all think wow freedom, absolute freedom, isn&#39;t that like the ultimate goal but then when you have it, you realize well actually no, some of those constraints that I had were quite good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  They gave me a sense of being or they give structure to my life or meaning to my life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Totally, totally and actually now that I&#39;ve done it, I would do it again. I would know how to do it right. I would do it different than I did it before so, yeah, I learned. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not worth it, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   not all it&#39;s cracked up to be
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  No, and I guess ten months is a long time maybe that&#39;s the only thing, enough of a...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  But it sounds cool though. I can see the attraction definitely.
