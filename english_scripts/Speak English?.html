   Brian:
  </strong>
  Hey Fanny.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Hey, Brian.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  How&#39;s it going?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Not bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Alright, so we&#39;re asking each other questions about our countries, and last question that I asked was &#34;when is the best time to visit?&#34; but I have another question to ask
  <span class="audionotes">
   if you don&#39;t mind
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sure go ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   As you might have noticed
  </span>
  I&#39;m not Chinese, and I don&#39;t speak any Chinese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Is it going to be hard for someone who only speaks English to travel in your country?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s a good question. You know, I mean if you go to China and now if you cannot speak Chinese, of course it will be a little bit difficult for you because you know there will be 2008 Olympic games, in Beijing right, 2008 so there are a lot of Chinese people who can speak English right there so I think they can help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  See, I don&#39;t know if I would be going during the Olympic Games because, like, maybe it&#39;s really crowded and really kind of busy. I&#39;m thinking to go like maybe before that when it may be a bit quieter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Hmmm ... sorry. I think maybe I made you
  <span class="audionotes">
   confused
  </span>
  , I mean because people are getting ready for the Olympic Games,so people are just, you know, learn English to communicate with foreigners to help them and to guide them ... I mean, what I meant, you can find a lot of people who can speak English there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Oh, so
  <span class="audionotes">
   because of
  </span>
  the games many people are learning English ... but I could still ... even if I didn&#39;t go during that time, English people are
  <span class="audionotes">
   still
  </span>
  around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Right, right exactly. If you go to the shops most people there can already speak English, Japanese or Korean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Very talented people in your country.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we can say that.
