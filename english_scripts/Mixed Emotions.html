  Vella:
 </strong>
 Hey Daniel. So I was wondering can you remember any time when you were really mad, sad or embarrassed?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Well, I think I have a couple of those, a couple of each of those actually. But I don&#39;t know recently, I&#39;ve, well I had an
  <span class="audionotes">
   episode
  </span>
  that I was really sad and it was that I was applying to, I was applying for a scholarship and I was putting all the effort and I spent a lot of time and a lot of energy in it and finally it was
  <span class="audionotes">
   rejected
  </span>
  so that, that was really, really bad for me and for that year and I was really sad and I was really angry because that was my big project for that year so the fact that I couldn&#39;t get it, it made me really sad.
 </p>
 <p>
  And also you asked me about being embarrassed. I think most of the times when I was embarrassed when I was a little kid, I always was trying to do cool stuff, I don&#39;t know, hang out with friends but something, like all the time, something went wrong. For example, I don&#39;t know, I remember I was trying to play football or something and suddenly I just fell and I don&#39;t know once actually I broke my hand and that was pretty embarrassing in front of all my mates in school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  OK, so you say you were really mad and angry because you didn&#39;t get the scholarship, I was wondering how do you usually express your anger?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s better to find that out. I was very bad at it. I was, I used to express it like, I don&#39;t know, shouting or hitting stuff but now that I&#39;m a bit older I learned how to control that and I learned that not always things depends on you. Sometimes you get the results from like, I don&#39;t know, from other
  <span class="audionotes">
   factors
  </span>
  so you have to take it and you have to learn to
  <span class="audionotes">
   live with
  </span>
  that and, but that takes time. So, yeah, at the beginning I was really mad and I was really sad but then I understood that probably it wasn&#39;t the time so when you understand and when you go through that kind of stuff you learn and then you learn not to get that emotional at the beginning and to think over it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I agree after you learn from those experiences and you just become better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t know if better but I definitely learned something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  You&#39;ll know, you know, how to
  <span class="audionotes">
   handle
  </span>
  things when you face them again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I hope I don&#39;t have to handle that kind of stuff again but in case I do I think I&#39;m prepared to do it now.
