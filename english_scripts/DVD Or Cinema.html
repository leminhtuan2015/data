   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Mark, I thought we would have
  <span class="audionotes">
   a mock-debate
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  OK, sounds good. What are we debating?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  We&#39;re going to debate what is better - to watch a movie on DVD or at the cinema?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  OK, well I would definitely choose DVD.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, I would say the cinema. So you go first, why is it better on DVD?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  I prefer watching movies at home because I can sit on my nice relaxing sofa. I can drink a beer. If I want to lie down on the sofa, I can lie down on the sofa. So in the cinema, you always get somebody at the side of you and they&#39;re very noisy eating popcorn or shouting and I can&#39;t focus on the movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  See, actually, I would agree that&#39;s the opposite. When you watch a movie at home. You have family members that
  <span class="audionotes">
   interrupt
  </span>
  you. The telephone rings. There&#39;s always things going on. Where in a movie, usually people are pretty quiet and you can just sit and enjoy the movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but you can tell your family members,
  <span class="audionotes">
   do not disturb
  </span>
  and switch the telephone off and then you can watch it. Also, I think recently with the quality of the TV&#39;s, it&#39;s a lot better now to watch at home, for example you&#39;ve got the plasma screen TV with the surround sound. It&#39;s just like being in the movie theater.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s something about - I like to a movie, and when you watch a movie at the cinema, you get the bigger screen. Usually nowadays the cinemas have higher quality sound. You&#39;ve got your popcorn, your hot dog. It&#39;s kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   a sense of excitement
  </span>
  . When you sit down to watch a movie at home there&#39;s not a sense of excitement.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right, well, I agree that the movie theater has improved. For example recently they&#39;ve got the beautiful comfortable chair. I live in Japan now, and in Japan you can get a beer at the movie theater. Can you get a beer in America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  No, you can&#39;t in England as well. I like to drink a beer when I&#39;m watching a movie. So the movie theater has improved, but you have to go to the theater. What happens if it&#39;s raining, you don&#39;t want to go. If it&#39;s snowing, you don&#39;t want to go. Whereas at home, now you don&#39;t need to the DVD store. You can get them via your TV, right. Just press the magic button.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  True. So the question is, do you think there will even be cinemas is say twenty years, thirty years?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;ve noticed in the last ten years, that the small cinemas in the cities have usually closed, and they&#39;re moving out of town to the big
  <span class="audionotes">
   multiplexes
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  So the number of cinemas has reduced in the past ten years, I think, and it will probably continue to do that. We got a home cinema now. And people are buying huge screen TV&#39;s or they are getting all the latest technology in their home. It&#39;s cheap enough to buy now, so I&#39;d probably say that cinemas will be no longer in about then years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ten years!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I hope they don&#39;t go away too fast cause I still like them.
