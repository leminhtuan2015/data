   Todd
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m here with Rachel. We
                      were talking about expiration dates. You were
                      saying that you throw out your clothes regularly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Fairly regularly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Do you donate them
                      or just toss them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : I put them in the
                      recycling.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : There you go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : And hope they&#39;re going
                      to be remade into something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I guess, yeah I
                      always take it out on the day that they&#39;ll say
                      that they&#39;ll pick up clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Yeah. The reason for
                      that is because I usually put, throw clothes out
                      when they&#39;ll start to look a bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   shabby
  </span>
  , so I don&#39;t
                      think anyone else wants to wear them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : By that stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about furniture? How
                      often do you try to get new furniture?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Almost never.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s something I don&#39;t
                      ... Yeah, I&#39;ll
  <span class="audionotes">
   put up
                        with
  </span>
  what I&#39;ve got.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : It seems like such a
                      waste to throw out such large things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, but you never want
                      to replace the couch or the chair?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : The couch has been
                      replaced three or four times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s a big one, but
                      we&#39;ve still got the same kitchen table. We had got
                      to get some new chairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;ve never been a
                      big furniture guy, but I just when I see something
                      that&#39;s really cheap ... I would never buy new
                      furniture. I&#39;m always amazed like who buys new
                      furniture? Because when you walk by a store and
                      you see the furniture, it&#39;s so expensive. I&#39;m
                      gonna sound really cheap, but it&#39;s like I&#39;m like,
                      wow, why would you pay hundreds of dollars or
                      thousands of dollars for that when you can just
                      buy one used or whatever for ten bucks or twenty
                      bucks?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m definitely a used
                      furniture person now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : When we moved into our
                      house we did go to a furniture store and bought
                      all new furniture. It&#39;s easy. It&#39;s done.
                      Everything looks new. It&#39;s kind of nice, but I
                      almost
  <span class="audionotes">
   exclusively
  </span>
  buy second hand furniture now. Depending on which
                      store you go to, you can get some really good
                      bargains on some beautiful old antique, that look
                      really nice in your house, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   cost a fraction
  </span>
  of
                      something new.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. That&#39;s why you like
                      anything that&#39;s made with metal or wood because
                      you usually think it&#39;s going to age well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Plastic, not so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : No, no. I&#39;ve definitely
                      sworn off plastic. I think plastic&#39;s a fill in if
                      you need something quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : And cheaply, but
                      definitely don&#39;t like to buy plastic now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about electronic
                      goods, like getting a new TV, a new refrigerator,
                      stuff like that? How often do you buy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : We just wait until that
  <span class="audionotes">
   breaks down
  </span>
  .
                      That&#39;s a pretty easy one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about the TV though?
                      The TVs don&#39;t break down. They go on forever. How
                      often do you think, oh I want a new TV, I want a
                      new nicer TV?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Our last TV broke.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It did?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Well, we had lightening
                      hit the house, and we lost several electronic
                      items.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : We lost a keyboard, and
                      a computer. I think we lost two out of ... We had
                      three hard disc DV players.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It was an electrical
  <span class="audionotes">
   surge
  </span>
  that fried all
                      the circuits?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : It fried the house, yeah
                      pretty much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. I did not know that
                      could happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
