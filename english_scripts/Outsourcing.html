  Julia:
 </strong>
 Hey Todd, just talking about your website. Do you do everything on that site, all the
 <span class="audionotes">
  recordings
 </span>
 , the editing, everything?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I used to. Yeah, I think up till the first, for the first six years I did everything. I did, I would record the audio that&#39;s step one. And then I would edit the audio and then I would transcribe it and then after I would transcribe it, I would write the quiz and then I would find photos for the audio and then I would make the multimedia which was usually Flash, then I would organise it and upload it on to a web server. So, yeah, I used to do everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Ah, you&#39;re multi-skilled.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well I learned from it. I learned how to do a little of everything so it was good. But now I actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   outsource
  </span>
  a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  What does that mean? You have other people do those parts for you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Like usually I have now around six to seven people around the world that help me out. So I just find people, like
  <span class="audionotes">
   digital assistants
  </span>
  online, and they specialize in one thing and then I hire them through different agencies and then they do the work for me. So it&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  And how do you choose who you are going to use for those tasks?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well usually what you do is you post a job on a site, you place a bid or you just post a job and then different contractors post a bid and you can look at their experience and then if you find somebody that&#39;s say an audio editor or a transcriptionist or a photo editor then you
  <span class="audionotes">
   hire
  </span>
  them and you could either pay them one set fee for like one job or you can pay them by the hour and I usually pay people by the hour. So like right now I have a transcriptionist who works from Spain, she&#39;s a retired secretary and she does all the
  <span class="audionotes">
   transcriptions
  </span>
  for me now so there&#39;s fewer mistakes. There&#39;s a student in America who&#39;s Chinese who finds my images and she crops them now. It&#39;s like a part time job. There&#39;s a guy in India who edits a lot of my audio now so he&#39;s a professional sound engineer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and I send him the audio and he does that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  So these people are all working like freelancers in their specific field?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, usually what they do is they are professional and maybe they moonlight at night, they do a little extra work or in some cases they just have a part time job and they want to make a little extra money working online or it&#39;s their career actually and they work for many people so they&#39;ll
  <span class="audionotes">
   cobble
  </span>
  together many contracts with different people. Like for example the transcriptionist, I know that she does transcription work for five or six contractors or companies so she&#39;s always busy. And actually everybody who works for me has contracted work with other people, so yeah, so it&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  And you have direct contact with these people or do you just deal with them via the agencies?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You can. Well it&#39;s an online agency. I use a company called oDesk and I also use another company called Freelancer and they can contact me through there. They usually don&#39;t like you to email directly but usually you have to give them your email and then sometimes they email me and we just, you know, contact
  <span class="audionotes">
   back and forth
  </span>
  . And it&#39;s great, we have, we use DropBox so DropBox is a service where we can all share the same folder so we can just share files online and they do whatever work I need done and that&#39;s it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Wow, it sounds great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Convenient
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Are you always happy with the quality of the work you get then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Usually most people are really good. I mean sometimes you get contractors that aren&#39;t the best but yeah it&#39;s good. And you know the thing is it doesn&#39;t cost that much money. You know you might have let&#39;s say somebody does ten hours of work one week and you know they make ten dollars an hour, I mean in some countries that&#39;s a lot of money, that&#39;s pretty good money so they get a pretty decent wage and you get really good value for your money and it&#39;s a real big help for me. I can do more with the website by outsourcing it.
