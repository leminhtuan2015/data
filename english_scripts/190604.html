U.S. President Donald Trump on a state visit to Britain attended a state dinner hosted by Queen Elizabeth on Monday night.  It was the first of a three-day visit to Britain.  It will also include talks with outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May.
<br><br>
President Trump wore a white tie and tails and the queen, Mrs. Trump and several other women in the royal family wore white dresses to the lavish affair.
<br><br>
The queen read a message of welcome to Mr. Trump and the first lady.  "I am delighted to welcome you and Mrs. Trump to Buckingham Palace this evening just twelve months after our first meeting at Windsor."
<br><br>
President Trump toasted the eternal friendship as he called it between Britain and the United States.  "On behalf of all Americans, I offer a toast to the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations, and to the long, cherished, and truly remarkable reign of Her Majesty the Queen.  Thank you."
<br><br>
On Tuesday, the president meets with British political leaders including the outgoing prime minister, May.  She is expected to resign on Friday after failing to complete Britain's exit from the European Union.
<br><br>
Trump has publicly backed former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson to succeed her.  He told reporters before departing the White House late on Sunday, he may meet with Johnson while he is in London.
<br><br>
In the past, he has criticized May's handling of the Brexit impasse.
<br><br>
<br><br>
United Nations Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres has condemned an attack earlier today by Sudanese security forces that broke up a protest in Khartoum.

Chicago police say the city has weathered its most violent weekend of the year, with 52 people shot and 10 killed.
<br><br>
Since Friday, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson on Monday said the city had reached what he called a "despicable level of violence."
<br><br>
Police believe the majority of the violence comes from gang activity.  Johnson said a total of 92 firearms were seized [on] since Friday or [near doub...] nearly doubled the amount seized in a typical weekend.

White House economist Kevin Hassett says his decision to step down after nearly two years on the job has nothing to do with President Trump's proposed new tariffs on Mexico.
<br><br>
Hassett ??? reporters on Monday that he and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had been discussing his departure for weeks.
<br><br>
"Yeah, it's absolutely my decision.  Mick Mulvaney and I have been talking about it for a few weeks.  We, I've been looking ahead to the summer for quite sometime."
<br><br>
He said his position as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers is meant to be an objective one and over time such advisers tend to lose their objectivity.
<br><br>
"The turnover of study institutions is very important because CEA is meant to be kind of like CBO - this objective adviser, and the longer you stay here the closer you get with everybody and maybe the harder it's to be objective."
<br><br>
President Trump announced Hassett's departure on Sunday and said via Twitter that he'll name a replacement when returns from this week's visit to Britain and Ireland.

AP's Charles De Ledesma has more.
<br><br>
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has backed away from barring from some of its activities employees of Chinese tech ??? Huawei.  The group made the announcement after the Department of Commerce clarified its stance on the issue which rose after the U.S. put Huawei on an entity list, effectively barring U.S. firms from selling its technology.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, fresh data shows a widening fallout from the tech clash between the two biggest economies after China's perennially huge trade surpluses and its efforts to leap ahead in advanced technology.
