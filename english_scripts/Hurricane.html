   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Ivan, in America, in California we have earthquakes. Do you have any natural disasters in Houston?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Uh, it floods a lot and we get hurricanes. Houston&#39;s called a bayou city. Bayou is kind of like a dirty river. Sometimes it rains a lot, that thing fills up over, and the next thing you know you got water in your house. Hurricanes are really, really angry typhoons I think. The first hurricane I ever remember we name our hurricanes, you give them names, usually girl names, and the first hurricane I remember was back in 1984 named &#34;Hurricane Alice&#34; I believe. Um, I was in a soccer camp. It starts raining, oh my God it&#39;s raining, trees are falling down and cars are kind of being pushed away from the water and stuff and I&#39;m scared to death that my parents are dead right. I was only seven years old. So I remember, I couldn&#39;t remember my phone number and the camp counselors were trying to look it up. Call up: ring, ring, ring. My mom answers the phone, &#34;Are you OK? Are you OK?&#34; &#34;Yes, Ivan, we&#39;re OK. Don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s just a rain storm.&#34; But it was an absolute mess. The next day, the soccer field is completely wiped out. It was, yeah, they&#39;re big angry storms.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How long does a hurricane usually last?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Usually, about two or three days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, they just kind of stay in Houston. They like Houston. Something about the weather pattern. They just float to Houston and stay there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man, that&#39;s pretty intense. So afterward everything is just kind of wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Ah, a lot of windows are broken. I said a lot of cars are upside down sometimes, cause the wind is really, really high, plus you got the water that floats the cars, but it&#39;s fun when it stops cause the streets are flooded
  <br>
  and you can go swimming.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You swim in the water?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Sure. Sure. It&#39;s just rain water.
 </p>
