   Charlotte:
  </strong>
  Hey Jessica, you&#39;ve got a brother called Kirk?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s right. He is two and a half years older than I am and we
  <span class="audionotes">
   get along
  </span>
  very well now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Charlotte:
  </strong>
  You get along very well now. How did you get along in the past?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Not very well at all actually. He was always very mean and
  <span class="audionotes">
   heartless
  </span>
  , should we say.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Charlotte:
  </strong>
  What was the first thing you remember him doing to you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Perhaps the first thing was the time I fell asleep on the bus when I was on kindergarten. He actually left me there sleeping and I didn&#39;t wake up until my lunch box fell on the ground. When the bus driver was parking in the bus garage. So anyway, yeah, I learned
  <span class="audionotes">
   at that point
  </span>
  not to really
  <span class="audionotes">
   depend on
  </span>
  him so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Charlotte:
  </strong>
  What did your mom say when you got home?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  My mom asked my brother,&#34;Hey! Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&#34;, referring to me and he responded, &#34;Hey!
  <span class="audionotes">
   How did you know
  </span>
  I forgot my homework?&#34;
