   Kara:
  </strong>
  So, coming from such a large family, again, what do you imagine for yourself as far as family size and your ideal lifestyle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  I love having a big family. I think that is the biggest blessing in my life because there&#39;s always
  <span class="audionotes">
   someone there for you
  </span>
  . You can always talk to someone and ideally I would love it one day I had children and they had, you know, eleven or ten siblings to go to when they need help or when they just simply want to talk. That&#39;s really not gonna happen. You know, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna have many children. I would love to have enough children that I know I can actually be
  <span class="audionotes">
   financially stable
  </span>
  enough that my kids will have what they need, and they won&#39;t have to struggle when they&#39;re growing up because of money situations, but I would love to be a mom one day, and I would love to be a
  <span class="audionotes">
   stay-at-home mom
  </span>
  at that because growing up, I always had my mom there with us. She was a stay-at-home mom and it was great to wake up and have her there and come home and have her there and really to know she&#39;s there whenever we needed her, and now it&#39;s a little more difficult just because it&#39;s really expensive you know to live here and it&#39;s hard to have just one of the parents working, so ideally I would love to be a stay-at-home mom, and if it&#39;s financially possible, I would definitely do that, but if it&#39;s not then, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I wouldn&#39;t mind
  </span>
  still working and, you know, still being a full-time mom even if you are working, but I think it all depends on how many kids I have and obviously the person that I have my children with and
  <span class="audionotes">
   how we are as far as
  </span>
  money and even emotionally. We want to have a good family so the size is really not gonna be the biggest issue.
