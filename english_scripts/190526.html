President Donald Trump's first event after arriving in Tokyo was a reception with several dozens Japanese and American business leaders at the U.S. ambassador's residence.
<br><br>
VOA Steve Herman was there.
<br><br>
Trump began his visit with a 15-minute speech to several dozen top Japanese business leaders.  He told them he hopes their two countries will soon reach a new trade pact to offset the big trade imbalance in Tokyo's favor.
<br><br>
"Japan has had a substantial edge for many many years, but that's OK.  Maybe that's why you like it so much."
<br><br>
The president is to attend a banquet with the new emperor, golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and view the ancient sport of Sumo, awarding what has been nicknamed the "Trump Cup" to a champion wrestler.

<br><br>
He said he had confidence that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will, in his words, "keep his promise to me."

South Africa's new President Cyril Ramaphosa was sworn in Saturday, promising to create jobs and tackle deep-seated corruption.
<br><br>
The trade-unionist-turned-businessman took the presidential oath in front of tens of thousands at a rugby stadium in Pretoria.
<br><br>
He told his countrymen that change will be difficult but in the end will be worth it.
<br><br>
"The road ahead will be difficult and hard.  We will have to use our courage, our wisdom and perseverance to achieve this South Africa of our dream."
<br><br>
Ramaphosa's African National Congress Party clinched a 57.5 percent majority in elections earlier this month.  But that was down from 62 percent in 2014 as voters seemed to turn against the ruling party because of revelations about government corruption and record unemployment.

Pope Francis says that abortion can never be condoned even when the fetus is gravely sick or likely to die.
<br><br>
As AP's ??? reports, the pontiff urged doctors and priests to support families to carry such pregnancies to term.
<br><br>
Speaking to a Vatican-sponsored anti-abortion conference, Francis said opposition to abortion isn't a religious issue but a human one: "Is it licit to throw away a life to resolve a problem?," he asked.  "Is it licit to hire a hitman to resolve a problem?"
<br><br>
Francis denounced decisions to abort based on prenatal testing, saying a human being is "never incompatible with life."
<br><br>
Even those babies destined to die at birth or soon thereafter deserve to receive medical care in the womb, Francis said, adding that the parents need to be supported so they don't feel isolated and afraid.

A U.N. tribunal has ordered Russia to immediately release three Ukrainian naval ships and two dozen sailors who were captured in a November confrontation off the Crimean Peninsula.
<br><br>
The seizures occurred during a November 25 confrontation in the Kerch Strait, which separates Crimea from mainland Russia.  It was the first open military clash between Russia and Ukraine since Moscow's 2014 annexation of the peninsula, which is generally regarded as an illegal action.
