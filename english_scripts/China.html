   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Phil, you just got back from living in China.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I lived in China about two years ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. What was China like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  China was an
  <span class="audiodef">
   eye-opener
  </span>
  . It&#39;s a very old culture, but there&#39;s not many new, there&#39;s not many old things around in China, through wars, through the cultural revolution, a lot of stuff&#39;s been burnt, a lot of stuff just&#39;s been
  <span class="audiodef">
   knocked down
  </span>
  . One of the few old things that is there is the Great Wall of China. It&#39;s very famous this wall, very big. They are doing some efforts to try and build the wall up again, but when I was there, I believe it was August, 2002 it was still mostly old stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what else did you see in China?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Ah, I went to Xian and I saw the Terra-cotta warriors. Terra-cotta warriors were discovered shortly after Mao died in the late 70&#39;s by a farmer who was digging a well, and he was digging this well and he found all these stone warriors,literally hundreds of them, and it&#39;s a national treasure now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s
  <span class="audiodef">
   fascinating
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s really an impressive thing to see. Those are the two really old
  <span class="audiodef">
   man-made
  </span>
  things that I saw in China.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Was there anything else that was really spectacular?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  The Three Gorges tour was really good. Sadly they are all under water now because of the dam project, but I was able to go shortly before it was flooded and really, really enjoyed it. Saw a lot of beautiful things. Surprisingly enough the water was a lot cleaner than I thought and I actually went swimming in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, for, this is the Yangzhe River in China and if you&#39;ve ever seen the Yangzhe, most parts of it, you certainly wouldn&#39;t want to swim in it, but these parts were
  <span class="audiodef">
   pristine

  .
