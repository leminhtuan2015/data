   Josh
  </strong>
  : So, Shirley, I told you about my favorite restaurant. What is your favorite restaurant?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Well, my favorite restaurant is a kind of salad and soup restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay, that’s my favorite.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Great! Well, the food is very good but I also like it because the room is nice, it looks on a garden and the food is very cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : With a great view of a garden. It seems like it would be expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it does seem like it would be expensive, but it’s not. The garden has lots of beautiful flowers but also they grow herbs. So the
  <span class="audionotes">
   herbs
  </span>
  that they use in the salad are all fresh from the garden. It’s delicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : That sounds really delicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it’s great. And they make a fantastic soup.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Some cream soups, and also a really nice vegetable soup.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Great! So, is the vegetable soup your favorite dish at the restaurant?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Mmm, yes. In the wintertime, the
  <span class="audionotes">
   minestrone
  </span>
  soup is my favorite soup.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : I love minestrone soup.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It’s excellent. But in the summertime, my favorite soup is cream of potato
  <span class="audionotes">
   chilled
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Chilled?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : That means it’s served cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay, that sounds amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : It’s really
  <span class="audionotes">
   refreshing
  </span>
  in the summertime.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : What are the prices at the restaurant?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : It is so cheap. It’s about nine dollars for a small bowl of soup, a big salad, and a sandwich that usually has some salad and seafood in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : That’s really cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : We should go there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Plus, after all that, you get a coffee or herb tea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Wow, that’s great!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : I definitely recommend that you go there some time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : I’ll try it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Okay!
