  My bedroom is very messy at the moment. I&#39;m not too happy with it. I&#39;m just looking around and trying to
  <span class="audionotes">
   work myself up to
  </span>
  actually cleaning it. Em, but I don&#39;t like cleaning my bedroom. Sometimes I like it when I tidy things up and I find things that I&#39;ve forgotten that I had
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the first place
  </span>
  , that&#39;s quite nice, especially when you find maybe money or, I don&#39;t know, a voucher or something. That happened to me once that I found a voucher for a bookshop that a friend of mine had given me months before but I&#39;d completely forgotten that I had it, so that was a nice surprise but generally, generally, it&#39;s not a good thing, is it, to clean your bedroom? At the moment, just looking around, there are so many things that I need to tidy up. I&#39;ve got lots of, lots of books everywhere, in
  <span class="audionotes">
   piles
  </span>
  , in neat piles, but maybe too many piles, all over the floor, I think. Then I&#39;ve got lots of newspapers and CDs, out of their, their covers, of course, because that would be too neat! Tapes, what else? I think the worst thing for me is all the paper that I tend to accumulate, notebooks, and printouts from work, and lesson plans, and ideas I have for other lessons, so that before I know it, there&#39;s a little
  <span class="audionotes">
   paper mountain
  </span>
  on my floor. So, usually I have one paper mountain and that&#39;s not so bad, but at the moment, I have three. That&#39;s not good at all. The thing with a paper mountain is it can take you absolutely hours to get through it, before you can sort it into one category or another, and I hate throwing things away. I think that&#39;s my problem. I&#39;m a real pack-rat, I think people call them, or a
  <span class="audionotes">
   hoarder
  </span>
  . I tend to hoard things, so hoarding mean keeping things even though they&#39;re not really useful anymore. So, I&#39;m a definite hoarder. I also have loads of photographs and boxes, and, my God, way too many things. I think maybe I&#39;d better start cleaning.
