  Cheryl:
 </strong>
 So, Nick, you&#39;ve worked as an environmental scientist in Australia.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I have. I worked in my hometown in Tasmania, and in Tasmania, there&#39;s many environmental issues, particularly involving logging of native forests there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Oh, logging.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Yeah, logging.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  I recently heard about logging problems in Brazil, I mean Belize in Central America. But what kind of logging issues do you have in Tasmania?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  So, in Tasmania, there&#39;s some very old forests, maybe hundreds of thousands of years old, and some companies are destroying them,
  <span class="audionotes">
   clear-felling
  </span>
  the forest, parts of the forest there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Really! What are the companies using the forests for?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  To make paper actually. To make wood chips, and then turn wood chips into paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  So, there all paper companies?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Mm, paper companies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Or paper companies in the end. So initially, loggers, the people which log, go in, they take the trees, they take the trees to big industry, which then break them to wood chips, then make them into paper. And my job was to try to find out how we could
  <span class="audionotes">
   minimize the destructiveness
  </span>
  of that operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  So what kind of destructiveness would the impact of having deforestation in Tassie ...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  In Tassie?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Well, like many animals die
  <span class="audionotes">
   obviously
  </span>
  , and much biodiversity is taken away, but there&#39;s ways to change that process and make it better, so some solutions are instead of clear-filling, just destroying the entire forest section, just take sections out of the forests. Make the forests look like, maybe a checkerboard, so you only take patches of forests, small patches and hopefully don&#39;t kill too many animals in the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  But wouldn&#39;t that still destroy a percentage of wildlife living in those patches?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Yes, yeah, it will but we still use paper everywhere in the world, so if we use paper, well, the trees need to come from somewhere, so we need to get the practice possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Mm, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  So, it&#39;s a bit of
  <span class="audionotes">
   give-and-take
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  We can&#39;t stop using paper right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Oh, I think we should stop using paper. I think we can, but at this stage it&#39;s difficult maybe.
