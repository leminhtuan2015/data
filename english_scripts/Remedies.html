   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Keren, I thought we&#39;d talk about health.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you look very healthy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So first of all, we&#39;re going to
  <span class="audionotes">
   talk about remedies
  </span>
  . What do you do when you have a cold?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  When I have a cold, I try to rest as much as possible and stay in bed and I take lemon,
  <span class="audionotes">
   hot lemon drinks
  </span>
  and I take tablets - paracetamol - to take away my headache.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now you say you take lemon drinks. Like what exactly type of lemon drinks do you have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I just use hot water and lemon it&#39;s very refreshing and it clears your head.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. So just hot water and lemon and that&#39;s it? No honey or tea or anything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Maybe you can put a little honey in it or... and also you can buy lemon drinks which have pain killer inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now let&#39;s talk about the
  <span class="audionotes">
   hangover
  </span>
  . Do you drink?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Have you had a hangover before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yes, a few times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What&#39;s your secret for the hangover?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Sleep is my secret for the hangover, and when I have a hangover I really, really want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   eat fatty foods and sugary foods
  </span>
  and I eat lots of potato chips and I drink Coca-Cola.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the same boat
  </span>
  . I love like fast foods when I have a hangover.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s terrible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so how long does it take you usually to recover from a hangover?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  It takes me the whole day after I go out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The whole day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  The whole day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s the bummer because, like, you want to be up and out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I usually try to shoot for one or two to be back at normal full-speed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  No, it takes me the whole day. Sometimes I sleep in the afternoon. I take a nap and I feel better after that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maybe you just have stronger hangovers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Maybe.
