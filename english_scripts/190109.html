President Donald Trump will make his case for a border wall directly to the American people in just a couple of hours.  The president has demanded more than $5.5 billion to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.
<br><br>
Congressional Democrats have said they will not give the president the money.
<br><br>
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it is not the time for political gamesmanship.
<br><br>
"I would urge our Democratic colleagues to get past these harmful political games and get serious about negotiating with the president."
<br><br>
Eight hundred thousand federal employees remain either on furlough or are working without getting paid.
<br><br>
New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez said the president is playing with federal workers' lives.
<br><br>
"We have long known that something is badly broken inside the president that makes him incapable of caring about anyone other than himself."
<br><br>
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will meet with Senate Republicans Wednesday.  Trump will travel to the border on Thursday.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Meanwhile, U.S. counterterrorism officials are sticking by their assessment that terror groups like Islamic State and al-Qaeda are not actively trying to sneak operatives into the country from Mexico.  That comes despite claims by the White House and Homeland Security officials that "the threat is real."
<br><br>
A senior counterterrorism official first told VOA in November that "We do not see any evidence that ISIS or other Sunni terrorist groups are trying to infiltrate the southern U.S. border."
<br><br>
Contacted again ahead of the president's prime-time television address that official said there was no new information to cause the assessment to be updated.
<br><br>
Both the White House and the Department of Homeland Security have repeatedly emphasized the danger from suspected terrorists in recent days as a reason that a border wall is needed.

A court filing shows former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied about sharing poll data with a Russian contact.
<br><br>
The AP's Ed Donahue reports.
<br><br>
The information was accidentally revealed in a defense lawyer filing that was meant to be redacted.  The AP reviewed the material because it wasn't properly blacked out.
<br><br>
It says Manafort shared polling data during the 2016 presidential campaign with an associate accused of having ties to Russian intelligence and lied to federal investigators about it.
<br><br>
The filing does not say if the polling information was public or what was done with it.
<br><br>
Prosecutors say Manafort's lies went against their plea agreement.  He pleaded guilty in September.
<br><br>
The filing revealed the first extensive details of what Manafort lied about.

Meanwhile, a Russian lawyer who worked with Donald Trump Jr. in the president campaign has been indicted in New York.
<br><br>
AP's Warren Levinson reports.
<br><br>
A federal grand jury indicted Natalya Veselnitskaya on charges she misled investigators looking into a Russian money laundering scheme involving New York real estate.
<br><br>
Veselnitskaya is the Kremlin-connected lawyer who helped arrange the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting of Russian officials with Donald Trump Jr.  The money laundering case is not directly related.
<br><br>
The indictment charges Veselnitskaya gave investigators a fake document that supposedly cleared Russian officials in the scheme.
<br><br>
Conviction carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Jordan Tuesday, the first stop of a Middle East visit.  That's going to include stops in Cairo and several Gulf states.
<br><br>
Edward Yeranian reports from Cairo.
<br><br>
In a news conference with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, Pompeo insisted the United States has not changed its longstanding policies despite President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria.
<br><br>
"This is not just about a particular tactic that we take among the coalition.  This is about a combined understanding that the most significant threat to the region is Da'esh and the Islamist Revolution and their revolutionary efforts in the region."
<br><br>
Secretary Pompeo will visit Egypt, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE, Oman, and Kuwait during his trip.

Meanwhile, a visit to Ankara by U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton ended in acrimony Tuesday when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an refused to meet with him.  The Turkish president dismissed Bolton's calls for protection of the YPG Syrian Kurdish militia as a precondition to a U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria.
<br><br>
In a speech to the Turkish parliament, the president said, "Bolton has made a serious mistake and whoever thinks like this has also made a mistake."
<br><br>
The YPG is a crucial ally in Washington's war against the Islamic State group, but is considers by Ankara as a terrorist group linked to an insurgency inside Turkey.
