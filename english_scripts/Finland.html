   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Keith, I was surprised to hear that you actually lived in Finland.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keith:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I lived in a small
  <span class="audiodef">
   farm town
  </span>
  there. There&#39;s a little place called Kalhaba. About 8,000 people live there. Yeah, it was a nice time. I was teaching
  <span class="audiodef">
   kindergarten
  </span>
  to little Finnish children and sometimes I was teaching adults too. Once a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What was the best thing about Finland?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keith:
  </strong>
  Wow. I&#39;d say the summers were the best thing because summer&#39;s there, well, there&#39;s no night really,
  <span class="audiodef">
   depending
  </span>
  on where you are in the country. 24 hours of
  <span class="audiodef">
   daylight
  </span>
  if you were in lapland. It was
  <span class="audiodef">
   outstanding

  Todd:
 </strong>
 Mariel, you are from Finland.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah. Yes, I am.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What city are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  I live in a city called Espoo, which is right next to Helsinki, but I was born in the center of Finland in a place called Jyvaskyla.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right in the middle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   pretty much
  </span>
  right in the middle.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  So is that way out in nature in the forest, or is it a big city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   reasonable size
  </span>
  city, maybe the fifth largest in Finland, but it is very, a very natural place still. It&#39;s surrounded by lakes and forests and lots of cliffs and really beautiful scenery. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, that sounds nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah, I love it there. I go back there every year to visit my hometown.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now does your family still live in your hometown?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel
  </strong>
  : No, they live down south near Helsinki.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, is that common? Everybody moves to the big city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Pretty much, yeah. Especially young people. They want to get jobs and go to schools near Helsinki. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now is Finland part of the European Union?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yes, it is since 1995.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so because it&#39;s part of the European Union do a lot of young people decide to leave Finland and go live in other countries?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  The Finnish young people are actually very outgoing and they&#39;re very interested foreign cultures so a lot of people take a year or two just to travel, just to see the world, visit some places, and yeah, a lot of people go out to other countries to study as well.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Yep
  </span>
  , mainly Europe but also a lot of my friends for example went to India for six months or to South America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Sounds fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But because you&#39;re in the European Union you can go live in France or Germany or Spain if you want, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yeah. It&#39;s very easy. Just go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But do most Finnish people prefer to stay in Finland or do a lot of people like to go move to warmer climates?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Finnish people are very
  <span class="audionotes">
   patriotic
  </span>
  . We really love our country. We like to visit other places but I think even if we live abroad for a long time most people always some back to Finland. I think especially if they want to have a family because Finland is a very safe place and it&#39;s very good to
  <span class="audionotes">
   raise your kids
  </span>
  in Finland.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sounds like a nice place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think so. You should come and visit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I&#39;d love to.
