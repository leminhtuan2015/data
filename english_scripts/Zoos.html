 <strong>
  Jake:
 </strong>
 Hey, Lindsay, would you like to go with me to the zoo this Saturday?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  The zoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s gonna be lot&#39;s of fun. We&#39;re going to see lions and tigers and bears.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, my? Actually, I don&#39;t really like the zoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Why not. I thought everyone liked the zoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s natural for the animals to be in a cage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I can see your point but on the other hand, zoos often rescue the animals in the wild that couldn&#39;t survive on their own, and I hear that zoos often take very good care of the animals and they have an even longer
  <span class="audionotes">
   life expectancy
  </span>
  than they would have in the wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I agree with you. I think the animals do live longer in the zoo, but my problem is more the fact that it&#39;s just not natural. For example, I once saw a polar bear in California. A polar bear should not be in a warm climate. It should be in a cold climate where there&#39;s snow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  OK,
  <span class="audionotes">
   you got me there
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yes, I think I did. But I understand your point that zoos could be good, especially for the animals and the fact that they rescue the animals. I mean, that&#39;s nice. But, I think that you know, animals should die in the wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, I think it&#39;s better that they&#39;re alive so that people can enjoy them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  So you think the purpose of animals is for them to be enjoyed?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  No, no, but it&#39;s really interesting for us to be able to learn about the animals and
  <span class="audionotes">
   see them in person
  </span>
  instead of just on TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  I guess I agree with you, but I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t really think the purpose of the animals are for our pleasure. I think animals should be out in the wild living freely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  OK, are you opposed to circuses too?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, absolutely. I think they&#39;re very
  <span class="audionotes">
   cruel to animals
  </span>
  . Animals should not be there performing and living in close quarters and not being able to move around freely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, I can see your point but I still think zoos and circuses are a lot of fun and I like to go to them a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  OK, I guess we&#39;ll just have to disagree a lot of this one. Have fun at the zoo Jake.
