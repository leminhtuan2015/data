 <strong>
  Jana:
 </strong>
 I didn&#39;t know you were into dancing.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Well, yeah, just a little bit I guess. I used to go dancing quite a bit. I was part of this group of friends and we used to follow the rave scene in South Africa.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  And we used to actually go on these trance parties and there was a small dance or actually a music company that organized these events and they were all outdoor events and some of them would last a whole weekend so you would pack your camping gear and this dance would be or this trance party would be held outside, out in a forest or somewhere in the mountains or on a beach sometimes and these would sometimes
  <span class="audiolink">
   last
  </span>
  into the next day and the following day. People would come and go and the music would be non-stop basically.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Wow, so would you go every week or...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  No, not every week that&#39;s too much I think. It&#39;s too energy costing but it was so much fun really because it&#39;s just such a break from normal work routine and you get out into nature and it&#39;s the just the music and it&#39;s just nature. If you wanted you know to take a break you could
  <span class="audionotes">
   wander off
  </span>
  and find a quiet spot to rest and be with friends and eat something and relax and sleep maybe and then wake up and slowly join the party again and just
  <span class="audionotes">
   carry on
  </span>
  .
  <span class="audionotes">
   People of all walks of life
  </span>
  would come and join. Like professional people that wanted to
  <span class="audionotes">
   break out
  </span>
  or people that are kind of part of the hippy scene. I guess it was still going in some ways so yeah they would just
  <span class="audionotes">
   drift in and out
  </span>
  . It was really a lot of fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  That sounds fun and what kind of music would they play?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Mostly trance music so people that liked trance music would be, yeah, they would really go but the music, I don&#39;t know if you know trance music?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Not really, not that familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  It varies. There&#39;s a lot of, of course most of it&#39;s electronically based, so DJs would be able to control the tempo of the music and at some points the music would shift and change and like usually through the night there would be a different kind of phases of the music and DJs would take over and take over from each other so the music would change and the influences that they bring to the music would also change. Yeah, yeah, it&#39;s really, really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  It sounds really interesting. I&#39;ve never been to that kind of party so it&#39;s very different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  It was good. People would come, there would be little food stalls and some people would even bring their kids or whatever. It was very open, very friendly and people basically did what they wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  So it&#39;s like a music festival.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess you could say that a little bit. Yeah, yeah.
