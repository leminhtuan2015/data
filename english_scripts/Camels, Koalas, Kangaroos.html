   Todd:
  </strong>
  Rebecca, I&#39;m a huge animal lover. I love animals and Australia has lots of wildlife and animals. I was wondering, could you talk about them and starting with,
  <span class="audionotes">
   what&#39;s the deal
  </span>
  with the camels? Why do you have camels?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Camels are not really Australian animals but Australia&#39;s really big. It has a lot of desert in the center part of Australia so when white people first arrived in Australia, they decided to explore inland and because it&#39;s so dry, there&#39;s no water, the couldn&#39;t use horses so they brought camels over, but some got away and they went wild and they started breeding and now there&#39;s hundreds, maybe thousands, of camels
  <span class="audionotes">
   running around wild
  </span>
  in the desert.
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, way, really. So these camels are just free to do whatever, like, do people try to catch them or just let them be or what&#39;s the deal?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  As far as I know they have no jobs, no obligations. I think they can just do what they want. No, but in the northern part of Australia, actually they have a famous camel race every year, and it&#39;s like a horse race but with camels. That&#39;s pretty funny.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool. That would be cool to see. OK, I got to ask about the Koala. Now I heard that the Koala actually is not such
  <span class="audionotes">
   a cute creature
  </span>
  . That it has sharp claws and this and that. Is that true?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, something I could never really understand is why tourists want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   cuddle
  </span>
  a koala. I&#39;ve never cuddled one and I don&#39;t want to because I&#39;ve heard that they don&#39;t smell very nice. They&#39;re a little bit, not very friendly. Yes, they do have sharp claws and they can hurt you if they choose to. I think they genuinely are pretty peaceful, but I think they would rather sleep so.
 </p>

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and could the same be said for the kangaroo? So the kangaroo, are they these fun loving creatures or are they kind of wild and dangerous?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Kangaroos are definitely wild and dangerous. I think wallabies are safer. They&#39;re smaller and usually more friendly with people. You do have to be careful especially with male kangaroos. When I was a kid I tried to feed a kangaroo but the kangaroo got a little bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   over-excited
  </span>
  about my sandwich and he pushed me over and he stole my sandwich.
 </p>

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man. Whoa. Cool. Well, it&#39;s kind of cool that a kangaroo has an attitude.
