   Todd
  </strong>
  : So Meg, you are talking about being in the military, and you said you were a medic. Can you explain what that is?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So a medic, which now I believe is called health care specialist, is – I always say it&#39;s kind of similar to being like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   paramedic
  </span>
  where it&#39;s not a full nurse job. I think nurses have more training like in civilian side nurses, but similar to paramedic where you have certain, like,
  <span class="audionotes">
   minor procedures
  </span>
  that you&#39;re trained to do and high-level things than just an EMT like doing IVs and giving shots and stitches and things like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  And you&#39;re trained – because it&#39;s the military, you&#39;re especially trained for emergency situations, and how to treat someone who has maybe some serious life-threatening wounds. So that&#39;s a medic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. That sounds like a really difficult job. I mean, it&#39;s not your typical, just soldier job. You must have had a lot of schooling and education.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I had – well, everyone goes through the initial, about two and a half months like basic training. And that&#39;s more kind of basic combat skills and physical training that kind of thing. And then I had four months past that to train to be a medic. So we went through like emergency medical technician course just like civilian side. I got certified with that. And then we had additional training for the military skills like IVs and emergency procedures, that kind of thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. Can you explain what IV is?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : IV is an intravenous – like getting fluids into your body. So if you&#39;ve been injured and you&#39;ve lost a lot of blood or maybe you&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   dehydrated
  </span>
  and you need some fluid in your body quickly, then we stick a needle into your vein and then the fluids go in. And the needle comes back out but a little tube stays in. And then you can get fluids quickly that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So anybody that&#39;s been to the doctor knows that&#39;s always kind of the anxious moment when the nurse or the person who&#39;s going to stick the needle in. Were you good at doing that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So once I learned how to do it, I think I was pretty good. And I actually enjoyed doing it, not in a creepy way but, you know, it was – I guess, because I was decent at it that it was a part of my job that I enjoyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for myself, before we went through that training, I actually became dehydrated and needed to get an IV myself. And I was terrified because I really hadn&#39;t had that before in my life. And so, the nurse was going to come, you know, put the needle in my arm and I was like, &#34;No, isn&#39;t there another? I&#39;ll just drink a lot of water.&#34; And she was saying, &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to be a medic.&#34; And I was like, &#34;Oh, I haven&#39;t trained yet. Don&#39;t do it.&#34; So yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s cool. Yeah. I was recently in the hospital and they had me
  <span class="audionotes">
   strapped up
  </span>
  for both blood and for the water, the intravenous drip. And it&#39;s annoying because you can&#39;t really move, like if you want to get up and walk anywhere, you&#39;re strapped with all these tubes. And it&#39;s not very convenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, yeah. Or at least you have to careful. When I was getting the IV, I didn&#39;t know that the needle doesn&#39;t stay in your arm. Now, for some things, it does. For blood, maybe it&#39;s different, I&#39;m not sure. But yeah, so I was trying to be so careful too but you still want it to go well so you don&#39;t want to move very much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. So what percentage of people would you say freak out when they get the needle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Probably 90% or 95%.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Even, you know, tough Army guys would come in and be – and
  <span class="audionotes">
   they&#39;d be like
  </span>
  , &#34;Oh, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m fine in a bit.&#34; &#34;Well, we need to give you an IV.&#34; And they&#39;d be like, &#34;Oh…&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. Yeah. Nobody likes that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So you transitioned. You were in the medical profession and then you moved to education. Why did you leave the medical profession for education?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah. That&#39;s interesting because I became a medic in the military because I thought after I – when I could continue college that I would be a nurse or a doctor. But my time serving as a medic helped me learn that that was not what I wanted to do for my career after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I definitely am glad that I had those skills and the things that I learned and was able to experience. But I had – English had kind of been
  <span class="audionotes">
   on the back burner
  </span>
  . And so then I said, &#34;Okay, let me revisit this,&#34; and it led to English education.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. Have you ever thought about being like an English specialist for people in the medical fields like teaching doctors and nurses?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I guess I haven&#39;t thought about that specifically. Sometimes I thought about going back to military. They do have something like English schools in the military. And so, I guess that would be related. Also it could be – yeah, so that would be interesting. Something to think about.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right. Great. Thanks, Meg.
