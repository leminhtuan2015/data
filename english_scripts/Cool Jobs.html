   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Tim, I&#39;m a teacher, but you can have many, many jobs in the world. If you could pick any job, what do you think would be a cool job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, to be honest, I think it would be pretty cool to be a fisherman.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Fisherman!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Believe it or not I really like the ocean. I like spending time in the ocean and I think if you go out on those boats and get away from the land, you really
  <span class="audionotes">
   get in touch with the sea
  </span>
  and I just think that you get to work with your hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Is it dangerous though?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Oh, it is dangerous. For sure.
  <span class="audionotes">
   You can hook yourself
  </span>
  . You can get caught in storms. It can be not so good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Do you get paid a lot of money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Not so much, but that is not necessarily so important. You know. You can work with nature. You can catch your own food. Provide for yourself and I think that&#39;s really rewarding. How about you? What do you think would be a cool job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I think I would like to be a writer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Why is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Because a movie star would be good, or a rock star but there is too much fame. Too many people always want to talk to you or want your autograph, but I think a writer, you are doing something you love without all that pressure or media coming after you and you can sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   make your own time
  </span>
  and do it where you like. You can write in the country in a cabin or you can write in the city anywhere you like so I think it is a very flexible rewarding job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you got to have the skill for it though. Do you think you have that skill?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;m a terrible writer, but if I could have my pick of jobs, I&#39;d like to be a writer. How about you? You would like to be a fisherman. Any other jobs you would like to be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Another job that I think might be cool is a fireman to tell you the truth. Again, you kind of working with nature. I&#39;d really like to be a sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   a slash and burn fireman
  </span>
  . Someone that goes out where there&#39;s wildfires, things like that, cause you&#39;re working with nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Those guys, the slash-and-burn fireman, they get to jump out of helicopters sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Some of them do yeah, but that&#39;s kind of the glamorous one. Yeah, I wouldn&#39;t mind just being the guy that&#39;s on the ground, and the nice thing about it is you work really, really hard and you get paid pretty well for the time you work but then you get a long time off.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  But, I&#39;m a little bit scared of fires. You don&#39;t mind fire?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t mind fire so much. You know. It&#39;s hot and it can be really, really dangerous but I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s kind of exciting and I like the idea of being out there in nature and just working hard to survive and working in a team. I think it would be good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I want to be an astronaut. I think an astronaut would be good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Why is that? It&#39;s a dangerous job. A fireman&#39;s dangerous but it sounds like and astronaut would be pretty dangerous as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  A little dangerous but I&#39;d like to go to the moon to see what&#39;s on the moon. I think it would be kind of neat to be on the moon and looking back at the earth. They call the earth the blue planet. I think
  <span class="audionotes">
   it would be neat
  </span>
  to sit up there and look back on the earth and it would be kind of neat I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Sounds like you like the ocean. You should think about being a fisherman.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  No way! No thanks.
 </p>
