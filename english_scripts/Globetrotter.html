  Jeff:
 </strong>
 So, Jonathan, what is home for you? Where is home for you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Where is home for me? Actually, I would have to say that I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   homeless
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Homeless! What do you mean homeless?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t call one particular place home. I pretty much live out of a suitcase. I don&#39;t have roots holding me to one particular place. I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   born and raised
  </span>
  in Toronto but from a very young age I was traveling for different purposes: some for the work that I was doing, some for just pleasure travel and even now when I go back to Toronto, it doesn&#39;t really feel like home. In fact people comment about my accent, and they say, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s an interesting accent. Where you are from?&#34; and I say, &#34;Well, I&#39;m from here.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So where do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   split most of the majority of your time
  </span>
  ? Where&#39;s your base?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t really have
  <span class="audionotes">
   a base
  </span>
  . That&#39;s the thing. I spend about four, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less, months in Japan and I usually visit my parents for about a month a year, sometimes in Canada where they spend spring, summer and early autumn, and sometimes in this small little town in Mexico that they like to go to avoid the harsh Canadian winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So, you and... in between those times, in between Mexico, in between Canada, in between Japan, where are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Wherever I sort of feel like going. Now I don&#39;t draw the kind of salary that allows me to live a glamourous lifestyle and travel around the world with
  <span class="audionotes">
   the jet set
  </span>
  , but I can certainly go and spend several months a year in different destinations, living a very basic existence but having enough time to be able to travel around and stay in
  <span class="audionotes">
   simple accommodation
  </span>
  , go out and hit the bars at night, talk to the people I meet in those different areas. At different times I have different interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So that sounds like a pretty exciting, pretty fun life. Do you ever get tired of it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  I think that it&#39;s the kind of life that doesn&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   appeal to everyone
  </span>
  and some people think I have this wonderful, fantastic life all the time. Sometimes, I would like to work a little bit more. Sometimes, I think, &#34;Oh, no! I have nothing to do for the next three months.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Except for travel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Yes. And as of now, this work that I&#39;m about to do finishes in a couple of days and people have asked me, where am I going afterwards and my honest answer is I don&#39;t know. I literally have no idea where I&#39;m going to be four or five days from now, and I have no idea what I&#39;ll be doing for the next three months until I need to be back in Japan for work three months from now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Well, good luck on your next trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Thank you.
 </p>
