 So Daniel, we&#39;re talking about emotions and let&#39;s talk about emotions in men. Do you think it&#39;s OK for men to cry?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Well, I do think it&#39;s all right. There&#39;s nothing wrong about it. If you want to cry, if you&#39;re sad, if you are angry, if you are disappointed, I think it&#39;s normal. The normal reaction would be to cry but unfortunately there is a huge
  <span class="audionotes">
   stigma
  </span>
  attached to men crying. For some people it is a big issue. For me, personally, it isn&#39;t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I agree a hundred per cent with you. For me personally, I think it&#39;s totally OK for guys to cry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Hm, hm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  But I think it&#39;s in my culture, Indonesian, it&#39;s really uncommon to, you know, for guys to show this emotional expression when they cry. For example when, even when you&#39;re little, if you cry in the classroom and when you are a guy and if you cry, people are just going to make fun of you and they&#39;re going to start laughing and
  <span class="audionotes">
   calling you names
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I know totally. It&#39;s the same in Chile actually. Well, I was raised in a really, really strong kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   macho
  </span>
  culture. I mean crying was a sign of weakness so boys were not, I mean I can say, were not allowed to cry, right, because of, because of the whole macho thing and you have to be a man, you have to be brave so you&#39;re not supposed to cry. But now I think it&#39;s, kids shouldn&#39;t be, well they shouldn&#39;t be encouraged to cry but they should be told that it&#39;s all right. I mean it&#39;s a natural reaction and you have to show your feelings so I think if you want to cry, if you&#39;re sad and if you want to cry, you should just do it but there&#39;s nothing to be embarrassed about.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I think that&#39;s just how it is inside or they expect men to be macho and masculine and I think showing tears kind of takes away a lot of masculine, like
  <span class="audionotes">
   masculinity
  </span>
  out of men.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s more masculine just to assume that you are sad and you are showing it. You&#39;re not afraid to show your emotions. I think that&#39;s more valuable, that&#39;s more, I mean I&#39;m a boy and because I cry that doesn&#39;t make me
  <span class="audionotes">
   less of
  </span>
  <span class="audionotes">
   a man
  </span>
  . I mean, I&#39;m a man and therefore, I don&#39;t know because I&#39;m a man, I can show my expressions and I&#39;m not afraid of it. I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s what I think.
