  Valeria:
 </strong>
 You have to think in Buenos Aires in terms of day Buenos Aires and night Buenos Aires.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  They are like two cities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : What about the night?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  : Well, there are a lot of night life.
  <span class="audionotes">
   For instance
  </span>
  , you can go to a restaurant at eleven pm and everything is fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  : You can go to a pub from Monday to Monday. You can go to a disco from Monday to Monday. Of course Fridays and Saturdays are...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Are better obviously?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Of course, but still you can enjoy night life every day. Another that is very interesting, in terms of night life, is that cultural activities that are usually like in the day, but you can enjoy them at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  For instance, you can visit the Jard√ån Botanico, the
  <span class="audionotes">
   botanical garden
  </span>
  . Once per month they offer a kind of special night beside plants, flowers and the typical things of a botanical garden. You can find sculptures, and it&#39;s very interesting. Another thing that is a day visit, but there are some opportunities for visiting at night, is like the
  <span class="audionotes">
   cemetery
  </span>
  of the Recoleta.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ve heard that. I think it&#39;s really famous, but I don&#39;t know why.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Well, the thing is that it&#39;s very beautiful. I really like this place; it&#39;s one of my favorites. All the main
  <span class="audionotes">
   personalities
  </span>
  of the history of my country are there. It&#39;s very beautiful, because it&#39;s full of
  <span class="audionotes">
   sculptures
  </span>
  of famous artists so if you visit that place with a guide you will find, you will know the history of Argentina in an art museum.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : But it&#39;s...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  But it&#39;s a cemetery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : But at the same time it&#39;s a cemetery, an art museum, and kind of history lesson?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  OK, let&#39;s put it this way. You are in a cemetery, but it&#39;s like being in an art museum taking a lesson of Argentian history.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s brilliant. Thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
