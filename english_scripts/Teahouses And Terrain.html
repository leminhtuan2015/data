   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what&#39;s the best thing about hiking this Annapurna Trail? Like can you
  <span class="audionotes">
   describe
  </span>
  what you see and what you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  That Annapurna Himalaya Trek is quite unusually because it&#39;s a circular trek. One of very few in the world, so the
  <span class="audionotes">
   scenery
  </span>
  doesn&#39;t repeat. You don&#39;t have to pass the same thing twice. You start out from a much lower elevation and you&#39;re going through similar to tropical jungle type of
  <span class="audionotes">
   surroundings
  </span>
  and as you&#39;re slowly
  <span class="audionotes">
   ascending
  </span>
  you get up above the tree-line into the mountains and by the time you get over the Throngala Pass, which is well over 5,000 meters you&#39;re in a
  <span class="audionotes">
   winter wonderland
  </span>
  and surrounded by mountain peaks well over 6,000 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That sounds pretty cold and it&#39;s almost December. Do you have really warm clothing for this?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  You don&#39;t need to bring very warm clothes. When you&#39;re trekking during the day and the sun is out and you&#39;re getting a lot of exercise, you certainly don&#39;t feel cold. At night time, you&#39;re usually inside one of these little lodges, these teahouses where there&#39;s probably a fire going and perhaps you might put on some sort of fleece or light sweater that you carry with you to make sure you don&#39;t get too cold, and if you feel cold there&#39;s always an extra blanket you can get from the teahouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, sounds like a great time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  You should join.
