  Mike:
 </strong>
 Hey, MJ, I heard that herbal tea is good for your complexion?
 <p>
  <strong>
   MJ:
  </strong>
  Yes, I think so, cause recently I&#39;m drinking lots of herbal tea, and then face getting more white and smooth I think. It really helps on your
  <span class="audionotes">
   complexion
  </span>
  . Mike, you should try sometime.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Actually, for me it&#39;s the opposite. My skin&#39;s pretty dry right now, especially since summer is coming, and so I&#39;ve been using some kind of moisturizer but it doesn&#39;t really work that well so maybe I should take up the ... I should start drinking herbal tea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   MJ:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you should cause, a long time ago my face was kind of dry like you, but after drinking herbal tea, which my roommate recommended to me, and you really help your skin to be more bright and energetic. My skin no more dry. It&#39;s really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Other than tea, what about food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   MJ:
  </strong>
  I think garlic is really good for your complexion.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Oh, I heard about that as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   MJ:
  </strong>
  Yeah, most Korean girls, they have such good skin, especially on their face, I think because they&#39;re eating kimchi which the
  <span class="audionotes">
   main ingredient
  </span>
  is garlic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Right, that&#39;s a big problem for me because I don&#39;t like garlic. I don&#39;t mind it if it&#39;s fried with vegetables, but I don&#39;t like the
  <span class="audionotes">
   raw taste
  </span>
  of garlic. Garlic&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   out for
  </span>
  me, so are there any other stuff I can try?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   MJ:
  </strong>
  You know tomato? It is low calorie and it is a vegetable which tastes like fruit but is a vegetable that is really good for your complexion as well so if you like tomato, just try to take as many tomato as you can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Fresh tomato?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   MJ:
  </strong>
  Fresh tomato.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  What about like tomato based stuff like pasta? Is that OK or is that no?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   MJ:
  </strong>
  That is OK but when you cook the tomato, there are vitamins just goes away, so the fresh one is better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Fresh stuff. OK. OK, I got that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   MJ:
  </strong>
  By the way, what about Singapore? Like do girls eat special food for their skin?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Good question. I don&#39;t know that much, but there&#39;s always this thing about eating tofu and for my dad, he doesn&#39;t even cook it. He eats it like ... he just eats tofu without cooking it. And my dad has great complexion. My mom, she drinks a combination of Bali Green. It&#39;s just a green
  <span class="audionotes">
   substance
  </span>
  from the bali plant, and she basically blends them together with garlic and one other fruit, and a little bit of honey and apple cider, so it&#39;s just a few ingredients together and then she mixes it with juice and she drinks it like every morning, but I&#39;ve tried it but I don&#39;t like raw garlic so I couldn&#39;t stomach that, but my mom&#39;s complexion is good, but these are not only good for your complexion, this is just good for overall health.
