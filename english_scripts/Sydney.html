   I really liked living in Australia. I was an international student and I studied education at the University of Sydney. Lliving in Sydney was fantastic becuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great
   <span class="audionotes">
    nightlife
   </span>
   in Sydney. There are lots of great clubs. People were very, very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people  living in Sydney.

   I travelled a little bit in Australia. I went up the east coast, up to Frasier Island which is a world heritage site.  I saw dingos running along the beach and sharks in the water. We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the West Indies, which is a bit further north. The further north you go in Australia, the hotter it gets. We were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit
   <span class="audionotes">
    risky
   </span>
   because I didn&#39;t have a
   <span class="audionotes">
    diving license.
   </span>
   I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really  spongy purple inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly.

   Almost. Ah, you&#39;re lucky. It&#39;s funny, you go in the water and you worry about sharks
                                          but not

   I&#39;d like to go and live there for at least another year. Probably I&#39;ll go back to Sydney or I may go down to Melbourne because it&#39;s a really interesting cultural city. They have lot of museums and parks.
