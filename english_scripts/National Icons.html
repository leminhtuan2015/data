  Fanny:
 </strong>
 Brian, my last question seems too serious.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  It was. It was a very academic kind of question.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   You&#39;re testing me Fanny
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Sorry for that. I would also like to ask you some funny questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  OK,
  <span class="audionotes">
   hit me
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Have you ever seen a polar bear?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Have I seen a polar bear? Unfortunately, I have not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  No, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  I think you need to go really far to the north.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  North. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Like, up around, like the North Pole maybe because I think the polar bears live like only on the ice, and this is like really far from any kind of like, you know, city or civilization, and I&#39;ve never been up to like such a remote kind of place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  OK, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Unfortunately no polar bears. I&#39;ve seen other bears, but no polar bears.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  OK, me either.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  No polar bears in China?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cold enough to have polar bear there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  How about Panda? I&#39;ve heard there are some Pandas in China.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I saw Panda for several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   In the wild
  </span>
  or in a zoo?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  In the zoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  And on TV. I just joking. I just saw some pandas by myself in the zoos, but I don&#39;t think they are the, you know, how do you say, because I think in the wild we can see the Pandas. We can see their activities more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   How should I put that
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s more natural maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Natural, yeah. It&#39;s very natural, but in the, you know, in the zoos the pandas are always sleeping. They&#39;re... or they&#39;re just eating something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Lazy animals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  No, the cannot do some, you know, outdoor activities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Poor pandas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   It&#39;s a shame
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is.
