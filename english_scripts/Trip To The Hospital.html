   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Hey, Ian, tell me about the time you were at the hospital.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ian:
  </strong>
  What, the first time I went to the hospital?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Yes, the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ian:
  </strong>
  The first time I went to hospital was when I was 13 years old and it was the day of my birthday and I had a pain in my right side and I&#39;d been sick the day before and so on my birthday my mom phoned the hospital and the doctor decided I should go to hospital and I had my appendix out
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  OW! That sounds painful!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ian:
  </strong>
  Mm, but there&#39;s more! On my 18th birthday, I had like a lump in my throat, and I couldn&#39;t breathe properly and again my mother phoned the doctors and I went to the hospital again and my right lung had collapsed
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, my goodness!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ian:
  </strong>
  I know. I spent about 8 days in hospital and it was is Wales. I always remember being in Wales because I had problems understanding the doctor&#39;s accent, and then, are you ready, there&#39;s more
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Tell me
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ian:
  </strong>
  Again when I was 20 years old I was at university in Leeds, and again I had a lump in my throat and I had problems breathing. I went to the hospital and the same thing again. My right lung had collapsed
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Collapsed!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ian:
  </strong>
  Yes, but this time, because we were in a big city, they had more sophisticated medical equipment and they put a syringe, made a very small hole in my chest and put the syringe into my lung and drained away the excess air and my lung was inflated again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Did it hurt?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ian:
  </strong>
  Not as much as the first time. And I only spent a day in hospital and then they sent me home, but there&#39;s more. A week later I had the same problem, a lump in my throat, and I had problems breathing and so I went to the hospital again and my right lung had collapsed again, for the third time, so this time the
  <br>
  doctors decided they had to do a bigger operation to make sure that this wouldn&#39;t happen again so I was
  <br>
  at hospital for two weeks and they cut away the top part of my lung, and stitched me back up and now my lungs are absolutely fine. I&#39;ve had no problems since and I&#39;m doing lots of running and I feel much better,
  <br>
  but I don&#39;t want to have the same thing again. Ever!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I hope you don&#39;t either. That&#39;s amazing!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ian:
  </strong>
  I know. The thing is, my uncle and my father had the same problems so it&#39;s probably in my genes, in my families genes, that we have this. It&#39;s a common family problem, but anyway, now I am OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s good!
  <br>
