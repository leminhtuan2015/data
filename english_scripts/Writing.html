   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK., Jeff, you&#39;re a writer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  A little bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Hobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Talk about writing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I write. I think you writers write about what they know. So, and I don&#39;t know much so....so it&#39;s difficult. Difficult to be a writer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, writers write about what they know so I&#39;m writing. I have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   manuscript
  </span>
  now about travelling, the people, the people I&#39;ve
  <span class="audionotes">
   come in contact with
  </span>
  and what I thought about then. In the situation we&#39;ve been in when we&#39;ve met, sort of thing. But it&#39;s difficult, it&#39;s not easy-- It&#39;s not an easy thing to do. At first I did sort of thinking, anyone could do it almost if you
  <span class="audionotes">
   put the time into
  </span>
  it but now I think it&#39;s very difficult. You have to be creative and it&#39;s a lot harder than I think it seems. To pick up a finished product, a book. A
  <span class="audionotes">
   physical book
  </span>
  or to take a book from the library, I think it&#39;s-- you
  <span class="audionotes">
   underestimate
  </span>
  the work and the time that has gone into it. It&#39;s a long, lot of effort behind it. So..it&#39;s fun, I like it but it&#39;s very difficult. But it&#39;s good.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, John, you were saying that you taught writing in America
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and you said it was a paperless class.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Paperless class
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what does that mean, a paperless class?

  Basically, it means that we didn&#39;t use paper. Right, there was no paper. All of the students&#39; assignments were posted on a web page, so for each of their papers that they had to write, each of their essays, they could just go online and read the description of the assignment and all their requirements, and then they had two options for handing in their essays; they could either type them up and e-mail them to me or they could type them up directly in like a text format screen on the web, so that I could, I would do all of the grading for the papers like online.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, did you like it as a teacher?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  It was a bit difficult cause it takes a lot to get used to reading everything on the screen, and it&#39;s, actually as far as like marking papers and grading them, it&#39;s easier for you because you can just highlight something and make it red and be like, you know, red needs spelling
  <strong>
  </strong>
  or whatever, and it&#39;s much quicker than like circling it and writing &#34;spelling&#34; once you get in the habit of doing it with the mouse and have your color skeem worked out, it goes very quick, and if you want to do a comment you can just, you know, change the font or the size, and type directly in the text, and they know, &#34;oh well, here&#39;s John&#39;s comment.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did the student like it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Most of the students liked it, but there was a small majority that, you know, usually when they were late, or whenever they wanted to just like slip a paper under my door, and they couldn&#39;t do that, because you know they would, I would know if their paper was late because you know, it wasn&#39;t, the computer doesn&#39;t lie. It was logged in at this time and you know sent to me, so &#34;yes it was late!&#34; They couldn&#39;t, you know get around that kind of paper trail.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you&#39;re a writer, do you think it actually helps students to do this stuff on computers or should you go back to the pencil paper method?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  I think it is important to be able to do both. I think that&#39;s the most important thing about being a writer is being able to be versatile and go in different directions and write in different forms, but probably as far as tools go these days, it&#39;s more important for students to be able to compose on a computer, because most likely that is what they&#39;ll be doing most of their writing.
