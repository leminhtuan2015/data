  Fred:
 </strong>
 Hi, Anja. So, you&#39;re from Switzerland, right?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, I am.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Oh, I was wondering because I was reading recently and I was wondering what were the traditions of Santa Claus in Switzerland?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, they are
  <span class="audionotes">
   quite different
  </span>
  I guess from the rest of like America or Canada, because in fact we don&#39;t have Santa Claus bringing the Christmas, the presents, on Christmas.

  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  You don&#39;t have a Santa Claus bringing presents?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s right. Like, we do have Santa Claus but he&#39;s coming on the sixth of December.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  The Sixth of December! But us it&#39;s the 25th of December.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow, that&#39;s really different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yeah, indeed. Like Santa Claus will bring you presents but it&#39;s more like little like presents of nuts or mandarins, or little chocolates.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  So he&#39;s bringing fruits for Christmas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Because, you know, Santa Claus, he&#39;s living in the forest so he....
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Wait, wait, wait! Santa Claus lives in the forest. He doesn&#39;t live in the North Pole?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s right. He lives in the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Wow. OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  With his
  <span class="audionotes">
   little fellow
  </span>
  that helps him, you know, collect all the fruits and nuts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Are they elves?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  No, no. It&#39;s just one guy, his friend, and it&#39;s a little bit difficult to say the name. You won&#39;t understand it. With him as his donkey. There&#39;s a donkey too. It helps him carry all the presents for the kids, so he will just come to the people&#39;s houses and ring a bell, and so, &#34;I&#39;m here.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  He rings the bell?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  And he enters from the front door and then gives the gifts...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Oh, he doesn&#39;t go through the
  <span class="audionotes">
   chimney
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  No, oh, yeah, that&#39;s right. He just enters the door like, the parents open the door, like, &#34;Please come in&#34; and the kids are usually hiding because they are really scared of Santa Claus. Oh, and one more thing, it&#39;s quite different, but like the Santa Claus, it&#39;s kind of a
  <span class="audionotes">
   scary person
  </span>
  because if you&#39;re actually bad, it&#39;s not only that you won&#39;t get presents, but he will also put you in a bag and take you away to the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Santa Claus will put the in kids the bag?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  And then take them away?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, if you were a bad boy or a bad girl he will do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Wow, that is something very different from our tradition in Canada. So who is the person that brings the presents on Christmas day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s a good point. Like we have an angel coming down from the heaven and bringing all the presents, actually, someone during the...
  <span class="audionotes">
   at one point
  </span>
  during the night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  An angel brings the presents on Christmas day and not Santa Claus, wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m very surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
