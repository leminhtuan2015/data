   Jessica:
  </strong>
  So Kate what is, what&#39;s this future trip? What are you gonna do next year?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Next year, so when I leave Japan, I&#39;m going back to Australia to work for another 8 weeks
  <strong>
  </strong>
  and then I&#39;m off to New Zealand to see the rest of New Zealand and then Fiji and then, and then it&#39;d be nice there cause I get to spend some time lying on the beach and then go to the Cook Islands.
 </p>

  </strong>
  After the Cook Islands I&#39;m going to go and see my best friend. She lives in Kuala Lumpur, so I&#39;m going to go and do the East Coast of Malaysia and then I&#39;m gonna go to Thailand and the Cambodia and then Vietnam and Lao and then India, and that&#39;s as far as I got.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  OK, so after that point you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re gonna go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m gonna go. Probably, probably I&#39;m gonna head towards Canada because one of my best friend&#39;s immigrated there so I&#39;d like to see him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Wow, so how long do you think you&#39;re going to be traveling for then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Three years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  For three years. Wow, so now, do you have, like a plan after that or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kate:
  </strong>
  Yeah, after I finish my travels I&#39;m going to go back home and I&#39;ve just finished my Master&#39;s before I came up, so I&#39;m going to go back and do my PhD. in Psychology and then I&#39;m going to train to be a psychologist.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Wonderful. Great. Well thanks Kate.
