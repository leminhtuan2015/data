   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Shawn you&#39;re a big guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shawn:
  </strong>
  Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you play rugby?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shawn:
  </strong>
  I did in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, how does rugby work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shawn:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a bit like American football and soccer put together. It&#39;s, the ball&#39;s about the size of an American football, but the game, in American football you pass forward, but in rugby you pass backwards. Games are a bit shorter. Their 80 minutes long. Less stopages than American football, but like soccer it&#39;s continuous play,
  <em>
   how-should-I-say
  </em>
  , it&#39;s a physically demanding sport, probably the one of the most physically demanding sports in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so you say it&#39;s physically demanding. How is it physically demanding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shawn:
  </strong>
  You have to be extremely strong, but at the same time, you have to have,
  <em>
   wha-chu-call
  </em>
  , an extreme line on stamina to play this sport. Without stamina, you can not continue in this sport.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, just some people may not know, what is stamina?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shawn:
  </strong>
  You have to be able to run for 80 minutes in the game. Besides the game rugby has a bit of it&#39;s own culture. A bit of a cult in the world. It&#39;s a very small following but people do follow it, follow it very devoutly, very seriously, and it,
  <em>
   how-should-I-say
  </em>
  , I can honsestly say rugby has been a big part in changing me into the person that I am presently.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh. How so?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shawn:
  </strong>
  Sort of, how I can develop my leadership skills, my social skills, and how to work as a team player, in such a,
  <em>
   how-should-I-say
  </em>
  , in that time when you do play rugby, it&#39;s so aggressive, and it teaches you how to be a leader in tight situations, and it shows how you can truly push yourself to the limit, and not go,
  <em>
   how-should-I-say
  </em>
  , not go over the limit.

  OK, Kevin, I hear that you&#39;re from Wales.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yes, I&#39;m from Wales.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you&#39;re really into rugby!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I love rugby. Um, in Wales everybody plays rugby, in primary school, in juniorhigh school we play rugby. When I was in high school everybody in my high school had to play rugby. All the boys had to play rugby. And it&#39;s our national sport.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Uh, do you still play now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Ah, I played about five years ago. I played in Japan in Kobe. The club was called Kobe Regata club.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  And they were very strong. Yeah, but in this country you play on sand, but in Wales you play on grass. It&#39;s a lot easier to play rugby in Wales.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Um, What&#39;s the best thing about rugby?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Violence. Ah, it&#39;s very good because you can run and you can hit somebody and you don&#39;t go to jail for doing it so...it&#39;s the same as if you&#39;ve been to America, the same as American football. Uh, it&#39;s very strong and when you practice you become stronger. You&#39;re body becomes stronger and it&#39;s just fun to play rugby.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Have you ever broken a bone or...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve broken my nose, I&#39;ve had about ten stitches in my bottom lip. Ah, I&#39;ve broken a finger. That&#39;s not too bad. Many of my friends have broken their legs and knees... and problems but not too bad for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Great. Thanks a lot Kevin.
