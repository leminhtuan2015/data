  It was interesting as well while we were out on the farm, there were thousands of trees I think out on the farm, so we saw lots of different insects and little animals as well. The most exciting thing I saw was a red back spider, because the red back is one of the most
  <span class="audiodef">
   poisonous
  </span>
  spiders in Australia. So I had been traveling there for over a year I think
  <span class="audiodef">
   at that stage
  </span>
  and I&#39;d never seen a red back spider, but I&#39;d seen lots of colorful spiders, so that every time I saw a new colored spider I&#39;d go and have a look and maybe play with it a bit or take a photo, something like that, so while I was picking the macadamia nuts with my friends I saw a really brightly colored spider, so I decided to, to get a stick and and kind of turn over a leaf and see what it was doing, and then I was kind of looking at it for awhile and then suddenly I realized, &#34;Oh, my God!&#34; It&#39;s red and black, it&#39;s a red back spider!&#34; So I thought, OK, I&#39;d better stop playing with this
  <span class="audiodef">
   guy
  </span>
  , and
  <span class="audiodef">
   leave him alone
  </span>
  . So after over a year in Australia I saw my first red back on this macadamia farm and then later on that night, just before I was going to bed, I walked into the room I was staying in with my friend, and there on my bed was baby redneck spider, red back spider, sorry and I couldn&#39;t believe it. After one year, no red backs and then two in one day. It was a bit crazy really so I had to get someone to help me to
  <span class="audiodef">
   get rid of it
  </span>
  , cause it was a bit scary.
