  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So Meg, in the last one we were talking about idioms, but we didn&#39;t cover them all. Let&#39;s go over some more idioms.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Alright so the first one is what activity is
  <span class="audionotes">
   in your blood
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hmm, I would say anything with nature in my blood, so hiking or especially kayaking. I love going kayaking, and so it&#39;s hard for me to resist if I&#39;m in a place with beautiful nature, I need to go outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So what about baking? Isn&#39;t baking sort of just natural for you. Don&#39;t you just love to bake? Isn&#39;t it in your blood?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I do also love to bake. Yeah. I guess hiking and baking are both in my blood together, kind of two different activities. So baking especially when I can make very creative and decorative desserts, to share with people, so I don&#39;t like to bake for myself, but sharing with others, it&#39;s quite enjoyable for me. Do you have any activities or things that are in your blood?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, I think one is just teaching. I love teaching. I just want to teach all the time. Even if I won the lottery, I would be a teacher. I just like thinking of lessons, thinking of new ideas for lessons, trying technology with lessons, so even on my free time, I like thinking about it. And another thing is jogging. Even though, most people are surprised because I&#39;m a little fat. I&#39;m about 20 pounds overweight, but I run almost every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I think I&#39;ve seen you running before.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I literally run every day. Like if I don&#39;t run, I feel terrible, like it&#39;s the most relaxing thing for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I can&#39;t go two or three days - two days maybe - but I can&#39;t go three or four days without running.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So jogging is really in your blood?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, and I started when I was a kid. You know the movie Forest Gump, where he just starts running.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Right, yes, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That was me as a kid.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Run Forest Run!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I would just run out of my driveway, also in the country, and just go running for an hour
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Just to run, I thought it was fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Well, that&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it&#39;s definitely in my blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK, so we&#39;ll talk a little about feelings. So when you get criticized, do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   take it to heart
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I think my first reaction, is to take it to heart, so sometimes I might be a little oversensitive when I first get criticized, but after some time passes and I&#39;m able to think about it, usually I can see how that criticism can be useful, and I can try to make a change or improve something. Or I can decide that I don&#39;t care about that person&#39;s opinion. What about you? What do you do? How do you respond?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I used to take things to heart a lot, but as I&#39;ve gotten older, as many people do, now a lot of it just rolls off my back, as we say, like
  <span class="audionotes">
   water off a duck&#39;s back
  </span>
  , so it doesn&#39;t bother me at all
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I just realize everybody has different opinions and don&#39;t worry about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I think that&#39;s a good attitude to have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, OK, so the next one also about feelings and opinions. So are you more likely to
  <span class="audionotes">
   bite your lip
  </span>
  , or
  <span class="audionotes">
   speak your mind
  </span>
  when you disagree with somebody?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I think it depends on the situation, so if I feel like someone else is being treated unfairly or there are some rules that are there for a reason that should be followed, I am ore likely to speak my mind, but if it&#39;s something personal, or just related to me I might bite my lip to try to keep the peace. What would you do, bite your lip or speak your mind?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, I have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   big mouth
  </span>
  , so no, I always speak my mind. So I have a really big mouth. I just never keep it inside. Yeah, it&#39;s really hard for me to bite my lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, so. That can be a bad thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : But sometimes good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, say it like it is, as they say.
