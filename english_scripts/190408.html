Ugandan police said Sunday they have rescued an American woman and her driver who'd been kidnapped by gunmen in a national park.
<br><br>
On Twitter, police said the two "are in good health" and "in the safe hands" of security officials.  But that's all they're saying.
<br><br>
Ugandan security teams have been hunting down the gunmen who'd demanded a $500,000 ransom after kidnapping the American, a woman named Kim Endicott, and her Ugandan guide in a national part popular with tourists, the Queen Elizabeth National Park.
<br><br>
They were ambushed on April 2 in the park, a protected area near the porous border with Congo.
<br><br>
It remains unclear if a ransom was paid in the case of Endicott.

Appeal by the United Nations for a humanitarian cease-fire Sunday in the Libyan capital went largely unheeded as forces loyal to eastern Libyan military commander General Khalifa Haftar appeared to gain more ground against opposing militants and forces loyal to the national unity government of Prime Minister Fayez Al Sarraj.
<br><br>
Correspondent Edward Yeranian reports for VOA from Cairo.
<br><br>
Amateur video showed forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar defending their positions around Tripoli's international airport south in the city.
<br><br>
Arab media reported the airport closed since 2014 remained under Haftar's control but opposing Libyan forces are trying to recapture it.
<br><br>
Haftar's military spokesman, Colonel Ahmad Almismari, told Arab media that Libyan National Army Air Force planes launched four raids near the airport.
<br><br>
Arab media also showed residents of neighborhoods near the capital cheering as Haftar's forces entered.

A war monitor says shelling killed 13 civilians in northwest Syria on Sunday.  The violence is just the latest to threaten a seven-month-old truce intended to stave off a regime offensive on the region which is held by Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate.
<br><br>
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 30 civilians have been killed in regime attacks on Idlib since Wednesday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will annex some Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he wins Tuesday's election.  The move would mark a sharp departure from current Israeli policy.
<br><br>
Correspondent Linda Gradstein reports for VOA from Jerusalem.
<br><br>
In an interview with Israeli television, Benjamin Netanyahu promised to annex at least some Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
<br><br>
He said that every Jewish settlement in the West Bank is part of Israel, and he will not uproot one Jewish settler.  That is in contrast to his challenger, Benny Gantz, who has said he could move some Israelis from the West Bank in a peace deal with the Palestinians.
<br><br>
Netanyahu's remarks come two days before a closely fought Israeli election that could challenge Netanyahu's 10-year run in the prime minister's office.

Rwanda is marking the 25th anniversary of the worst genocide in recent memory.
<br><br>
The 100-day period of commemoration began Sunday with a ceremony and a speech from the nation's leader.
<br><br>
VOA's Esha Sarai reports.
<br><br>
Rwanda President Paul Kagame thanked survivors and commended the progress the country has made.
<br><br>
"In 1994, there was no hope, only darkness.  Today, light radiates from this place."
<br><br>
The commemoration began with the lighting of the flame and laying of wreaths at the Kigali Genocide memorial in the capital city of Kigali where close to 250,000 remains were buried.  In all, about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered by ethnic Hutu extremists during 100-day period in 1994.

Pakistan warned Sunday that its rival, India, is planning to launch a fresh military assault against the country, called for the international community's urgent diplomatic intervention to deter India from endangering regional peace and stability.
<br><br>
The Indian Foreign Ministry said in a statement "this public gimmick appears to be a call to Pakistan-based terrorists to undertake a terror attack in India."
