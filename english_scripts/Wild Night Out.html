  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  So Lupe, last night when we went out I saw you dancing with some guy. Who were you dancing with?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  I was actually dancing with *****, and I wish he would have not drank  so much, but it was still fun. Is he going tonight?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going. He has to work and I don&#39;t know if his brother is going to invite him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Cause he did mention last night that he was going, because last night
  <span class="audionotes">
   he had no cash in his wallet
  </span>
  and made me pay for him and promise that he would pay for me tonight, so I&#39;m really hoping that he does go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Well, if not, we&#39;ll have somebody else pay for you: his brother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  I just thought it was funny. Maybe that was his plan all along, to not go tonight so he really wasn&#39;t gonna pay for me and that&#39;s why he made me pay for him last night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Ah, maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Pretty good trick to play on girls. Yeah. Nowadays, you never know with these boys.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  So what happened at the end of the night? Where did he go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. He just kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   stormed off
  </span>
  . Took off. We couldn&#39;t find him. We checked in the restroom. We checked on the dance floor, at the bar.
  <span class="audionotes">
   He was nowhere to be found
  </span>
  and turns out he just left and started walking home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a long ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  It is a long ways. It probably took him an hour. If he even made it home. I&#39;m sure he called someone to go pick him up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  And drove him at least part way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Did Fermin tell you what happened or did he get off?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Fermin said that he tried to find him. He went to go pick him up but he wouldn&#39;t get in the car. He wanted to walk.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  And he actually walked all the way home?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. He said he showed up there later so I&#39;m assuming.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s a crazy boy, especially because it was really late at night and it&#39;s really dangerous to be walking out by yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  But
  <span class="audionotes">
   think of all the things we did
  </span>
  when we were twenty-one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  There was one time I remember you disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  I did but I didn&#39;t walk all the way home, especially in high-heels.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Oh, but you walked all the way to another hotel and nobody knew where you were at.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Actually, I got a cab. I walked for a little bit, and I knew
  <span class="audionotes">
   I wasn&#39;t gonna make it
  </span>
  so I did get a cab and go back to the hotel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  And I remember after, I was looking all over the club searching in the bathroom trying to figure out where you went.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  It was different though. I had way too many drinks, so I didn&#39;t realize I was there with you guys, or didn&#39;t think you guys would be so worried about me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Well, I knew you had too many drinks. I was afraid you were in the bathroom somewhere sick.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  No, and the bad thing was that didn&#39;t have my phone on me when I got back to the room because I was in the bathroom when you kept calling, and I know you guys were worried but I really didn&#39;t do that on purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  And you had the room key, and we were all locked out half the night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  But I heard you guys knocking, and I finally opened it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and hour later, when we finally woke you up along with half of our neighbors.

  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  So, now that we&#39;ve had my birthday and my party, what you would you like to do for yours?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s still a couple months away and I really did enjoy my birthday last year and the year before that, but my twenty-first birthday was by far the best when you organized my surprise party, cause I myself hadn&#39;t had a birthday party in probably ten years before that, so having another party would be absolutely awesome, but I know that it&#39;s a little bit harder now to get everyone together, so I think I&#39;d like to
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep the tradition going
  </span>
  and meet up at El Torito and have a few drinks, a few appetizers. Some cheese cake and then go out for some drinks and maybe a little bit of dancing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Well, on your twenty-first birthday we also went Disneyland in Anaheim. We can also do that again. I know that&#39;s one of your favorite places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Actually, it is. Disneyland is my favorite place to go, and my birthday does
  <span class="audionotes">
   land on
  </span>
  a Wednesday this year, so maybe the weekend before that, which happens to be a three day weekend because of
  <span class="audionotes">
   Memorial Day
  </span>
  , so that&#39;s a possibility. We could definitely go down to Southern California and have some fun down there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  And then, on your actual birthday, we could do the restaurant, drinks, appetizers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  We can. We could make it a week-long birthday. You know I always like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Yeah. And your birthday is in the middle of the week.
  <span class="audionotes">
   That&#39;s the best
  </span>
  , cause then you get to celebrate in the middle of the week and the weekend before and hopefully the weekend after.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Or if you want, we could even make it a birthday month like we have done before, so you know, we have our friend Alicia who does that. Maybe we can just follow her tradition. Make it a birthday month.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  If that is the case, then we would have birthday year cause cause we seem to do things every weekend throughout the whole year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true, but I was just saying to maybe focus more on the birthday girl.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I really wouldn&#39;t mind it,
  </span>
  especially for the whole month. Get a little extra attention, because, you know, I do like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Liar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;m serious. I think it&#39;s a great idea. And you can get me a little tiara, so what I can do the birthday princess. Make sure everybody knows that it&#39;s my birthday when we go out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Sounds like a plan.
 </p>
