  George:
 </strong>
 Hey, Crystal, I need some advice yo!
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s up, George?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  So, there&#39;s this like red-headed girl in class and
  <span class="audionotes">
   I kind of got a crush on her
  </span>
  but ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Oooh!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Uuurr! But, yeah, I don&#39;t know, you know, how to ask her out. I don&#39;t even know if she knows my name, but yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Ah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   come on
  </span>
  !
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  You got any advice?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  I would personally just be natural and just
  <span class="audionotes">
   go straight-forward
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Go straight-forward and ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  And ask her out?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  How I do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. For my personal advice I think you should just go straight forward and say &#34;Hi, my name is George&#34; and give her an appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Hold on. I&#39;m gonna write this down.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  OK. And next step is &#34;If you are free&#34; oh, you always have to check if she&#39;s either married, or if she&#39;s a lesbian, or if she is single.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  So, number three is what you&#39;re looking for.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  OK, number three.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  So, if she is single, just say, hey, how about we go out for a cup of coffee or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  OK, coffee.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  And, yeah, that&#39;s how you get her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  So, yeah, what if she doesn&#39;t like coffee though? I mean, what else could we do we on a date?
  <span class="audionotes">
   Assuming she will say yes
  </span>
  . What&#39;s fun to do on a date anyway?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Fun to do on a date! It&#39;s just the fact that you&#39;re being with her and just try to get to know her more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Wait, wait, wait one second. Do I need to pay for this?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think you should pay on the first date. I think sometimes that can be
  <span class="audionotes">
   offensive to women
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s great because I&#39;m totally broke.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  I think you should just ask her casually, not like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a date-date
  </span>
  , just say, &#34;Hey, I would like to know you a little bit more, and just go out for a small little drink, like go to that new cafe that&#39;s open, like a lot of girls think that place is so cute. I think you should take her there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  But I think cafe&#39;s are boring.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Cafe&#39;s are boring. Men! Women don&#39;t think so. This is the point. Write it down.
