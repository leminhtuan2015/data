   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Tres, can I ask you some questions about your hair?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  Sure, go ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you have
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/628-1-dreadlocks.mp3">
   dreadlocks
  </a>
  . How long have you had dreadlocks?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve had dreadlocks ever since I was in high school, so I would say over ten years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And how do you actually get dreadlocks, like what do you have to do to your hair?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  There are many ways you can get dreadlocks. One is to visit the salon and have it professionally done. Another way, the natural way, what I do is just
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/628-2-twist.mp3">
   twist
  </a>
  my hair and it takes maybe two or three months for the hair to actually lock together and become dreadlocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  Now because I am of African
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/628-3-heritage.mp3">
   heritage
  </a>
  my hair is different from my brothers and sisters who are of Asian or European heritage and therefore my hair locks much easier because it&#39;s curlier and it&#39;s quite flat.
 </p>

   Todd:
  </strong>
  So when you say you push it together to lock it, you just spend a little time every night just twisting your hair? (Yep)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  Yep.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How do you do it in the back though?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s really hard to describe with words but, it&#39;s a shoulder workout, but I just grab my hair, rub it in between my hands, sort of like when you&#39;re a kid and you&#39;re playing with
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/628-4-play-dough.mp3">
   play-dough
  </a>
  and you&#39;re trying to make a long cyclindrical rod with play-dough. You twist it in your hands. Same way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now once you have dreadlocks do you have to continually do this to keep them this way or once they are locked are they good forever?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  Once you have dreadlocks it is good to twist them occassionally because if you do not then they&#39;ll just grow out as if it&#39;s an afro, so I would have a large afro adn then at the tips of the afro I&#39;d have dreadlocks, so I do go back and twist my hair occassionaly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and for washing your hair, is there anything special that you have to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  Just make sure that you clean your scalp and whenever you choose a shampoo make sure that it&#39;s one that does not damage your scalp or what have you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so basically, nothing different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  Right. Nothing different, just watch out for the

   PH balance
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, thanks Tres.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
