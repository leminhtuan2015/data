   Yeah, he has. He came with me on my last vacation to New Zealand.

   It was quite funny actually because, he&#39;s, I&#39;m from New Zealand in the Western Country and I&#39;m from the country and he&#39;s from Africa and he&#39;s from the city so a lot of

     people assume that
    </a>
   </span>
   if your from Africa you&#39;re from the country and if you&#39;re from a Western Country, you&#39;re from the city and when he came to visit us I think he was a little bit shocked to end up in the middle of the country and my family thought he&#39;s be able to,
   <span class="style4">
    <a href="/NotesAudio0601/623-2-know-his-way-around.mp3">
     he&#39;d know his way around a spade
    </a>
   </span>
   and a shovel and and be able to plant trees which is what my parents spent a lot of time doing and so, I think in the beginning he was very, he was quite shocked about the type of lifestyle we had but after awhile he really settled in really well.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   What did you guys do on his trip to New Zealand?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   I taught him to swim. (Really) Kwame, well, he still can&#39;t swim very well. He can float, so we put actually, we, it&#39;s quite embarrassing, but we put a life jacket on him from, cause we have race boats, so we put a life jacket on him, and just sent him out into the water on his back
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would work.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   So we were quite shocked that he could&#39;t swim because coming from an island country, I have never before met anyone in my life that couldn&#39;t swim. I learned to swim when I was maybe 4 years old and we have swimming lessons at school so at least you don&#39;t go to school, there&#39;s no way that you can&#39;t swim.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So are you a good swimming teacher? Did you teach him successfully?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   <span class="style4">
    <a href="/NotesAudio0601/623-3-I-gave-up.mp3">
     I gave up halfway through it
    </a>
   </span>
   . My mom had to teach him because I&#39;m very small and my mom used to be a lifeguard so she, she was able to, cause Kwame is so big. He&#39;s over 6 foot, so and I&#39;m almost 5 foot so it&#39;s kind of a bit, a bit dangerous for me to be teaching him how to swim.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   What else do you remember about his first trip to New Zealand?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   Oh, gosh. I remember that my parents, they really, really loved him and my family spent the whole time fighting over who got to spend time with Kwame and I think that my parents want to
   <span class="style4">
    <a href="/NotesAudio0601/623-4-adopt.mp3">
     adopt
    </a>
   </span>
   me out and adopt Kwame instead. I really think they prefer him. He&#39;s the good son.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   What did Kwame think of New Zealand?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   He really liked it. He, my stepfather, he goes fishing all the time and Kwame, coming from the city, he, when my stepfather asked him to go fishing he kind of
   <span class="style4">
    <a href="/NotesAudio0601/623-5-squirm-at-the-thought.mp3">
     squirmed at the thought
    </a>
   </span>
   of the start, but after coming back fishing, he asked every night after that to go fishing (really) and now all he talks about is the large snapper that he caught in New Zealand.

   My mother, no, she doesn&#39;t. She used to work. In fact my mother and my father met at work. They both worked for Cathay Pacific, which is an airline based in Hong Kong. My mother was a stewardess and my father was a pilot, so they met that way in Osaka actually.

   How so?

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   I was the rebelious type. I pretty much laid the foundation for my sister to get all the freedoms that she has, and she doesn&#39;t appreciate any of the things I&#39;ve done so,.. another way that we&#39;re different is that she&#39;s really into arts and drawing and painting and making music where as I&#39;m more into the technical side of things, like I&#39;m into computer making, fixing cars.
