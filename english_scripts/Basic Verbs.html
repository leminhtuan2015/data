  : Hey, Shantel, what do you do on the weekend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : On the weekend, I wake up and, first, I make breakfast.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, what do you make?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : I like to make toast.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right. I often eat toast, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : Do you put butter on your toast?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I do. I put butter and jam.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  : Do you eat cereal?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : No. I used to, but not anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : On the weekend, I don&#39;t eat cereal. On the weekend, I cook a nice breakfast, but I eat cereal during the week. What else do you do on the weekend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : Let&#39;s see. After I eat breakfast, I clean the kitchen and make my bed. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I also clean my house. I clean my rooms. I vacuum. I wash the windows. I wash the dishes. I do my laundry. I do that on Saturday, but on Sunday, I have fun.

   Shantel
  </strong>
  : What do you do for fun?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I go to the park. I play sports. I play soccer at the park. Sometimes, I ride my bike. Sometimes, I go hiking. I do lots on Sunday. On Sunday, I relax. I don&#39;t study. I don&#39;t work, and I don&#39;t clean my house.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that sounds fun.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : Oh, Sunday evening, I relax. I cook a big dinner, and I listen to music, and, sometimes, I read my book, but, often, I go to sleep very early on Sunday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : And you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, on Sunday, I don&#39;t cook. I usually order food. I order pizza or maybe I eat at a restaurant, and then, later in the evening, on Sunday, I always watch TV. My favorite TV show is on Sunday night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : What&#39;s your favorite TV show?
 </p>
 <p>

  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  :  Nice. Maybe I should watch it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
