  Jess:
 </strong>
 Right, Tom, tell me, what three things could you not live without?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  Well, I guess you say me playing with my new toy just now. It&#39;s my iPod touch and it is fantastic. I often take long bus journeys at the weekend and on this little electronic storage machine with screen I can watch a movie and that&#39;s just ... makes bus journeys
  <span class="audionotes">
   fly by
  </span>
  . It also has wireless internet so I can carry it around and in a coffee shop I can check my e-mail and it has the added function of being able to play music, although I don&#39;t listen to music much. That&#39;s one. My iPod touch is with me all the time. It&#39;s kind of connected to my number 2. Number 2 is the internet.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I couldn&#39;t live without
  </span>
  the internet. I&#39;m online every day - reading newpapers, checking out information about things I want to do and see that day. Keeping in touch with family and friends, although I don&#39;t do that as much as they would like. The internet is such a huge part of my life.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I can&#39;t imagine
  </span>
  what it was like ten or fifteen years ago, when nobody was online. Number three, I suppose is the sun, which sounds a bit facile because everything on the whole planet requires the sun, but for me it&#39;s not so much about the nutrition that plants and animals derive from the sun. It&#39;s just being able to lie and relax in the soft warmth, tanning by the pool
  <span class="audionotes">
   letting my mind empty
  </span>
  and clear. Those are my three. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  Well, I have to agree with your second one, definitely the Internet is one thing couldn&#39;t live without either, for the same reasons you mentioned, really, just to stay in touch with people for things like reading the news, checking my e-mail, finding phone numbers, getting information. I really couldn&#39;t live without it. The second thing would be my family. I couldn&#39;t live without them. I think since I&#39;ve moved away from Britain and I don&#39;t live close to them, and I don&#39;t see them regularly anymore, I&#39;ve grown to love them even more. Kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   you don&#39;t realize what you&#39;ve until it&#39;s gone
  </span>
  , and that was true with my family. I really miss them all the time, and I love going back to see them, so they&#39;re my number two, and my number three would be music. Music&#39;s a huge part of my life and I think I remember things by what I was listening to at the time. I&#39;ll remember
  <span class="audionotes">
   periods of my life
  </span>
  by what&#39;s songs I was listening to or what album i bought, so for me my memories are very much brought back to me by music, so those are my three things: the Internet, my family, and music.
