   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, then we go back to the airport. I don&#39;t know what to do because I&#39;ll be back where I started and I see a hotel. A big hotel, right next to the airport and I tell the cab driver to go there, and so he goes and there&#39;s a bellman, you know, waiting for the cab. I go up and I get out of the cab and I&#39;m really sick and I just wasted three hours. I&#39;m back where I started.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  And you paid the man, like forty dollars and you didn&#39;t get where you wanted to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, and this is the interesting point. So we come back and the sweet old cab driver is there and he&#39;s trying to explain to the guy about how he couldn&#39;t find the place I guess, and he looks really
  <span class="audionotes">
   flustered
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  So then, I&#39;m thinking he wants more money so I pull out my wallet and and I give him another thousand baht. I put it in the cab driver&#39;s hand and he looks at it like it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a dead fish
  </span>
  , like doesn&#39;t want it. And he&#39;s just looking at it and looking at me and he has this really puzzled look, like he
  <span class="audionotes">
   doesn&#39;t get it
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  So finally the bellman kind of snaps at him in Thai, like you know, something and then the Thai cab driver takes the money and he walks back to the cab and he&#39;s looking back at me like like he feels guilty or he feels bad and he gets in the cab and he drives away.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then it dawned on me that the cab driver didn&#39;t want to take the money. Like he felt bad. He had been trying to find this place for three hours. He couldn&#39;t find it and he didn&#39;t even want the extra money, but I was just the foolish foreigner and didn&#39;t know what to do and the bellman said, just come on, you silly cab driver, take the money and go away.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I think it was a good story because I think that is so indicative of my time in Thailand, you know, like the people are so sweet and bad things can happen to you when you travel but in this story, it was just a sweet old guy and he actually didn&#39;t want to take anymore money from me. He didn&#39;t want to take advantage of me. He was just disappointed that he couldn&#39;t get me to where I wanted to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Did you actually get to the place you wanted to go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, yeah, eventually I called my friend and they came and
  <span class="audionotes">
   picked me up
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Was there a phone number on the card?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Why didn&#39;t you stop with the cab driver and call them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, because I was given the card and they said use this card to go to this place and it was a factory and then so when I called the place they realized what was happening. Before the cab driver was calling the place and so he couldn&#39;t find it but once there was a foreigner they put me with somebody who speaks English and it was
  <span class="audionotes">
   all worked out
  </span>
  , and I should have thought of that in the first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  You learn from experience.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know, Greg, you were talking about being lost in Thailand. I have my own story about being lost in Bangkok.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   supposed to
  </span>
  go and stay with some Thai friends in Thailand and I was coming from America and I had a business card, like you suggested and so I got in the cab and I just showed the guy the business card and he took off. And he was this really old taxi driver. Kind of a sweet guy but I didn&#39;t know anything about Thailand. And we get in the cab and in the cab he had this smell like an orchid flower or something and it was really strong and it was really making me sick.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Probably jasmine flower.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maybe yeah. That could have been it. And so we are driving and driving and we get out of the city and we&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   way out
  </span>
  in the countryside in like rice fields and things like that. Now, I&#39;ve only been in Thailand for about an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  And you&#39;re probably getting worried
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Thinking, maybe you are going to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get ripped off
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, like I&#39;m thinking, &#34;Oh, no!&#34; This guy&#39;s gonna take me somewhere and
  <span class="audionotes">
   take advantage
  </span>
  of me or he&#39;s lost and he doesn&#39;t know, and I&#39;m just getting really, really skeptical, so before we had left I had negotiated a price and I think I said I&#39;d pay him a thousand baht or something like forty dollars and he was very happy with the price.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a lot of money in Thailand,
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and I didn&#39;t know that. So this guy is driving here, driving there. He&#39;s stopping the cab. He&#39;s asking people. He can&#39;t find the business, so eventually,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m getting sick
  </span>
  cause of the flowers, it&#39;s been like three hours, we&#39;ve been driving around in the cab and I&#39;m worried that I don&#39;t have enough money for the cab fare. So I feel really, reallyy worried so I just tell the guy, &#34;back to the airport&#34; cause he doesn&#39;t know any English, and I don&#39;t know any Thai, so I just sort of communicate, &#34;back to the airport.&#34; The guy is like, &#34;Huh! Alright&#34;, so he takes me back.
