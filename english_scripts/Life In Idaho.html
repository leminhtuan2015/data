   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so we&#39;re here. Do you want to go ahead and introduce yourself to the listener?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  OK, my name is Hiroe Hashi. I&#39;ve lived in America for about seven and a half years. I lived in Italy for two years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! You lived in Italy too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Right, right. So all together I&#39;ve lived in a foreign country for nine and a half years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s amazing. So did you live in America before you lived in Italy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  I was in Italy when I was 9 years old, no actually 7 years old to 9 years old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did you learn Italian?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  A little bit. Basically
  <span class="audiodef">
   slangs
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, so then how old were you when you moved to America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I was 17. I was on a exchange program for when I went to Idaho.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, what did you think when you first got to America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  OK. I bought new clothing cause my image was like L.A., New York, but it was Idaho, but I didn&#39;t know what to
  <span class="audiodef">
   expect
  </span>
  , and I got of from the airplane and I said to myself, &#34;Oh, my god!&#34;. There was nothing there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so was it flat. Was it flat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  It was flat. I saw, There was...I remember the sun going down cause it was nothing, really nothing: a flat space, 360 degrees, an airport, cowboys.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cowboys!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Potatoes. Real Cowboys. Spuds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Idaho is cowboys and potatoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Exactly. That&#39;s all. About.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you still like potatoes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  I stopped eating spuds since I came back cause I ate it everyday. You go to 31 Ice-cream shop and there they have spuds ice-cream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. So spud means potato.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, spud, it&#39;s like Idaho English.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. And how about cowboys. Did you become a real cowboy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  I started to grow my hair, cause if you had short hair, people used to call you like a new-waver, like faggots. It was kind of a little disaster for somebody different to live.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, for sure, that would be really
  <span class="audiodef">
   harsh
  </span>
  . So tell me about your family
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  My family! I have two brothers and a sister, and my father
  <span class="audiodef">
   passed away
  </span>
  three years ago and my mom is working.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Do you
  <span class="audiodef">
   miss
  </span>
  idaho?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Friends. I&#39;ve made some best friends in Idaho actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually, I&#39;ve lived in L.A., Washington State, but Idaho.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  When is the last time you were in Idaho?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  When I, that&#39;s when I finished my program, so a long time ago. 10, wow, 12, 13 years ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that is a long time. OK, and where do you live now?
 </p>
