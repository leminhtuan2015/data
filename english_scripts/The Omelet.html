   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Keri! You cook, right? You&#39;re a pretty
                  good cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keri:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. I want to make an omelet. So actually
                                          this is really silly, I&#39;ve never made one before. How do you make an
                                          omelet?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keri:
  </strong>
  Well, I can teach you how I make them,
                                          which is the same way my father and grandmother make them so it is a
                                          little special.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Yeah! Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keri:
  </strong>
  First you take some eggs and
  <span class="audionotes">
   crack them
  </span>
  in a
                                          bowl.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Whisk
  </span>
  them up,  so they&#39;re quite high and fluffy. In a hot pan, and you need a pan that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of small that the
                                          sides go up
  <span class="audionotes">
   at an angle
  </span>
  . You put some oil and heat it up, so it&#39;s quite
                                          hot. Then you take your
  <span class="audionotes">
   whipped up
  </span>
  eggs or whisked up eggs and
                                          pour them into the pan. As it&#39;s cooking, if you take a spatula and
                                          push the bottom layer of the egg to the sides and then to the middle so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keri:
  </strong>
  OK. And keep doing that until most of the
                                          egg is cooked. You should have a nice thick omelet and then
  <span class="audionotes">
   flip it
                                            over
  </span>
  . You&#39;ll only have to cook that side lightly. Put your fillings on
                                          the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the
                                          cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. That sounds really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keri:
  </strong>
  Mm, it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. What fillings do you recommend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keri:
  </strong>
  Well, if you want to do a real simple
                                          one, you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese. That&#39;s easy
                                          or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese, onions,
                                          tomatoes, mushrooms, anything that you like. If you want to make a
                                          spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg
                                          mixture. It&#39;s actually cooked in it. It&#39;s inside bacon and sour
                                          cream is nice and Jack cheese.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. I&#39;ll have to give that a try. Thanks!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keri:
  </strong>
  OK. Sure.
