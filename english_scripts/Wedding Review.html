  Julia:
 </strong>
 So we&#39;re talking about your wedding, Nathan. Was it a stressful experience for you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Yes, I think you could say that it was pretty stressful in several ways. The first one was a kind of stupid thing was that a long time ago I&#39;d broken a tooth and a couple of days before I got married, the tooth got stuck in a chocolate bar and broke again. So I&#39;d been to an emergency...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You looked pretty then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;d been to an emergency dentist session to have a new cap stuck on but I was really worried that (a) I couldn&#39;t speak properly because my mouth was still a bit getting used to the shape of the tooth and I was worried that the tooth was going to
  <span class="audionotes">
   fall off
  </span>
  but also I&#39;m not very good in front of large groups of people and I had to, I had to do some speeches and I hadn&#39;t really...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You made a speech?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I didn&#39;t really memorize the speeches properly and so I really struggled with the speeches but I think the other thing was that I couldn&#39;t relax because everybody was taking photos and every time I wanted to have a drink of beer or have a mouthful of food, someone was like just one more photo, just one more photo and so I kept on saying to people like I&#39;m really tired, you know, I&#39;d really like to eat my food and everybody kept on coming up and taking photos and I actually got a bit frustrated and a bit...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You were
  <span class="audionotes">
   grumpy
  </span>
  on your wedding day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Well, I get grumpy everywhere. We had three parties so the first party was...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Three parties?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we had the wedding ceremony and then we had the meal and then we had like a second party where we did some games and then we had a third party at a karaoke booth which was fantastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Right and were you still in your wedding gear for all those parties?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Actually I said to you some time before that my wife had two wedding dresses but by the time we went to karaoke she was on her third wedding dress.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  So she had a pretty good time getting changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  It was a huge event then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  It was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  How long did it take to plan this wedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  I think it took only two months. My wife&#39;s pretty organized so she&#39;s like this is going to happen, this is going to happen, boom, boom, boom.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  So she made most of the important stressful decisions?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Oh yeah. The planning was easy for me. I just said yes to everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  And did you go on a honeymoon?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a major
  <span class="audionotes">
   bone of contention
  </span>
  . That&#39;s, I&#39;ve never been forgiven for this because we, I guess we really didn&#39;t have a huge amount of money and afterwards my wife wanted to take...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You spent a lot on the wedding.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, she wanted to have a really romantic honeymoon in the Maldives and I&#39;d actually put the idea of the Maldives into her head when I was drinking one time and afterwards, we didn&#39;t do anything after the wedding because we&#39;d been really busy during the wedding getting friends and family to
  <span class="audionotes">
   fly in
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You needed a break?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but then about a month later we went to Thailand and then we went to Singapore and we did lots of small trips in Malaysia and different things but they weren&#39;t really romantic and so my wife is still waiting for her romantic honeymoon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You went travelling, well that&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well.
