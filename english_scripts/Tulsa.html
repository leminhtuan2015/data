   So Tres, can you introduce yourself. Where are you from?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   Hello everyone, my name is Tres Goodman. I’m from Tulsa Oklahoma. I was originally born in St. Louis Missouri, but I spent most of my life in Tulsa Oklahoma and in Japan.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Wow. What’s your city like back home Tulsa?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   Tulsa’s an amazing city. We have about a half a million people, I think. Don’t hold me to it. There’s a lot of culture. Many people from various parts of the world, who either immigrated to Oklahoma, or their parents immigrated there. And therefore, they’re first generation. So we have lots of foods from all over the world. Oklahoma used to be a part of a Mexican state. So we have a very strong Mexican heritage that still exists. Going into food, of course we have food that’s similar to Northern Mexico, but we also have ribs which are probably the best you’ll ever find in the United States.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   The ribs. Why are the ribs so good?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   Because they’re so juicy and soft. You don’t need teeth.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   That’s pretty good. So when you say ribs, that’s beef ribs.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   Beef ribs, we also have pork spare ribs.
  </font>

    Todd:
   </strong>
   What’s the nightlife like in Tulsa?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   Night life, I haven’t been back in many years, but when I grew up there, I remember there being many clubs in the area. Majority of adults are single, so everyone’s looking for a spouse. I grew up playing music, so I would visit nightclubs and bars to play in bands when I was under age. So I think people really found ways to enjoy themselves.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Ok, so you say you were in a band and you played an instrument. What instrument did you play?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   I’m a drummer. I’ve played drums ever since I was in junior high. And I love music, so I’ve also played violin and I sang in a church choir ever since I was a little baby, growing up until university.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   That’s a lot of talent.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   It’s a lot of fun.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   What would you say is the best thing about Tulsa?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   The best thing about Tulsa, I would say, is the atmosphere. Once you go, people are so nice. They’ll invite you in to do anything that they’re doing. It’s just an easy town to fit in. It’s a large city, but it’s not too large. It still has a small town atmosphere like probably most middle-sized cities in the United States.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Is there anything that’s bad about Tulsa?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   Well, we do have our share of violent crimes. We have a river that’s pretty much polluted. It would be nice if it were a clean river so that we could swim in it. I would say that’s about it as far as I can remember.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   That’s ok. That sounds like two big enough problems right there.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tres:
   </strong>
   Yeah, pollution and crime.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Thanks Tres.
