   Todd
  </strong>
  : So Meg, do you live in a house or an apartment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I live in an apartment near the train station.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, you live downtown.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you like living downtown?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I do like living downtown because it&#39;s so convenient. Everything is close by, grocery stores, the mall, the station.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s great. So what about your apartment? Do you have a nice apartment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s a nice apartment, but it&#39;s really small.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah? How many rooms?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Well, there are three rooms. But each room is pretty small. There&#39;s a bedroom, a sitting room like a living room, and the kitchen room.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, wow. So in your bedroom, like, do you have a big
  <span class="audionotes">
   queen size
  </span>
  bed, a small bed?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I have a small twin size bed or a single bed in the bedroom because it&#39;s pretty small, so there&#39;s not much space for a big bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right. So do you have a TV in your bedroom?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : No. Actually, I don&#39;t own a TV at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Really? So there&#39;s no TV in the living room, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : There&#39;s no TV anywhere in the apartment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. What do you do in your house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I have a laptop computer. So usually, I can watch some TV shows or videos on my laptop.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  All right. Okay. Do you like to watch movies in bed?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Sometimes I like to watch movies in bed or sometimes I prefer to sit in the living room and watch movies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. So you must have high-speed Internet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I do. Yes. I have an Internet box that my laptop can connect to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Cool. Do you have a nice big sofa?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I have two small sofas. So you can push them together to make one big sofa or you can keep them
  <span class="audionotes">
   separate
  </span>
  . Usually, I keep them separate because there&#39;s more room for people to sit on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Now, you like to cook, so you must have a nice kitchen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Unfortunately, I have a very tiny kitchen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh no. How do you cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I have to use some extra tables to have more space. The
  <span class="audionotes">
   counter
  </span>
  is really small, so there&#39;s not much space. So I have an extra table I use for preparing the food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Do you have an oven?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I have a very small toaster oven, so it&#39;s not really an oven.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right. So do you have a microwave?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I do have a microwave and a small refrigerator and one burner, like a stove top burner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Do you cook every night?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t cook every night. Sometimes, I&#39;m too busy. And sometimes because my kitchen is so small, I get a little
  <span class="audionotes">
   frustrated
  </span>
  , so I just
  <span class="audionotes">
   pick up
  </span>
  some food from a restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right. Now, you live in an apartment, so how many floors does your apartment building have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : The building has five floors, and I live on the fifth floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Nice. Fifth floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah. The view is nice, but unfortunately, there&#39;s no elevator., so you always have to take the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. Five
  <span class="audionotes">
   flights of stairs
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Five flights of stairs everyday,but it&#39;s good exercise.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So you&#39;re on the fifth floor. Do you have a balcony?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I have a small balcony where my washing machine, is and I can also hang out my laundry out there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh cool, washing machine is outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It is outside. It&#39;s a little different from my house in America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So from your view, what can you see?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I can see the train station from one window and all the restaurants downtown. And from a different window, I can see the mountains.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh nice. Yeah, the mountains are nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it&#39;s really pretty.
