  Todd
 </strong>
 : So, Meg, you&#39;re getting married soon. How are things going?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Things are going pretty well. We have a lot of planning to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I bet. So have you hired a band yet?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : No, we haven&#39;t hired a band yet. My brother has some friends who were in a band. So he&#39;s going to ask them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Cool. And have you gotten the caterer for the wedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes, we have gotten a caterer because the food is very important. So we ordered it in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, what kind of food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : We&#39;re going to have traditional American food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, nice. Nice. So have you bought a dress yet?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes, of course, I have bought a dress. That&#39;s the most important part. So last week I picked up my new dress.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Have you tried it on yet?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes, I&#39;ve tried it on many times already.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Cool. Have you shown it to your groom-to-be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : No. I haven&#39;t shown it to my groom-to be because it has to be a surprise on the wedding day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s right.  So have you ordered the flowers?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : No, not yet. I haven&#39;t ordered the flowers because I&#39;m waiting for some special flowers from the florist. So still waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And have you sent out the invitations?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes. We have sent out the invitations. We sent them out maybe a month ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, cool. So then I assume you have booked the hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes. We have booked the hall because we wanted to have it at a special hall. So we booked it probably six months ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Cool. Well, the only one problem, I didn&#39;t get an invite. Am I invited to your wedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, I brought the invitation with me today.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Great. Thanks.
