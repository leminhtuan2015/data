   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Diana we are going to talk about your
  <span class="audiodef">
   hobby
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What is your hobby?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  I have lots of different hobbies but right now I&#39;m learning to
  <span class="audiodef">
   play the guitar
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Great. How long have you been playing or practicing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  I got my guitar two years ago but I&#39;ve probably
  <span class="audiodef">
   spent
  </span>
  a total of two weeks practicing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did you bring your guitar to Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  I didn&#39;t. Actually, my brother wants to learn to play also so he&#39;s taking good care of my guitar while I&#39;m here, but when I get back I&#39;ll
  <span class="audiodef">
   jump right back
  </span>
  into practicing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, great. Well, who&#39;s a better player?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  I am for sure, but I told him that if he gets better than me while I&#39;m away that he has to teach me everything he knows.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s only fair. OK. Can you play any songs?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  Yes, I can play &#34;Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee&#34; and just the last part of the &#34;Star Spangled Banner&#34;. Not the beginning, the beginning&#39;s
  <span class="audiodef">
   way too hard
