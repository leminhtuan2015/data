   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Rebecca we&#39;re talking about working in a restaurant. Now you became a chef. Can you talk about the process of becoming a chef? What do you do to get a job in a kitchen?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Well, there&#39;s lots of different ways, but the most common way is to become an
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    apprentice
   </span>
  </span>
  which means you go to the kitchen and work at the bottom level doing the basic chopping - boring jobs - for maybe two or three years, and then one day a week you go to school, a cooking school. Your employer pays for you to go to the school. You do get paid by your employer but it&#39;s a
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    really small wage
   </span>
  </span>
  , so, yeah. Otherwise, you can start at the bottom, like a dishwasher, and actually Australia&#39;s most famous chef started that way. He just was a dishwasher and he slowly
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    climbed up the ladder
   </span>
  </span>
  , so you can do it that way as well.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what about you? Did you go to cooking school?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I did, but actually I
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    dropped out
   </span>
  </span>
  after awhile, so I did that for about a year but to be honest I think you get more experience in a kitchen. Sometimes the stuff they teach you at school is a little bit old-fashioned.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  How much actually of what you learn do you just learn on yourself, as just a creative process? Like how much do you think you learn by watching others and how much do you learn on your own, using your own creativity?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I think both are really important. Actually, I learned a lot from my mother. When I was a kid, I used to watch her cooking all the time, and it wasn&#39;t until I grew up that I realized how much I understood about cooking just from seeing what she did in the kitchen, but also talking about how to do things with your colleagues I think is really important.
 </p>

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, I&#39;m curious, you know how to cook, and everybody knows you know how to cook - family members and friends - so how... do you like to actually cook for family members and friends or is cooking a job that when you go home, you prefer not to cook for other people because it&#39;s like
  <span class="audionotes">
   bringing your work home
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p align="left">
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Well, I know some chefs that have nothing in their fridge and they hate cooking at home, but I&#39;m not like that. I really love cooking for people. It&#39;s really the nicest thing you can do for someone is to give them a lovely meal. The sad thing is actually that no one will ever cook for me, because they&#39;re too scared. They always apologize before I even have a chance to eat it. &#34;Oh, it&#39;s going to be terrible. Oh, you&#39;re a cook. I&#39;m sorry.&#34; But actually I love food being cooked for me. I wish people would do it more.

  OK. That&#39;s funny. Thanks Rebecca.
