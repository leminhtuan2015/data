   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Hi. So Rory.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Yeah, hi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Hi. Are you an introvert or an extrovert?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : I’m not sure, you know. Sometimes I think that I’m basically an introvert. Like as I get older, I much prefer
  <span class="audionotes">
   my own company
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : I don’t really like going to parties that much if there’s going to be new people there. If it’s my friends, I’m happy to go out, but I don’t know. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : It’s funny what you said. I feel the same way. I think sometimes I’m an introvert and other times I can be an extrovert. But maybe
  <span class="audionotes">
   in reverse
  </span>
  to what you said. I feel like the older I get, the more extroverted I become.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : That’s interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : While I was younger, I was a lot shier, so I preferred my own company. But now I find that sometimes too, I really enjoy people. So I like to meet new ones. So yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Yes. In the classroom, as a teacher, I’m quite an extrovert I think. I quite like being up in front of students and
  <span class="audionotes">
   showing of
  </span>
  , but I would never do that in front of other teachers or my friends, in my personal life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : But something about the classroom maybe because it’s my environment and I’m in control that I feel more comfortable, like being more extroverted and showing off, camping up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I think it would be a little difficult to be introverted if you were a language teacher. I think it certainly helps to be extroverted or to act to be able to become more extroverted when you’re in the classroom for sure. For sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Yeah. And have you ever done anything really extroverted, like performed
  <span class="audionotes">
   in public
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Before I used to sing actually, and I have sang in concerts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : And it’s true. I think that’s where my introverted self really comes out because although I enjoy singing and I like the attention to
  <span class="audionotes">
   a certain extent
  </span>
  , but I get really nervous. Really, really nervous when I’m in front of a large crowd. And sometimes I’m like, “Why am I doing this to myself? Why am I here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : But yeah, I don’t do that so much anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Right. And do you think people can change? Do you think people – because people seem to want to become more extroverted? It seems to be like society says extroverted people are successful people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : It’s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Do you think people can change or do you think people should try to change?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I’ve heard of actually people saying that depending on the language that people change with the language. I’ve heard of some of my students saying that when they speak in a different language, their personality actually changes, where maybe in their own language, they may be quieter. But when they speak the different language, they become a lot more extroverted.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : It’s as if they change. So whether or not it’s a real change I think you can “fake it”
  <span class="audionotes">
   quote-unquote
  </span>
  even if you’re not an extrovert or an introvert. Maybe for a few hours or for the occasion. Yeah, you can pretend, and then go back.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Right. I wonder if when we speak a different language, we don’t have the same connections with the words.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That’s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : It makes it easier to maybe speak more honestly and not worry about what other people think of us.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That’s true.
