  Chris:
 </strong>
 Well, actually, Lindsay, I have a surprise. A bit of news to tell you as well. I&#39;m getting married.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  No way!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re getting married?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Yep. I&#39;m actually getting married before you, probably in March.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. Have you started planning?

  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Yes, and it&#39;s one of those things that
  <span class="audionotes">
   once you start, you just can&#39;t stop
  </span>
  . There&#39;s too many decisions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I bet, so do you want to have a big wedding like me or do you want a smaller wedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  No, we think maybe only fifty people, so we&#39;re probably only going to keep it quite small. We might just have it in a restaurant somewhere, and we&#39;re kind of planning just to have it in front of people and friends, and just people that we really know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Do you think you&#39;ll have it in the daytime or at night?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  I think probably in the daytime would be nice because a lot of her family are quite old so we&#39;re gonna have to keep it before it gets too dark and they all fall asleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Are you going to hire a photographer or a band?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  We&#39;ll definitely have a photographer, but we don&#39;t really want a band. We would like it a little bit smaller so maybe just a couple of violin players, or maybe a piano.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, that sounds nice. And then are you going to hire a florist?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Well, actually we don&#39;t have to hire a florist because my fiance is a professionally trained horticulturalist and florist herself so she makes wedding bouquets as part of her job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, so she&#39;ll make the flowers for your wedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  She wants to do some of it and also a lot of her friends will be able to
  <span class="audionotes">
   chip in
  </span>
  and help out as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Are you going to choose some wedding colors?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Wedding colors? I don&#39;t even know what that means.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  So for my wedding my colors are red and
  <span class="audionotes">
   fuchsia
  </span>
  because I like bright colors. Are you gonna choose a shade of colors for your flowers to be and what you&#39;ll wear?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  I guess that&#39;s probably a question you wanna ask my fiance. She&#39;s more interested in things like that. I&#39;ll know when I see the flowers if they&#39;re some kind of theme, but we&#39;ve not talked about that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Well, one question that I have that I&#39;m confused about: are you going to get someone to video tape it or do you think that it&#39;s just enough to have the photographer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Actually, that&#39;s not something that we talked about, but I&#39;ve been to weddings before where they&#39;ve had it with someone video taping it, and it always seems a little bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   too intrusive
  </span>
  . Like someone was having to come up and they&#39;re saying, &#34;Oh, do you want to have a message? Do you want to give a message?&#34; and suddenly you&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   on the spot
  </span>
  and you don&#39;t know what to say, so I think it&#39;ll be enough for the photographer and also, we&#39;ll have our memories as well so we don&#39;t need the video.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Right. That&#39;s good. Good idea. I do think that afterwards it might be nice to show my kids when they grow up, &#34;This is when mommy and daddy got married&#34; on the video camera, but I&#39;m still
  <span class="audionotes">
   grappling with
  </span>
  that idea if I want to video, someone to video it or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Well, I always worry that something embarrassing might happen and then forever that&#39;s gonna be up on Youtube or something like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true. That could happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  If we keep it to photographs, we can just delete it or kind of get rid of that film so, I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll talk about that beforehand, but I&#39;m really excited about it.
