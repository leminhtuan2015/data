   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hey Todd, let&#39;s talk about months and American holidays.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right, let&#39;s do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Great. What holiday is in January?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, on January 1st, we have New Year&#39;s Day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s very fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I love New Year&#39;s Day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about February?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : In February, we have Valentine&#39;s Day on February 14th.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s right, so romantic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t like Valentine&#39;s Day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I never have a girlfriend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, sorry. What about March? What holiday is in March?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : March has St. Patrick&#39;s Day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : On March 17th?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes. Do you usually celebrate St. Patrick&#39;s Day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I do. I love green. Green is my favorite color.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : What about April?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : April has April fool&#39;s Day, but that&#39;s not a holiday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Not really, but it&#39;s still fun to celebrate on April 1st.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. Oh, usually Easter is in April.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Usually yes, but the day changes every year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. Sometimes it&#39;s March though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : True.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right, okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : What about in May? What holidays are in May?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : In May, I think a lot of countries have a holiday on May 1st, but America doesn&#39;t have a holiday on May 1st, but we do like to have fun celebrations for Cinco de Mayo, May 5th.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Right. What do you usually do for Cinco de Mayo?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : We usually eat Mexican food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Same.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I hear that in Mexico they don&#39;t celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it&#39;s only in America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s funny.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, funny. I actually heard that St. Patrick&#39;s Day also is not popular in Ireland.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s surprising.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I don&#39;t know. Maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay, what about June?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : In June, we have the first day of summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What day is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I think it&#39;s on June 21st.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg:
  </strong>
  The longest day of the year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I love that day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : In July?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : In July, in America of course, we have July 4th, Independence Day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. What do you do on July 4th, Independence Day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Usually, I would have a barbecue with friends and family and watch fireworks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, me too. The same.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about August? Is there a holiday in August?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I can&#39;t think of a holiday in August, but my brother&#39;s birthday is August 15th.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, my younger brother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Do you know of any holidays in August?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t, but usually school is out in August, so for the whole month there&#39;s no school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, vacation time. What about September?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, September has Labor Day, but I don&#39;t remember the day. Is it September 1st?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m not sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I think it&#39;s September 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I think it changes every year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Maybe it&#39;s the first Monday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I think so. Let&#39;s see, after September, what holiday is in October?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : The best holiday, Halloween.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes, I love Halloween.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Halloween is October 31st.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Right. Every year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Plus, October has my birthday.

  We also have New Year&#39;s Eve, which is December 31st.

  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Right, both fun holidays.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
