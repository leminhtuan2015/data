   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Simon, how old is your son now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s just over three months now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so it should be pretty

   fresh in your memory

  . Do you remember what it was like the day he was born?

   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sure. I was in the operating room.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No kidding. The delivery room.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  In the delivery room. Not the operating room. Sorry. Well, the do operate, kind of, but the delivery room so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, let&#39;s go to the very beginning, like your at home, like what happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  So I was, as usual it happens when you never expect it, and it came a couple of days earlier than we thought, and she had
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/644-2-labor-pains.mp3">
   labor pains
  </a>
  at about 4 o&#39;clock in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Then we took her to the hospital. I took a couple pictures of her, just for the buddies, &#34;Hey, look at my better half in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. So you got the hospital by car, by taxi. Were you driving fast?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  I think we went by car and then I said, and then I went back home to get breakfast and then because labor usually takes a long time so I thought we&#39;d have time but, I went home for breakfast and and went back to the hospital and she was already on the table in the delivery room table.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was quite fast. It took about three hours I guess which is on the quick side of delivery but when I saw here she was a total different person. She was like not a real human being because the pain was so hard, like
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/644-3-delirious.mp3">
   delirious
  </a>
  or subconcious but I think all woman are like that because I saw a couple other women and they looked like they were zombies. That&#39;s why I said, like they say women have a higher threshold for pain. It&#39;s true. I think men would die.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  But having said that, it was quite a
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/644-4-mind-boggling.mp3">
   mind-boggling
  </a>
  experience, you know, like all of a sudden there&#39;s this little putple lump in front of you and it goes to purple to skin color before your eyes. (Wow) Yeah, and yeah, it&#39;s awake. A human being.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So the baby cries instantly when comes out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think it really cries that much. It doesn&#39;t have that image that many of us have that the doctor slaps the, and then cries like a baby, but yeah, maybe it
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/644-5-whimper.mp3">
   wimpers
  </a>
  a little bit every now and then. It&#39;s for the most part, quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m sure it was an amazing day. That&#39;s cool. Thanks Simon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, no problem.
