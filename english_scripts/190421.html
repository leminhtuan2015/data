Armed rebels attacked an Ebola treatment center Saturday near the Congolese city of Butembo just hours after another attack at that same center killed a Cameroon epidemiologist.

One militia member was killed in the attack at Katwa hospital where medical staffers are trying to contain an Ebola outbreak in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
<br><br>
Four rebels were captured.

The latest attack came after the World Health Organization reported Friday that epidemiologist Richard Mouzoko was killed when several gunmen from a local militia stormed the hospital.

<br><br>
Edward Yeranian reports.
<br><br>
A smiling President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi cast his ballot as polling began Saturday morning in a three-day referendum (to) make changes to Egypt's post-revolution constitution.
<br><br>
Those changes will strengthen his hand over parts of the government and lengthen his term in office from four to six years.
<br><br>
Sixty-two million Egyptians are registered to vote of an estimated population of around 100 million.
<br><br>
A large number of people could be seen at several polling stations in the center of Cairo while others in outlying parts of the capital and Giza appeared to have a light turnout.

Mourners marked 20 years Saturday since the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Mike Gracia recounts the advance of that day.
<br><br>
It was a shocking event.  The date was April 20, 1999.  Two disaffected young men, both teenagers and students at the school, opened fire at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado.  They killed 12 fellow students and a teacher and wounded two dozen others before taking their own lives.
<br><br>
In the aftermath, there were questions of why and how could this happen.
<br><br>
One month later, President Bill Clinton told Columbine students "What happened to you has pierced the soul of America."
