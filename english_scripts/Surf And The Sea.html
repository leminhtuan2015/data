    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Well, one day I was surfing and my friend said, &#34;Oh, I see a shark&#34; so I&#39;m just like, &#34;Right, you didn&#39;t see no shark&#34; so you know we keep on surfing and next thing you know, we&#39;re surfing some more and it was like, &#34;Ah, Mitch. I promise I saw a shark. I saw a shark&#34;. I was like, &#34;Man, you&#39;re lying.
   <span class="audionotes">
    Just shut up
   </span>
   &#34; you know cause my friends tend to joke a lot when they&#39;re surfing you know, cause we like to enjoy. So we&#39;re surfing and
   <span class="audionotes">
    the next thing you know
   </span>
   , we hear this siren coming, and like 200 yards away, we see this girl like getting out of the water like franticly. It&#39;s like, next thing you know, since we go out, we see an ambulance, something happened, like
   <span class="audionotes">
    commotion
   </span>
   , and everyone&#39;s going &#34;Oh, this girl got bitten by a shark.&#34;

    Joel:
   </strong>
   Oh, my god.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Well, not bad but like bit her toes or something. It&#39;s a reef shark. They&#39;re not very big but they tend to swim close to shore and in the rocks, cause like, a lot of people, they, we surf by the reef because the waves break nicely but it is also dangerous because you have the chance of hitting you head on the reef and getting
   <span class="audionotes">
    scrapes and cuts

   What other kinds of wildlife do you see in the ocean? I surfed in California and they have like, Pelicans and sometimes dolphins.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Yeah, we see dolphins, we see manta rays, We see a lot of turtles.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Turtles, like the green sea turtles
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Green sea turtles. Like back in the days,
   <span class="audionotes">
    it was legal
   </span>
   to eat turtles,
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   So, the what?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   It was legal to eat turtles.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Oh, legal to eat turtles.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   So people made like turtle soup, cause the meats like real tender, juicy, white, but they kind of got like extinct so they made a law saying that you can&#39;t eat turtles so now, right now, you can see a lot of turtles when you&#39;re surfing or in general in you&#39;re in Waikiki beach, some of those famous beach, you can see a lot of turtles.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   By the way, what kind of board do you surf on, a long board or.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   A long board or short board, or tankers, like it matters how the wave is, where in, what part of the beach I&#39;m at. I usually surf, like 7-foot boards. Short boards or long boards.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   So you check the weather forecast before you go?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   yeah, call the surf hotline, the surf hotline saying, where&#39;s good, how strong the trade winds are, how deep the buoys are.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   I see. Oh, you make me want to go surfing. Let&#39;s stop.
