Firefighters are struggling to put out a forest fire that broke out in the mountains of southwestern China over the weekend.  At least 26 firefighters have been killed, four are missing, according to state media reports on Monday.
<br><br>
The fire began Saturday in Muli county of Sichuan province at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, with poor transport and communication links.
<br><br>
By Sunday afternoon, nearly 700 firefighters were working to put out the fire, but 30 went missing after a surge of flames fed by a sudden shift in the wind.

China says it will start regulating all fentanyl-related drugs as a class of controlled substances.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Matt Small reports.
<br><br>
U.S. officials have pointed to China as the main source of synthetic opioids shipped into the country directly by mail or transported via Mexico, a claim China denies.
<br><br>
Now in a sweeping policy shift U.S. officials have long pushed for and due to take effect May 1, China will begin regulating all fentanyl-related drugs as a class of controlled substances.
<br><br>
A Chinese official says the move should block the loopholes by which drug makers trade new variants of opioids faster than they could be banned.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Fentanyl and compounds that mimic its effects are blamed for tens of thousands of opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. each year.

A Vietnamese woman is now the only suspect remaining in detention in Malaysia for killing the half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.
<br><br>
A lawyer for the woman said Monday that his client has pleaded guilty to a charge of causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means.
<br><br>
The woman was charged with smearing the deadly nerve agent VX on the face of Kim Jong Nam in Kuala Lumpur's airport in February, 2017.

Ukraine is preparing for three weeks of impassioned political campaigning as a television comedian goes head-to-head with the incumbent for the presidency in a runoff scheduled for April 21.
<br><br>
As widely predicted, Volodymyr Zelenskiy easily won the first round of voting Sunday with around 30 percent of the votes.  He needed a margin of more than 50 percent for an outright victory.
<br><br>
He will face Petro Poroshenko in a runoff.  The incumbent came in second at 16 percent.
<br><br>
The majority of votes have now been counted.

An Israeli watchdog says it has found fake social media accounts promoting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the lead up to national elections.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Charles De Ledesma reports.
<br><br>
Researchers at the Big Bots Project say they've identified a network of social media bots where fake accounts have spread messages in support of Netanyahu's Likud party and smearing his opponents.
<br><br>
The researchers haven't found a direct link between the network and Netanyahu or Likud.  But Netanyahu's son has frequently liked posts by the network's accounts.
<br><br>
The Likud party denies any connection to the network.
<br><br>
Israelis head to the polls in eight days in a close race between Netanyahu and his main rival, former army chief of staff Benny Gantz.

The majority Democrats in the United States House of Representatives are preparing to ramp up their efforts to get the full report from special counsel Robert Mueller on Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
<br><br>
AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports.
<br><br>
Democrats had set a deadline tomorrow to get the full report.  The Justice Department appears likely to miss it and the following day, the House Judiciary Committee will also vote to authorize subpoenas to get the report.
<br><br>
Attorney General William Barr has released a four-page summary and says he'll put out a scrubbed version of the full report by mid-month.
<br><br>
Democrats, though, want the whole thing unfiltered by Barr.
<br><br>
He'd written the special counsel found no Trump campaign coordination with Russia.  But he also went further than Bob Mueller by saying there is not enough evidence to prove the president obstructed the Russian investigation.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
A whistleblower from inside the White House has told congressional investigators that senior Trump administration officials granted national security clearances to at least 25 people that government reviewers had rejected.
<br><br>
The whistleblower said the officials cleared for security credentials after career employees recommended that they be denied, include two current unnamed senior White House officials, government contractors, and other aides working for the office of the president.
