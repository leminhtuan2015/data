   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So, Jonathan, I&#39;d like to meet a nice girl. I&#39;m looking to meet a nice girl but I&#39;m not quite sure where we should go to meet women. What do you think? Where&#39;s a good place to meet some women?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  You know, that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   hard to say
  </span>
  , I mean, there are all kinds of things that work for other people that they haven&#39;t necessarily worked for me. I mean, I talk to people who say that met girls in libraries, but I don&#39;t really want to go to a library. Usually they&#39;ve got a
  <span class="audionotes">
   silence
  </span>
  rule. I don&#39;t want to go up and try to talk to a girl and have the librarian say, SHHH!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Actually, one of my friends told me that he met a girl in the grocery store once in one of the
  <span class="audionotes">
   aisles
  </span>
  . He was looking at milk and she came up beside him, so maybe we should go get some groceries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  That seems to be a really unnatural kind of way to meet women in a grocery store. Maybe is a woman sees that you&#39;re buying individual portions of something and you&#39;re buying like little TV dinners that are only put in the microwave oven, she knows that you don&#39;t have someone at home cooking for you, but if I go out and I see a woman filling a basket with lots of tomatoes and cucumbers and so on, then I imagine she&#39;s probably cooking for a family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Well, why don&#39;t we go do something like bowling. Bowling! Women love to bowl. I&#39;m sure we can meet some nice ladies at the bowling alley.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Oh, but women don&#39;t like putting on those ugly shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Well, then...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   unfashionable
  </span>
  when they go to the bowling alleys.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Well, then, shopping! Let&#39;s go shopping. Girls love shopping. We can meet them at a store.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Girls love shopping but then they&#39;re gonna make you hold their bags for two hours while they go and try on different things. That&#39;s no fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  How about a concert?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Ah, no, Too noisy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess you can&#39;t talk to women there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Well, I think actually, another one of my friends once met a lady at a bank - the bank teller.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Bank teller.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  That would seem like a little bit of a strange thing, and there I think the woman would be
  <span class="audionotes">
   judging you
  </span>
  by how much money you have in your account. She&#39;d be able to see all of your information.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, I think let&#39;s just go to the pub.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
