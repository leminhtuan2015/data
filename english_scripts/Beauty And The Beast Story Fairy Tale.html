     Once upon a time there was a very rich man who lived with his three daughters.  The two older daughters laughed at anyone who did not dress as well as they did.  If the two of them were not resting at home, they were out shopping for as many fine dresses and hats as they could carry home.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;">
     <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;">
      The youngest daughter, Beauty, loved to read.
     </span>
     <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;">
      “Your nose is always in a book,&#34; her two older sisters said.  They laughed.  &#34;No one will want you! Look at your hair.  You look like a servant girl!”  Beauty did not know why they were so mean.  But she said nothing.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     One day, the father got some bad news.  He had spent all of his money on a ship that he sent out to sea for trade.  Now he learned the ship was gone!  Everything on it was lost.  All at once, the rich father became as poor as poor could be.

     The family could no longer stay in their big house.  The fine house, its fine tables and chairs, and all of their fine things, had to be sold.

     <strong>
      One day, the father got some very bad news.
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     All the father had left was a little hut, deep in the woods.  So that is where he and his three daughters had to move.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Living in the hut in the woods was hard work.  Each day a fire had to be started, meals cooked, the place cleaned up, the garden tended, and things needed fixing when they broke.  Now that the family was poor, you might think the two older sisters would help out.  Think again.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “She looks like such a mess,” they said, turning up their noses at Beauty.  “She might as well serve us.”  And so Beauty did all the hard work.  The sisters slept late, took naps, and showed up for meals.
    </span>
    <br>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;">
     <strong>
      “She looks such a mess,” they said, turning up their noses.
     </strong>
    </span>
    <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-190" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad">
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Then – good news! – the father’s ship came to shore!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “My daughters!” said the happy father. “I am going to town.  Tell me what fine gift I can bring back for you.”
    </span>
    <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-170" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad">
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Bring me the best dress from the best shop in town,” said the oldest sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “I want one just like it,” said the middle sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “And you, Beauty?” he said.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “All I want, Father,” she said, “is a rose.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Can you believe her?” said the eldest sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “What a fool!” said the middle sister.  And they both laughed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Girls!” said the father.  “If that is what Beauty wants, that is what I will bring for her.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 24px;">
     <strong>
      “All I want, Father,” said she, “is a rose.&#34;
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     The father was on his way home when he thought, “Oh my!  I forgot all about the rose for Beauty!”  All at once, the sky turned black.  “Dear, me! A storm is coming!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     A moment later, heavy dark rains fell down hard from the sky.  Soaking wet, the father saw a blink of light far away.  He went closer to the light.  Maybe it was a place he could stay for the night.  When he got up close, he saw that it was a large palace with candles in all its windows.  Very odd, but the front door was open.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     So, the father stepped inside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Hello?” he said.  No answer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     There, before him, was a great feast on a long table.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Hello?” he said again.  Still no answer.  He dared not touch any food on the table.  The father sat down in front of the fire to warm himself.  He waited.  But no one came.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “I suppose it would be all right if I stayed the night,” said the father.  &#34;And maybe just one bite.&#34; He took a quick bite from the feast.  Then he found a bedroom and fell fast asleep.
    </span>
    <br>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 24px;">
     <strong>
      “Hello?” he said.  No answer.
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     The next morning the table was laid again, but this time with breakfast.  Again - most odd! - no one was there.  “I suppose I should leave now,” said the father.
    </span>
    <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad">
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     On the way out, he passed a rose garden.  “Ah, I was to bring Beauty a rose!&#34; he remembered.  &#34;I will take just one.”  And he picked a rose for Beauty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Just then, a loud stomp came up from behind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Roared a voice - “You took my rose!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     The father spun around.  There before him was an awful, huge monster.  “I… I’m sorry!” he said.  “I didn’t know.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     &#34;How could you not know?&#34; roared the Beast. “You will pay for this! You will die!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     The father fell on his knees.  “Please!” he begged.  “Do not kill me! I only picked the rose for one of my daughters.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 24px;">
     <strong>
      “You will pay for this!” the Beast yelled.  “You will die!”
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     &#34;You have daughters?” said the Beast. “Well.  If one of them will come stay here in your place, I will let you go free.  She must stay here forever.  In three months, if none of them will come in your place, you must return yourself and take your punishment.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     When the father got home, Beauty could tell something was wrong.  “What is it, Father?” she said.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Oh, nothing,” he said.  But she knew that was not true.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     At last, the father told his girls what the Beast had said.  “This all happened because I asked you to bring home a rose for me!” said Beauty.  “I will go there in your place.  Or else, you will die there.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “No, I cannot allow that!” said the father.  “I am old.  I do not have much more time to live.  You are young.  You must not do this for me!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     But Beauty would not change her mind.  And so two days later, the father took Beauty to the castle where the Beast lived.
    </span>
    <br>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 24px;">
     <strong>
      “I will go there in your place.  Or else, you will die there.&#34;
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “This is your daughter?” said the Beast, looking at Beauty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Yes, I am,” she said.  “I will stay here for my father.  And that means he is free to go.  That is what you said.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Yes,” said the Beast.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     At the Beast&#39;s palace, the days were long.  There was no one for Beauty to talk to, and no books to read.  Every night at nine, the Beast would come for dinner.  She would say nothing.  After all, it is not easy to be a prisoner, even if you are at a palace.  The Beast would only grunt.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Then one time at dinner the Beast made a little joke, and she smiled.  Another time, he said something clever, and she looked him in the eye.  After that, he would ask her about her day, and she would tell him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 24px;">
     <strong>
      The days were long and there was no one for Beauty to talk to.
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     One day, Beauty came to a part of the palace she had not seen before.  Over a door was a sign, “Beauty’s Room.”  The door was open.  Inside the room were shelves of books from the floor to the ceiling.  There was a piano, and a cabinet of fine dresses just her size.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Now there was much to talk about at dinner!  The Beast was glad that Beauty found the room and liked her surprise.  One night, at the end of dinner, Beast said, “Beauty, I love you.  Will you marry me?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Beauty did not know what to say.  “Beast, I have come to like it better here,&#34; she said.  &#34;Talking to you can be the best part of the day. But please understand.  I don&#39;t want you to marry you.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Many times, the Beast asked her the same question.  And each time Beauty shook her head and said the same thing.  One night, the Beast said, “Beauty, if you will not marry me, what can I do to make you happy?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “If you must know,” she said, “it would be to see my father.  I miss him so much!”
    </span>
    <br>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 24px;">
     <strong>
      &#34;Beast, I have come to like it better here,&#34; she said.  &#34;Talking to you can be the best part of the day. But please understand.  I don&#39;t want to marry you.&#34;
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     The next night, the Beast gave Beauty two magical gifts - a mirror and a ring.  “If you want to see your father,” he said, “just ask the magic mirror to take you to him.  When you are ready to come back, turn the ring on your finger three times.  Ask the mirror to bring you back here. But please do not be gone for more than one week.  For I will die of grief!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Beauty was glad to agree.  When she got back to her room, she looked in the magic mirror.  She asked the mirror to take her to him.  And there he was in bed right before her.  Yet he looked so sick, it was as if he may die!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 22px;">

     Such joy her father felt when he looked up and saw Beauty!  For much of what made him sick was knowing that Beauty was stuck in the palace, all because of him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Beauty stayed by her father’s bed for many hours.  She told him that things were not quite so bad at the Beast&#39;s palace.  She had all the books she could want to read.  She had music to play, and many fine dresses to wear.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “The Beast is really not so bad,” she said, “when you get to know him.  He can be good to talk to.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Beauty looked around.  “Where are my sisters?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Married,” said her father.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Did they marry good men?” she said.

     “They had money,” said the father.  “But I do not know if your sisters are happy.”  For the eldest sister had married a handsome man who thought of no one but himself.  And the middle sister had married a man who was very clever.  But he used his sharp wit to hurt everyone around him, and most of all his wife.

      Beauty looked around.  “Where are my sisters?” she said.
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     When the sisters came to the house and saw Beauty dressed so well and talking about how kind and good the Beast was to her, they burned with anger.  Beauty told them she must stay no more than one week.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     And the two sisters came up with a plan.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     The sisters petted Beauty and said such nice things to her they had never said before.  When she told them she must go soon, they cried.  They said she must not leave!  There was still so much left they wanted to do with her.  And what did it matter anyway, just a few more days? So Beauty stayed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     One night she had a dream about the Beast.  In her dream, the Beast lay sick and dying.  When Beauty woke up, she asked the magic mirror to show her the Beast.  And there he was in the mirror, lying in the rose garden, looking so sick he would die.  At once, she turned the magic ring three times.  “Take me back to the Beast!” she said.  In a moment she was sitting next to the poor, sick Beast, who could only gasp for air.

      In her dream, the Beast lay sick and dying.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     &#34;You came back!” said the Beast in a thick voice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “I am sorry that I am late!” said Beauty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “I could not bear it that you may not come back to me.  And now, I fear it is too late.”  His eyes closed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “No!” cried Beauty.  “Do not leave me!”  Just then, she knew in her heart what was true.  “I love you!” she cried out.  “Please come back!  Come back and I will be your wife. I will!”  Tears rolled down her cheeks.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     Just then, the Beast opened his eyes.  “Beauty!” he said.  “You did it!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     In a flash, the Beast was changed to a handsome prince!  Beauty did not know what to think.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     “Ah, Beauty!” he said.  And the Beast told her his story.  Years ago when he was a prince, an evil fairy had put a spell on him.  He must stay a beast forever, until a maiden grew to love him when he still looked like a Beast.  Now she had been the one to break the spell!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 20px;">
     And so Beauty and her prince, formerly the Beast, were married.  And they lived happily ever after.
