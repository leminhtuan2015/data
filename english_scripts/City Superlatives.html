 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Hey, Sarah. How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Good. How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Not bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : So I heard you are from San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : That’s right. Yeah, I was born there and I lived in the city for many years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Cool. What is the most interesting thing about your city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Well, San Francisco has many interesting things, but the most interesting thing is probably the
  <span class="audionotes">
   architecture
  </span>
  . There’s lots of very unique buildings. And the most
  <span class="audionotes">
   unique
  </span>
  building is probably the Trans-America building. It’s a building like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   pyramid
  </span>
  . It’s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Well, that’s really cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Uh-hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : What is the most expensive area in San Francisco?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Well, it is very, very expensive. The most expensive area is a place called Pacific Heights, and it’s on the highest hill in San Francisco and it
  <span class="audionotes">
   overlooks
  </span>
  the Bay. It’s a really, really beautiful place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : That area
  <span class="audionotes">
   by far
  </span>
  has the best views of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Hmm, what is the most beautiful place in San Francisco?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Well, actually the most beautiful place is outside the city. It’s a place called Muir Woods. And it has the tallest trees in the world, and some of these trees are really old. They are the oldest trees in North America. Some of them are
  <span class="audionotes">
   over
  </span>
  2,000 years old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Wow. It sounds like some place I would like to see. So it sounds really expensive. Where is the cheapest place to live?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : The cheapest place to live is a place called Sunset. And Sunset is on the west side, and the houses are kind of old and they’re a little bit cheap. But one thing about Sunset is it has nicest view of the ocean, and you could watch the sunset every night. That’s why it’s called the Sunset area.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Hmm. If I wanted to go there, when is the best time to visit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Well, the best time is probably in the fall because that’s when the weather is the nicest. It’s not too cold, and it’s not too hot. And it doesn’t rain that much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : So when would be the worst time to visit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : The worst time to visit would be probably February and March, because February and March are the coldest and wettest months. So – well, March isn’t that cold but sometimes it’s wet, so it rains a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Wow. That sounds really great. I want to go there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah, you should. It’s great place.
