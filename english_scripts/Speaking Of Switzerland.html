  Todd:
 </strong>
 Now, also your country is really famous for having different regions, correct? You have three main regions?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  We have four.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Four?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Could you talk about them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, we have four regions and this actually concerns the languages, which we have four official languages. It&#39;s German, French, Italian, and Romansh. And actually, the last one, Romansh, it became an
  <span class="audionotes">
   official language
  </span>
  just like twelve years ago, and only a little part the Swiss population can speak Romansh, actually, but it just sort of became a national, an official language some years ago. And yeah, well, the country&#39;s really small and we sometimes have some troubles communicating to each other, but usually people talk at least two languages, so
  <span class="audionotes">
   it works out
  </span>
  most of the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, in your country, you don&#39;t have the one
  <span class="audionotes">
   uniform language
  </span>
  that everybody speaks?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  No, we don&#39;t. Like we have Swiss, but Swiss is only being used in the German speaking part of Switzerland, which means like we don&#39;t actually use German when we talk. It&#39;s only for writing, but when we talk to each other, to our parents, to our teachers, we use Swiss.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Swiss is closest to German? It&#39;s Germanic?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, you can say that but it&#39;s very difficult for German people to understand us when we&#39;re talking actually because it&#39;s really fast and a really cute language,
  <span class="audionotes">
   apparently
  </span>
  . Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, what is the percentage breakdown, like what percentage is French, Italian, etc?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  I couldn&#39;t tell you the percentage but the biggest part is German, followed by French, Italian, and Romansh is only
  <span class="audionotes">
   <span class="audionotes">
    zero point five percent
   </span>
   of the population, so.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And
  <span class="audionotes">
   just out of curiosity
  </span>
  , Romansh, what does that sound like? Does that sound like Italian or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a mix of the three main languages I would say, like a mix of German, French, and Italian and,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I can catch a word here or there
  </span>
  but, yeah, I don&#39;t really understand it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And lastly, what part are you from in Switzerland?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from the German part.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, thanks Anja.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, you&#39;re welcome.
 </p>
