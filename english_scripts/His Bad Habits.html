  Maria
 </strong>
 : Any habits you&#39;d like to change?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I would like to change my habits of buying bad food and drinks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Oh, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s so easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : So dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : And especially when you&#39;re at university and they only sell the bad stuff because it&#39;s just so much easier to do than to cook a good meal. I&#39;m a pretty good cook.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : I noticed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Thank you. My mother taught me to cook well but I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know, sometimes I just
  <span class="audionotes">
   cannot be bothered
  </span>
  so I wish I had the habit of just always being much better with my food. That would help with the weight as well. What else? Habits, habits? I have some bad habits that I would like to change. I have the bad habit of having to sleep with a duna, a duvet cover on. I have to have something like heavy otherwise I can&#39;t sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Why do you see that as a bad habit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Because in summer, I have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   crank the air conditioning up
  </span>
  to really, really high so as a result you know I end up wasting electricity so easy. I wish I had the habit of turning my computer off as well. I leave it on all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : So you&#39;re an electricity waster?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, sorry, sorry world. Where is it the islands are flooding in the South Pacific?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s all my fault. So yeah, turning lights off, remembering my key would be good. I always forget my key. I actually thought I lost my key the other day and nearly had
  <span class="audionotes">
   a coniption fit
  </span>
  so yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Drinking habits, any good, any bad?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Drinking? Alcohol?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : That was the point.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I get too excited too quickly and just want to go dancing but the good thing about the dancing is that then you don&#39;t drink alcohol because
  <span class="audionotes">
   at a certain point
  </span>
  you have to drink water.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Do you know what I mean? So like I
  <span class="audionotes">
   don&#39;t go too far off the deep end
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : You can&#39;t really drink anything when you&#39;re dancing then you spill it all over the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, so that helps I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : That does help.
