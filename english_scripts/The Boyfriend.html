  </strong>
  OK, Tara, why don&#39;t you tell us about your
  <span class="audiodef">
   first boyfriend

 <p>
  <strong>
   Tara:
  </strong>
  OK, my first boyfriend, I met in my hometown. He&#39;s called Barry. He&#39;s my first real boyfriend. Yeah, I met him at a bar. Yeah, I had a bit of a
  <span class="audiodef">
   crush
  </span>
  on him when I was younger and then, yeah, we met a club one night and it
  <span class="audiodef">
   carried on
  </span>
  from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s nice. So what was it about Barry that attracted him to you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tara:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s very good looking. He&#39;s tall and he had a beard. I like beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Beards, really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tara:
  </strong>
  I like beards. I don&#39;t know why.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Short beard or long beard?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tara:
  </strong>
  No, no short. I just like
  <span class="audiodef">
   stubble
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Are you still in contact with him?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tara:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. At the moment he&#39;s traveling. He&#39;s in India but, we&#39;re so young, so we often like, separate to go traveling , and then get back together again, because I&#39;m only 24 and he&#39;s twenty five, and we have a
  <span class="audiodef">
   serious relationship
  </span>
  but, we don&#39;t wanna, you know, stop doing our own things in life.
