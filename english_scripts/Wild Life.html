  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Asako, we are talking about your time in Alaska. Now you are from a major city in Japan, correct?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. Nagoya.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Nagoya is a very big city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Very big. Two million people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what was it like going from a big city in Japan to
  <span class="audionotes">
   way out in the wilderness
  </span>
  in Alaska?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Do you know what? A lot of people think I had problems, many problems, but actually I did not. I just loved it. I did not have any problems.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So maybe,
  <span class="audionotes">
   by nature
  </span>
  , you are actually more of a nature person.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Exactly. So when... actually when I had problems, was when I came back to Japan, back to the big city in Nagoya. Then I had a lot of problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You missed the wilderness?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  I missed silence. Quiet. I... just too many, too many sounds in the city. Even when you&#39;re sitting in your room, you still hear some sort of sounds, noise, surrounded by some sort of noise all the time, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   I just couldn&#39;t stand it.
  </span>
  It took me a long time to get used to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know that&#39;s kind of interesting because I grew up in a small town and then I moved and I lived some major cities: London, you know, Tokyo, and I lived in Bangkok and when I would come home from being in Bangkok, Thailand, I was so used to having people around all the time, it was really hard to have too much space.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It was too much, like
  <span class="audionotes">
   I missed having action and noise
  </span>
  around me all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  So you are a city person?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know, it&#39;s funny,
  <span class="audionotes">
   oddly enough
  </span>
  , I grew up on a farm and in a small town and I actually think, Yes, I am more of a city person.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maybe it us just the difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Maybe so. Maybe. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So would you like to move back to Alaska some day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  I would love to. It could be a little difficult because it&#39;s very cold in the winter. But I would love to. I miss nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now do you do the really rough, Alaskan things, like hunting, fishing, things like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  I have tried. I couldn&#39;t catch any.... well, fish yes, but I couldn&#39;t shoot anything, but I tried.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You tried to shoot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Shoot. I did.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You didn&#39;t hit anything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  I didn&#39;t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  I was really bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I am sure, out there, there&#39;s some animal that&#39;s very thankful you&#39;re not good at hunting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sure they were.
