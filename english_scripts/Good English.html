   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Christian, you&#39;re English is amazing. Perfect actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  Thank you.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And many people from Norway have excellent English. What is the secret about Norway?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. I actually heard that before that I meet a lot of people and they say,&#34;Oh, you&#39;re from Norway. Norwegian people speak such good English. Why is that?&#34;
  <span class="audiodef">
   Personally
  </span>
  I think it&#39;s because we get a lot of
  <span class="audiodef">
   exposure
  </span>
  to English, through TV, music, media, everything, and we don&#39;t
  <span class="audiodef">
   dub
  </span>
  movies and TV programs like they do in many other countries. We get
  <span class="audiodef">
   subtitles
  </span>
  . And the same with music. English music is very, very popular. Probably more popular that Norwegian music, and I guess as well the education system provides us with really good, you know, teaching so, I mean all those combined together, you know, creates, how to say.
 </p>

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Super speakers!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know super speakers. It&#39;s a good combination, I guess in term of learning the language, so, you know, and a lot of Norwegians travel as well and they have time to practice as well, which is important if you want to speak English well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sure, well, how difficult is it to learn Norwegian?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  That is probably more difficult that English, I&#39;d say, but it&#39;s interesting I have a private Japanese student at the moment and he went to Norway on exchange from his university here in Japan and he didn&#39;t speak a word of Norwegian before he went but he spent the year there, and he now can have a
  <span class="audiodef">
   decent
  </span>
  conversation with me in Norwegian. That&#39;s three years ago since he went there, but still he speaks pretty well.
