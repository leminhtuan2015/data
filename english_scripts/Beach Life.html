  What is your hobby?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  I suppose it is scuba diving?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice! Well, tell us about scuba diving.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Well, I haven&#39;t been for awhile because I have been living in Japan and it&#39;s expensive to do it here, but when I was in Thailand I went scuba diving
  <span class="audiodef">
   quite a lot
  </span>
  . I did the PADI certificate. I just love it. I did
  <span class="audiodef">
   quite a bit
  </span>
  of scuba diving both in the Gulf of Thailand and the Indian Ocean and saw whale sharks, leopard sharks and
  <span class="audiodef">
   all sorts of things
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How do they compare, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf o

  iland?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Well, the Gulf of Thailand is quite
  <span class="audiodef">
   polluted
  </span>
  and there is a lot of shipping thatcomes up from Singapore to Bangkok, whereas the Indian Ocean, it&#39;s called the AndamanSea but it&#39;s part of the Indian Ocean is a lot cleaner but it can be
  <span class="audiodef">
   affected by
  </span>
  monsoons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Great. Thanks Matt.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Trevor, do you like the beach?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  I love the beach. The beach is great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Why do you love the beach?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s nice fresh air, beautiful water, you can play in the sand, and my
  <span class="audiodef">
   hobby
  </span>
  is surfing, so I like to go surfing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh..nice. How often do you go surfing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  I try to go as often as possible, usually every weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. When do you go to the beach? Saturday? Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  Usually early on a Saturday morning. Try to
  <span class="audiodef">
   beat
  </span>
  the crowds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What do you do at the beach
  <span class="audiodef">
   besides
  </span>
  surfing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  Oh, just relax on the sand, watch the people, maybe have a swim, throw a frisbee.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  Things like that!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How long have you been surfing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  Since I was ten years old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, since you were ten. That&#39;s great! -- What do you take to the beach, when you go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  A towel, and my hat, my
  <span class="audiodef">
   sunscreen
  </span>
  , my surfboard, wetsuit, some food and water, and maybe a radio.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Now, you are from Australia. How are the beaches
  <br>
  different in Australia than Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  The beaches are much bigger and white sand, clean water, very nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Well, sounds good. Thanks a lot Trevor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Trevor:
  </strong>
  OK.
  <span class="audiodef">
