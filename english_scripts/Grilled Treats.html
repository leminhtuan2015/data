 : So for the Satay you can have beef, chicken, liver, mutton. Now, people might not know what mutton is. What is mutton?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Mutton is a lamb’s meat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Lamb’s meat. Or sheep’s meat.

  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Sheep’s meat, yeah. And it’s… well actually,
  <span class="audionotes">
   personally
  </span>
  that is the meat that I most like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh really, that’s your favorite?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah it’s my favorite. It tastes like different and just… if I find a juicy one and it’s
  <span class="audionotes">
   my wonder of the world
  </span>
  maybe. It’s really hard to find it anywhere else outside of Indonesia maybe because
  <span class="audionotes">
   lack of lambs
  </span>
  ? I don’t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  So once I find one I really
  <span class="audionotes">
   cherish that moment
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now in your city, is it common for people to eat in street stalls?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yes, we have lots of hawkers in Jakarta. I mean, you can find meat ball sellers, you can find any street smoking vender shops and then you can find any… yeah, you can eat Nasi Goreng or Mi Goreng in the road also. Like maybe, well usually, when there’s a traffic jam
  <span class="audionotes">
   going on
  </span>
  , usually when you can find some hawkers you can just “Hey, I want Nasi Goreng”, they just go get and give it to us and you can eat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  From your car, you call to the people and they bring you the food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah they bring you the food. Or maybe sometimes we just park in anywhere and then if you see a hawker that sells Nasi Goreng you can just order and you can eat in there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that’s pretty cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so it’s anywhere, basically, you can eat anywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I think I would gain a lot of weight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so…
