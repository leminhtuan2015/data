  OK, John could you tell us about your wedding day?
 </p>

  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Sure, I got married about two years ago on May 18th. I got married in my wife&#39;s parents backyard. They have a really beautiful backyard, with a pool and it&#39;s nicely landscaped, with lots of nice flowers and bushes and trees. It was a kind of a small wedding we only had about 30 to 50 people there, all close friends of the family, and a few family members who I hadn&#39;t seen in a few years who were able to make it, but it was a pretty small affair and we had the food catered, some seafood and some meat, steak, type items, and it was a beautiful outdoor wedding.

  The actual ceremony only lasted about 15, 20 minutes. I cried, when I was supposed to like, deliver my lines. I cried and everyone told me afterwards, they were like, &#34; I couldn&#39;t hear a word you were saying because you were crying, right!&#34; and I was trying not to talk loud cause the louder I got the louder my crying noises got, so I was like &#34;Ah, mmm, will you merry me?&#34;, just real quiet. But other than that it went pretty smooth.
