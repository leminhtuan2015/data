Oil prices reached a six-month high on Tuesday after the Trump administration announced it would no longer exempt countries from U.S. sanctions if they continue to buy Iranian crude oil.  It's a move aimed at imposing a complete oil embargo on Iran.

The European Union is joining those criticizing the U.S. decision to impose the sanctions.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports.
<br><br>
Since President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and announced sanctions on importers of Iranian oil, the European Union has put measures in place to sidestep those sanctions, including a way to keep financial supply lines to Tehran open and protect European businesses operating there.
<br><br>
The European Commission spokeswoman today expressed regret over the U.S. decision to remove any exemptions to those sanctions, saying it risks further undermining the international effort to stop Iran developing nuclear weapons.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the move has sent global oil prices climbing.
