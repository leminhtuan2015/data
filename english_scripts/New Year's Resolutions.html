  Fred:
 </strong>
 Hi, Sabriya. So tell me, in Oman do you guys have the same culture, the same traditions as we do? Do you celebrate New Year&#39;s?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Yes, we do. It&#39;s not one of the big events known in Oman but we do celebrate New Year and we follow the same calendar
  <span class="audionotes">
   as you guys
  </span>
  do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Oh, is that right? So, as New Year&#39;s is almost coming soon, do you have any New Year&#39;s Resolution?

  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Well, for the past maybe three or four years I&#39;ve been trying to have different
  <span class="audionotes">
   resolutions
  </span>
  but I never manage to
  <span class="audionotes">
   stick to them
  </span>
  or keep them. However, this year, I think I&#39;ve
  <span class="audionotes">
   made my mind
  </span>
  up on a resolution which I plan to keep and that is to limit or actually lessen my phone bill.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Lessen your phone bill. Wow. I can&#39;t imagine how big the phone bill was before if you want to change it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Oh, my goodness it was so big. I mean, you know, you know how much I love talking on the phone so, yes, it was quite big and I intend to, you know, discipline myself a lot more. So what about you Fred?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  What about my New Year&#39;s Resolution?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Wow! My New Year&#39;s resolution... I would say more my New Year&#39;s resolutions. I have many, but I think I have to focus on one or two of them to make it happen, so number one, I think as many people out there, I would like to quit smoking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Good for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Thank you very much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Good for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Will you support me?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  Definitely. No doubt about it. I will personally support you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Thank you very much for all your support. I think it&#39;s gonna be very good for me. Not only because this is bad for my health, but you know, it&#39;s just something that I think will give me a lot of confidence if I&#39;m able to to do this, to quit. I will say I am strong and confident in myself and I can do this. Now, my other New Year&#39;s resolution would be... I love my grandmother so much, but as I don&#39;t live close to her anymore, I feel that I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   losing a bit
  </span>
  in my relationship with her, and so I would like to call her every week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  That is very sweet. That is so cute. I think that&#39;s something we should all have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Thank you very much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sabriya:
  </strong>
  To have grandmothers and mothers and call them all the time.
