   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Barbara, we&#39;re talking about your time in the hospital. You were in the hospital for sometime. First of all, how long were you actually in the hospital?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  Well, I was in two hospitals actually. At first, I was in a big hospital for three and a half weeks and I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   on a drip
  </span>
  for all of that time, and they didn&#39;t let me eat anything, and the first couple of days, they also didn&#39;t let me drink anything.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Whoa!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you were on a drip… I&#39;m sorry, how long?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  Three and a half weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Whoa! No
  <span class="audionotes">
   solid food
  </span>
  for three and a half weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  No food for three and a half weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I was dreaming about my mother&#39;s cooking, and I was dreaming about roast chicken and roast lamb and man, the smells and the tastes
  <span class="audionotes">
   came back to me
  </span>
  , but there was no food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But after like, say two weeks or something, does your body just
  <span class="audionotes">
   get used to
  </span>
  not having food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yes, it does. Definitely. And I lost a lot of weight, but actually I felt fine. Friends who came to visit me in the hospital were surprised and they were like, “Wow! Where&#39;s the rest of you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You did lose a lot of weight. Actually, how much weight did you lose?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  I lost, well, I started losing weight because I was changing my diet just before I got ill. In the last eighteen months, I&#39;ve lost twenty kilos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Whoa! That&#39;s a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  That is, indeed, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Twenty kilos… Wow! Well, you look great. You must feel great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Barbara:
  </strong>
  I feel much better. Actually I think sick with that was probably a good thing. It made me
  <span class="audionotes">
   take stock
  </span>
  and reevaluate things and get healthy.
