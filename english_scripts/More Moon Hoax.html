  : Jonathan we are talking about
  <span class="audionotes">
   conspiracy theories
  </span>
  . What about the one where the sound? That when the rocket lands, they have actually audio of the rocket landing and you can&#39;t hear the rocket engine, and the rocket engine should be making a really loud noise?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve heard that one before. I would think that perhaps though the engine might be situated in such a location that the noise is being
  <span class="audionotes">
   dispersed
  </span>
  out into open space.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you&#39;re saying that because in space there&#39;s no pressure. There&#39;s nothing for the sounds to bounce off of so it would just be silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  I mean, people have grown up watching movies like Star Wars and they think that when spaceships go through outer space that they go &#34;vooooom&#34; as they travel. The reality is that there is no sound in space. You know, there are no lasers that go &#34;tchoo tchoo tchoo&#34; as they go from one ship to another. It makes great entertainment. It doesn&#39;t make great science.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Fair enough
  </span>
  . What about the buggy? Some people say that they buggy is going
  <span class="audionotes">
   slow-mo
  </span>
  . That maybe they filmed it in Area 51?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Yes, I&#39;ve read about this. That apparently if you speed up the footage to a certain point that it looks as if they are walking around normally and such, but the think is that when you take into account the gravitational pull, they&#39;ve sped it up too much for it to be realistic. I don&#39;t remember the
  <span class="audionotes">
   exact figures
  </span>
  but it&#39;s something like if you speed it up to and a half times instead of three and a half times as the conspiracy theorists did then it looks completely natural, that like they&#39;re on the surface of the moon.
