  Tu:
 </strong>
 Do you travel by car in Iran?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Well, you know, when I was in Iran it was just like your case. I felt like this is natural. This is how I saw the traffic. This was how it is supposed to work. When you go abroad, and like me right now, I&#39;m living abroad, then I go back to Iran, I cannot drive with the flows again just like before. It is very difficult for me. At first, I become very much like foreigners and get mad at every mistake, you know, every
  <span class="audionotes">
   illegal moves
  </span>
  you know, other Iranians are doing, so but after awhile
  <span class="audionotes">
   I get the hang of it
  </span>
  , so then I learn how to really my get work done.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, one more thing is how do people cross the road in Iran?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, the government has built very good
  <span class="audionotes">
   infrastructure
  </span>
  , so we have this, you know, this pass-way that you can walk, you know, and cross the streets, but well, it really depends on how much these roads are now implemented, and how people really feel like ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Following it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Following it. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, one thing in Vietnam, one thing typical to Vietnamese traffic is people cross the road anyway they want.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  We don&#39;t go with them. Yeah, what do you call it? The white one? The zebra? Like the crossing line? We don&#39;t cross?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Ah, crosswalk!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yep, that one. We don&#39;t cross the road there. We just cross the road whenever we want and wherever we want.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see. So what happens in case of an accident, if the car hits a passerby?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  You know, actually,
  <span class="audionotes">
   one of the amazing things
  </span>
  is we never got hit by that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Never?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  And foreigners look amazed at it. Like, they just can&#39;t believe it. They just don&#39;t know why? How come people cross the road without ... but actually we just look slowly, slowly, one-by-one, and we even cross in front of a car. It&#39;s pretty normal for us. It&#39;s easy though if
  <span class="style10">
   <span class="audionotes">
    you get used to it
   </span>
  </span>
