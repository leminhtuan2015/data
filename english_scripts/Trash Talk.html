   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Keiko, so you lived in The States and they have a different system of collecting trash. Can you explain the difference of collecting trash in America and collecting trash in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  OK, my personal experience, in The States you just put everything in one place whereas in Japan you have to divide it into five different places but actually where I live in Kawasaki it&#39;s actually quite easy so I only have to divide into two garbage: one
  <span class="audionotes">
   burnable
  </span>
  , the other one non-burnable.That&#39;s it, but in the states, you just put everything together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, it&#39;s really weird cause when I go home and I have trash I
  <span class="audionotes">
   feel guilty
  </span>
  . There&#39;s two things I feel strange about: One is in Japan I take off my shoes, when I go home, in America I feel strange walking in a house with my shoes on and the other is trash. When I go to throw away trash, I&#39;m just throwing it away and I don&#39;t have to put in the right
  <span class="audionotes">
   bin
  </span>
  . It always feels a little strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  But that means that somebody&#39;s -- at the end, somebody is doing all the dividing work in The States, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know. I think maybe some communities but maybe a lot, they just bury it. I think in The States, cause we have a lot more land, we just
  <span class="audionotes">
   bury
  </span>
  a lot of the trash. We don&#39;t burn it like you do in Japan, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  You were saying that in Japan, it&#39;s different from region to region how you separate trash.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keiko:
  </strong>
  I think Tokyo is really strict, whereas Kanagawa is a little bit easy and I don&#39;t know why but I have to be even more careful when I&#39;m at work, so even when I&#39;m busy, I eat my lunch, you know, I take out my lunch garbage and I have to put, you know, chopstick here, a plastic box here, and a plastic bag here, and yeah, it&#39;s quite, quite a work
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I hear ya. OK. Thanks a lot Keiko.
