   Hello, and welcome to our show.
   <br>
   Today, we’ll be making one of my favourite recipes.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   It’s called the egg spaghetti.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   First, what you will need for this recipe is:
   <br>
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   About a hundred grams of dried spaghetti,
   <br>
   Two table spoons of olive oil,
   <br>
   Fifty grams of minced meat,
   <br>
   About a half of a medium onion,
   <br>
   Half a cup of chopped mushrooms,
   <br>
   One cup of tomato sauce, or peeled crushed tomatoes
   <br>
   (I prefer peeled crushed tomatoes)
   <br>
   And lastly, you will need one egg.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   First, let your water come to a boil, and boil your dried spaghetti.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   While you are waiting for your spaghetti to boil, you can prepare your sauce.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   Heat up the pan with the olive oil, and add the minced meat.
   <br>
   Brown the minced meat until it gets nice and brown.
   <br>
   Lower the heat to about medium heat, and then add your chopped onions.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   It’s important to fry your onions in lower heat so that you can let it caramelize. It’ll take a while but it will be worth the effort, because all of the sugars will come out of the onion and bring a nice sweat taste to your sauce.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   Then, add your mushrooms (your chopped mushrooms), and keep stirring it around until it gets nice and tender.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   And then lastly, you can add your tomato sauce, or peeled crushed tomatoes.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   And let it simmer for a bit until it gets nice and warm.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   Your spaghetti should be ready by now. So you can drain the water out and add a bit of olive oil to your spaghetti, so that it won’t stick. Put your spaghetti on a plate, and then pour some of your sauce on top.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   Now, you can fry your egg on a pan sunny-side-up. I like to leave the yolk nice and soft. And then put the fried egg on top of your spaghetti. Now, when you eat your spaghetti, I like to pierce the egg with a fork so that all the yolk drizzles out and becomes a part of the sauce. The egg is quite alkaline, so it brings a nice mild taste that counteracts with the acidic tomato.

   And enjoy!
