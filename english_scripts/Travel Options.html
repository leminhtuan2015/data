   Todd:
  </strong>
  Could you talk about, when you travel, do you prefer to travel with somebody to travel alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I prefer to travel with someone but on my next trip I&#39;m actually traveling alone so I&#39;m looking forward to seeing whether I enjoy myself. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So this will be the first time you&#39;ve travelled alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  It will be the first trip where I actually plan the whole trip by myself. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, next. When you travel do you like to follow a guide book or do you like to explore and just do things without any planning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I tend to be on a
  <span class="audionotes">
   time budget
  </span>
  so I do use guidebooks and in general it will be the
  <span class="audionotes">
   Lonely Planet
  </span>
  - the same as everybody else.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You go to the same places as everybody else.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I guess that&#39;s just how it normally works... OK When you travel do you usually like to go on a budget for a long time or do you like to spend a little money and have more of a good time and a shorter vacation?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Definitely I prefer to be on a budget and have much longer time. Yeah, and I think on a budget that you
  <span class="audionotes">
   experience the culture
  </span>
  better as well, so I think it&#39;s better all around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now when you travel what are some things you do to save money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I
  <span class="audionotes">
   cut down
  </span>
  on alcohol.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Because that&#39;s usually a big expense and I shop at supermarkets and tend to, try not to eat in restaurant so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and the last one is when you travel to you try to stay away from other tourists and travelers or do you like to meet other people as you travel?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I like to spend time away from other tourists but I find that that&#39;s often difficult and for example in a place like Machu Pichu there are
  <span class="audionotes">
   thousands and thousands
  </span>
  other tourists and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it.
