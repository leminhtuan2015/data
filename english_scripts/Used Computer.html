  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Mark, I heard that you might be interested in buying a computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. Yeah, I&#39;m interested in buying a Mac computer because I&#39;ve never used Mac before.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   that is actually perfect
  </span>
  because I have two MacIntosh laptops and I&#39;m selling one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re kidding.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  How much?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;ll sell it to you for 20,000 Japanese yen, so that&#39;s almost 200 dollars. That&#39;s a pretty good deal. But there&#39;s a problem with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s the problem?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The problem is the disc drive is broken, so sometimes if you put a DVD into the disc drive it doesn&#39;t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn&#39;t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s not too bad because I have another computer that I can watch DVD&#39;s on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  How long have you had it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve had it for about three years, and it works great, like it&#39;s great for the internet. It&#39;s great for lots of things. I just unfortunately
  <span class="audionotes">
   accidentally
  </span>
  broke the DVD because I had a problem. I couldn&#39;t get a DVD out and I
  <span class="audionotes">
   foolishly
  </span>
  tried to get it out the wrong way, so but it still works. There is one other problem. It has a power cord and I lost the original power cord for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right, OK, so I need to buy a new power cord.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You need to buy a new one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  And how much will that
  <span class="audionotes">
   set me back
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That will probably cost you about 6,000 yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  6,000 yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so it&#39;s not too bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  So that new Mac that you got over there, how much was that new?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  If you buy it new, well this is an older edition, but now they&#39;re about 100,000 yen. They&#39;re actually quite a good deal. That&#39;s why I&#39;m selling it so cheap because you can buy a new Mac for pretty cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right. OK. Sounds a good deal. Can I build websites on that one?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. You can pretty much do anything. It has a lot of capabilities. It&#39;s very easy, and if you like the TV show the Sopranos, I&#39;ll throw in a bunch of DVD&#39;s as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you can watch them for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right, so 20,000 yen and how many DVD&#39;s?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, there is a set of four so there&#39;s probably,  I don&#39;t know, there&#39;s four DVD&#39;s but there&#39;s probably 18 episodes of the show the Sopranos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a good show.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  OK. That sounds like
  <span class="audionotes">
   we may have a deal
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Let me talk to the girlfriend about it. See if she wants to buy a Mac because it&#39;s her money, too. Maybe I need to borrow some money off her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  And then we can do the deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, sounds good. Alright, thanks Mark.
 </p>
