  Anja:
 </strong>
 So, Fred, tell me, how is it on Christmas? Who do you give gifts to in Canada?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Well, Anja, personally I prefer to receive gifts. That&#39;s always funner. Yeah, well, of course, we give gifts and we receive gifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah. So the gifts, how are they? Are they really expensive or...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Good question. Well, I don&#39;t know. It depends on who you&#39;re giving the gift to, and it also depends on, you know, how many gifts you have to buy.

  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, so, who exactly are you buying gifts for? Only the really.... people that are really
  <span class="audionotes">
   close to you
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Well, yes, I would say that in my case I have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   large family
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  How many are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  We are six siblings: six brothers and sisters and plus my parents and both my grandparents are still alive, and aunts and cousins and so a very big family, and so what we do is we
  <span class="audionotes">
   exchange gifts
  </span>
  . So we buy a small gift, 45 dollars, and then we play a small game where we exchange that gift amongst each other, so we don&#39;t have to buy gifts to everybody.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s quite nice, so it won&#39;t get too expensive, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  It won&#39;t but, personally, I like to buy gifts for my mother or my father and especially my grandmother and grandfather. It&#39;s very important, and so I enjoy doing the shopping for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, you do like shopping?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  For Christmas it&#39;s something different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s really difficult on Christmas, right? Usually, the shops are really
  <span class="audionotes">
   packed
  </span>
  and there&#39;s so many people. It&#39;s really stressful, isn&#39;t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but I like that
  <span class="audionotes">
   stress
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I love it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. I think you are the only one.
