 Yogurt is a healthy food that can be made at home. One way to make it is to first buy some yogurt from a store or purchase dry yogurt culture. Add two small spoonfuls of the yogurt to two cups of milk. This will be the starter for your own yogurt. A cup in the United States is two hundred forty milliliters.
</p>
<p>
 When making yogurt, it is very important to have clean equipment, clean hands and good temperature control.
</p>
<p>
 Pour eight cups of milk into a large cooking pot. Heat the milk to eighty-five degrees Celsius. Then cool the milk quickly to forty-three degrees. To do this, you can put the cooking pot in cool water.
</p>
<p>
 Keep the yogurt at forty-three degrees and add one-half cup of the starter. The remaining starter can be kept for later use. If you want a thicker yogurt, you can also add one-third of a cup of dry milk.
</p>
<p>
 Cover the pot and keep it at a temperature of forty to forty-five degrees Celsius for four to six hours. After that, your homemade yogurt is ready. It can be left at room temperature for up to twelve hours if you like a stronger taste.
</p>
<p>
 You can add fruit, nuts, honey or spices.
</p>
<p>
 Yogurt can be made with milk from cows or other animals including goats, sheep, water buffalo and camels. It can be spelled y-o-g-u-r-t or y-o-g-h-u-r-t.Â  More information on yogurt making can be found at Web sites such as practicalanswers.org.

 Now, from yogurt, we move on to another ancient and related food -- cheese.
</p>
<p>
 Parmigiano-Reggiano is the king of Italy&#39;s cheeses. People worldwide use it on pasta and other foods. The traditional Italian cheese is produced on several hundred farms around the northern city of Parma.
</p>
<p>
 Cheese makers age it for at least twelve months in large rounds called wheels.
</p>
<p>
 Parmigiano-Reggiano producers say now they are struggling with the financial crisis. Sales of the cheese and a lower-priced version, Grana Padano, are down in Italy. Prices for producers have dropped. And low-priced copies are on the market.
</p>
<p>
 Now comes a rescue plan for the industry. Italy&#39;s government has made available enough money to buy two hundred thousand wheels of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Charitable organizations then will give the cheese -- more than sixty million dollars&#39; worth -- to poor people.
