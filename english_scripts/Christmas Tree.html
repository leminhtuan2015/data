 Anja, so
 <span class="audionotes">
  what&#39;s it like
 </span>
 to decorate your Christmas tree in Switzerland?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Ah, Christmas tree! Oh, that&#39;s so nice, right? Like, I remember in my family, you know, we have the special, like space in our house just for the Christmas tree, just for Christmas time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  A special space for the Christmas tree!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, indeed! And I remember I always went with my parents to buy the Christmas tree, maybe, three days before Christmas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  OK, three days before.

  </strong>
  Yes, and we wouldn&#39;t put it actually until Christmas day, like I remember how me and my mother and the rest of my family, we went to church and then we would come back. My father wouldn&#39;t go to church and the door would be closed and then we open the door and suddenly there would be the Christmas tree. So actually, you know, like, I never knew that my father actually put the Christmas tree. Of course, it was like some angel or
  <span class="audionotes">
   something like that
  </span>
  , but actually I never decorated the Christmas tree because an angel was doing that for us... as in my father.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  So when you were a young child, you always thought that some kind of angel would come down to your house and decorate your Christmas tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. During the time I was in church, and did it for us. And it&#39;s really pretty, and it has a lot of lights and it&#39;s really colorful. You know some people like it one specific color: in red or blue, but our Christmas tree always had a lot of different colors. It&#39;s really nice. What about you? How is your Christmas tree like in your family?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Ah, it&#39;s just great. It&#39;s a bit different because the whole family would gather and then
  <span class="audionotes">
   put up
  </span>
  the Christmas tree together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  We would decorate the Christmas tree together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Maybe too or three days before Christmas, we would all go to the store or just use what we already had and then we would all gather together and put up the Christmas tree together listening to Frank Sinatra&#39;s best Christmas songs, and actually, the size of the Christmas tree was the most interesting part.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, is it? Is it really big or...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  It was a really, really big Christmas tree, and my father used to love those big Christmas trees and then it would
  <span class="audionotes">
   take so much time
  </span>
  to decorate it. Think about a fifteen foot Christmas tree,
  <span class="audionotes">
   how much time
  </span>
  you have to spend to decorate it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow that&#39;s a tall tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but it&#39;s a lot of fun.
