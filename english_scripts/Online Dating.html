   Jonathan:

  So, Jeff, you know, I don&#39;t know if I want go out to the pub again on Saturday. LIke the music is a little bit too loud. It&#39;s hard to meet people and so on. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve been thinking, we should do like some online dating. You know, try to meet some women that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  What do you mean? We just sit at home and through the computer. Or how do you do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  No, you don&#39;t have a date through the computer. That would be awful. But, you know, in the modern world people are
  <span class="audionotes">
   rushed
  </span>
  . They always don&#39;t have time to go out and meet people. If you only go to bars, to try to meet people, you&#39;re only meeting a small percentage of the population: the people who do like to go out and drink and have fun, and so on. You&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   cutting yourself off
  </span>
  from a lot of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So how does this work, this online dating? Do I have to pay to use this site?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Oh, there are some sites where you pay and some where you don&#39;t. You can put up a profile of yourself, you know, with a picture if you like, or perhaps you would like to stay more
  <span class="audionotes">
   anonymous
  </span>
  and not put your picture up. You can see a lot of basic information about people even before you&#39;re ever in contact with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So, if I&#39;m living in a city, do I look for dates or women only in that city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Well, most of them have search critereas. You can choose within say twenty kilometers or a hundred kilometers. Anyway where in the world if you like? You don&#39;t always find love
  <span class="audionotes">
   just around the corner
  </span>
  . You might find you have a heck of a lot in common with somebody
  <span class="audionotes">
   on the other side of
  </span>
  the world. But with online dating, people put up some information that they are comfortable sharing, so you can see what somebody does in their free time, what somebody&#39;s beliefs are, what somebody is interested in finding, so you may find by doing the search that you meet someone that really matches up with you that you would be interested in contacting without ever going out to the bar, or if you just go out and hit the bar, you may feel a one in a million shot to meet the right person, whereas online, maybe you can search a million people and you find that right one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Online dating. That sounds great. I&#39;m gonna give it a go.
