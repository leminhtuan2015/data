   Marion:
  </strong>
  So you lived in Dublin for awhile, didn&#39;t you Mauve? What&#39;s life like in Dublin?
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="style3">
   Mauve:
  </span>
  I think life in Dublin is very different from everywhere else in the country. It&#39;s the biggest city in Ireland. It&#39;s got a population of about a million I think, even though the population of Ireland is only 4 million,
  <br>
  so most people...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  So it&#39;s a quarter of the whole population.
 </p>
 <p>

   </a>
   Mauve:
  </strong>
  Exactly. It&#39;s a very young population, I think, the Dublin population, I suppose like all cities there&#39;s plenty to do, in terms of cinemas, theatres, I don&#39;t know, you know whatever else, comedy club and all that kind of, plenty of night clubs, loads of restaurants. It&#39;s very international now, at the moment I suppose, like there&#39;s Japanese restaurants, and well there&#39;s always Indian and Chinese, and there&#39;s like, I don&#39;t know, French and Spanish, and every type of restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  So it&#39;s kind of a cosmopolitan city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="style3">
   Mauve:
  </span>
  Yeah, exactly
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  Or big by Irish standards, I suppose. Yeah, it&#39;s probably like a village for other people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="style3">
   Mauve:
  </span>
  I know. Even though when I went to New York then, in June, it wasn&#39;t such a culture shock, cause even though, there are high rise buildings and every thing but it wasn&#39;t that different though. You know, I think that Dublin has come on a lot and it&#39;s by no means rural anymore, you know, in comparison to other cities in Ireland, like Cork and Gaul, we&#39;re very rural, but, I don&#39;t think Dublin is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think Dublin is like an international city, and it can stand on it&#39;s own.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="style3">
   Mauve:
  </span>
  Definitely, yeah, you can compare to London or, you know, New York.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  And the standard of, like the cost of living, is very high in Dublin, though, isn&#39;t it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="style3">
   Mauve:
  </span>
  Yeah, it is. Rents are much higher there. It&#39;s more expensive to eat out and I suppose to do everything really. You need a good salary to live in Dublin I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="style3">
   Mauve:
  </span>
  Big bucks!
 </p>
