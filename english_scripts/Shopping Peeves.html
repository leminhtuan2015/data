  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Rebecca, we&#39;re talking about shopping. Is there anything you don&#39;t like about shopping?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes, I don&#39;t like shopping when they&#39;re crowds of people. Usually when the sales are on, it can be a good time to shop because there&#39;s sales but it also
  <span class="audionotes">
   draws a lot people
  </span>
  and everybody&#39;s pushing and trying to get the clothes they want that are on special. Yeah, I don&#39;t like that.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right. Actually, the thing I really don&#39;t like about shopping is having - or clothes shopping - is having to try on clothes. You know, like, you go and you find your size and then you put it on and then it doesn&#39;t fit, then you have to try it on again and it&#39;s just,
  <span class="audionotes">
   it takes forever
  </span>
  . And you look at the numbers and it&#39;s so hard to find the number that fits you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it seems every year the numbers are changing sizes. You wear a size ten and then the next year it&#39;s not that size so. Yeah. That can be a real problem, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   It drives me nuts
  </span>
  . Now in Australia, when you go shopping in the store, do you normally get a lot of personal customer service?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes. Yes. They tend to come up to you as soon as you come into the store, and if you say you&#39;re browsing then
  <span class="audionotes">
   they leave you alone
  </span>
  but it can be really good, the shops I shop at. They do help you with the fitting sizes and when you&#39;re in the change rooms, you can just say, &#34;No, I need a new size&#34; and they will go and get it for you,
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, in the States I think the service is really good as well, but what&#39;s really annoying is that now they always want to have you join some club or some membership.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   The points cards
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so you just want to buy your shirt and they ask you, &#34;Would you like a credit card?&#34; or &#34;Would you like a discount card or membership?&#34;
  <span class="style6">
   I can&#39;t stand it
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I know. I think I have so many cards in my wallet, and they&#39;re like, &#34;Oh, are you a member?&#34; and I pull out all my cards and I&#39;m not a member so they
  <span class="audionotes">
   join me up
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right. Usually these days I just say no, but it&#39;s just so annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it can be. Yes.
