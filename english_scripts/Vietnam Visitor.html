 <strong>
  Tu:
 </strong>
 Hey, Todd, I heard you went to Vietnam. Tell me about it?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was a really good trip.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I went during the break
  </span>
  , and I was only there for seven days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, kind of too short. But I went to Ho Chi Min, and Mui Ne, and Nha Trang, so I saw three cities in seven days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Ho Chi Min - where did you go in Ho Chi Min?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ho Chi Min ... I just stayed downtown, and I didn&#39;t know anything really about the city so I just kind of walked around or I went jogging around the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  How did you feel about it?
  <span class="audionotes">
   The city I mean
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, it was amazing cause there&#39;s just so much energy, so much going on, you know. We&#39;d say it&#39;s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   bustling city
  </span>
  , so you know, there&#39;s those motorbikes everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   that&#39;s foreigner talk
  </span>
  . Motorbikes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
  <span class="audionotes">
   24 hours
  </span>
  , too, it seems like ther&#39;re always going, and there&#39;s lots of nice shops, and the food was really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was really good and really cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Was it cheaper?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, it was incredibly cheap. It was incredibly cheap. I couldn&#39;t believe the first night I had this really good dish with the shrimp and vegetables and it only cost about three or four US dollars, so it was really cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Two dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Did you go to Mui Ne?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I did. I went to Mui Ne and ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  How was it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It was good. I mean, I went there actually to surf. I heard it had really good waves but I was there during the wrong season, I guess, so I didn&#39;t surf, but they had this ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, the waves were just ... there were no waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there were none.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But I saw the sandunes, and I was quite impressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  The sand dunes. Yes, it is Mui Ne famous for.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I mean, it looks like you&#39;re in the Sahara Desert or in Africa.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, they&#39;re so big, and some places, when you stand, all you can see is the sand, like, you can&#39;t see anything else. It&#39;s pretty amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Mm! It looks so beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It is. It is really beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  I love it too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And then the last day, I went to Nha Trang. Am I saying that right? Nha Trang.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Nha Trang.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nha Trang.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Oh , yeah. The famous beach.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yes, and that actually surprised me because Ho Chi Min was very old and very gritty and crowded and Mui Ne was kind of a very small traditional beach village, and then, Nha Trang was like this big city. It&#39;s like Waikiki in Hawaii. It was like a resort.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, it&#39;s very beautiful and like high quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  High quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Exactly. I couldn&#39;t believe it. And I got a really great hotel, right on the beach, over-looking the ocean, third floor for only ten dollars a night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Ten dollars?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Nice price.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, I was very impressed. And you know, the food was good, and it was nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Did you get to go to Hanoi?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I didn&#39;t because I only had seven days, so you&#39;re from Hanoi right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Yes, I&#39;m from Hanoi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I should go there. I did like Vietnam a lot. I do want to go back, so hopefully, I can go back and go to Hanoi next time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Next time I will be your tour guide.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, thanks Tu. That would be great.
 </p>
