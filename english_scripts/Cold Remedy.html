   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, hey, Marion, how are you feeling today?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m realy tired. Kind of, I don&#39;t know, my throat&#39;s really
  <span class="audiodef">
   scratchy
  </span>
  , so maybe I&#39;m
  <span class="audiodef">
   coming down
  </span>
  with something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, no. That&#39;s terrible. Are you taking anything for it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  Actually, I am. I had a private student last night and she told me some wild formula to do. And she asked me to take coca-cola, boil it, add some ginger, and then drink it, however, I&#39;m caffiene
  <span class="audiodef">
   sensitive
  </span>
  so it kept me up pretty much all night, so I&#39;m really tired today.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How did it taste?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  It wasn&#39;t bad. If it was probably mid-afternoon, I would love it, but 11:30 at night it
  <span class="audiodef">
   kept me up
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Are you going to try it again, but maybe in the morning?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  No I think I&#39;m just going to
  <span class="audiodef">
   stick with
  </span>
  the regular cold syrup, and just take that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that stuff tastes terrible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marion:
  </strong>
  It does.
