   Hey, Joel, you got your hair cut.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   You can notice that. I don&#39;t have much hair left. You can
   <span class="audionotes">
    see
   </span>
   that it got cut.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   Yeah, why don&#39;t you
   <span class="audionotes">
    grow it out
   </span>
   ?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Actually, you can&#39;t notice right now cause it&#39;s cut so short but my hair&#39;s curly, so if I let it, and I&#39;m bald on top now, so if grow it out I look like Bozo the clown.

    Tom:
   </strong>
   Did you have long hair before?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Actually in college I had long hair. I grew it out pretty long and then, you know, my hair is really blond. I don&#39;t know if you can tell now. It&#39;s gotten a little bit darker, but it was down to my shoulders and really curly.

   Wow.

    Joel:
   </strong>
   Yeah.

    Tom:
   </strong>
   When did you start losing it?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   I noticed sort of at the end of college, when I had long hair, because it didn&#39;t grow nearly as long in the front. I always wanted it to be really even: long in the front and back, but it was, it grew much faster and much thicker in the back than in the front.

   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   So when it&#39;s all gone, are you going to start
   <span class="audionotes">
    combing it over
   </span>
   ?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   No, I don&#39;t want to have the come over. I, actually, my wife likes bald heads, so I&#39;m lucky, so I just cut it really short.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   <span class="audionotes">
    It&#39;s funny though
   </span>
   . When I was really young, well when I was born, I was bald until I was maybe one years old or so, and I had very thin white straight hair, so it was perfectly straight, until I was about 13 years old, and as soon as I
   <span class="audionotes">
    hit puberty
   </span>
   , &#34;booing&#34;! My hair suddenly got curly, so as a self-conscience young adolescent, that was a but of a shocking experience for my hair to go from straight to curly almost overnight. Yeah.
