  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Julia, let&#39;s talk about types of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, first one, are you a fitness freak?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  A fitness freak? I&#39;m fairly fit but I&#39;m not a freak. No, I&#39;m not a fitness freak, no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you exercise but it&#39;s not like you do it all the time?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  No, and I do some unhealthy stuff as well. I like to drink and I&#39;m a former smoker and yes, no I&#39;m not a fitness freak.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. I think a fitness freak is like somebody who does it, who exercises
  <span class="audionotes">
   compulsively
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I indulge in bad stuff too so no I&#39;m not a fitness freak.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so that leads us to the next question. Are you a party animal?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Not any more. I&#39;m too old now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  When you were younger, you were a party animal?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I think, yeah, that was probably the type that I most fitted into.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nice. I was never a party animal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  No?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;ve always been pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   tame
  </span>
  . I&#39;ve always been pretty tame.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yes, I was pretty wild when I was younger.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you used to drink, smoke, stay up late?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah. All that and more, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Come home in the
  <span class="audionotes">
   wee hours
  </span>
  of the morning?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice, that&#39;s cool. OK, next one would be do you know anybody in your family who&#39;s a couch potato?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Couch potato?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Because I know that you&#39;re not a couch potato.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m not a couch potato, no. My brother sometimes demonstrates couch potato traits.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  He likes to play video games and stuff like that and he&#39;ll spend a lot of time watching movies and so he does spend a lot of time
  <span class="audionotes">
   sedentary
  </span>
  compared to me. He makes me look like a fitness freak, I guess, because he doesn&#39;t do so much exercise.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. And so for people listening a couch potato is somebody who watches a lot of TV and sits on the couch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Spends a lot of time on the couch, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, how about the similar personality trait of the bookworm? Are you a bookworm?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  A bookworm? No, but I think my husband&#39;s probably a bookworm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  He spends a lot of time reading books. He reads very fast so he gets through a lot of books.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s a speed reader?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, he&#39;s a very fast reader and he has to read. He has to have a book with him all the time. He cannot, a waiting room or on a train or any situation where you&#39;ve just got to sit around, he cannot do it if he doesn&#39;t have a book.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. You know I live alone and that&#39;s a terrible trait that I have. I cannot sit and eat and just eat without something to occupy my attention. I have to read or I have to be like watching something on the computer and if I go to a waiting room or anything like that or I&#39;m on a plane I&#39;m the same. I have to have something to read.
  <span class="audionotes">
   It drives me nuts
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You see I can&#39;t read on transport because I get sick. It makes me sick, it makes me
  <span class="audionotes">
   nauseous
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like motion sickness?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah. So I don&#39;t have a habit of reading on a train. A bus or a car, oh my God no, I can&#39;t read. No way but my husband reads everywhere all the time.
