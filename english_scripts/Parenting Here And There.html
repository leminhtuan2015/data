   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you&#39;ve seen
  <span class="audionotes">
   obviously
  </span>
  life in France, family life in France, and now you&#39;ve seen family life in America. Is there any differences?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  Yes, there is a lot of difference about the education is different. The education in France, parents are more strict than here, but yeah, the lifestyle is different, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you say that the parents are more strict in France. Like can you give an example? How are they more strict?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  Like, here it&#39;s rare when parents say &#39;no&#39; to their kids, and they say most of the time &#39;yes&#39; for almost everything. But it&#39;s a good thing. It&#39;s a good thing, too, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you&#39;re saying the kids are
  <span class="audionotes">
   spoiled
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  A little bit, yeah. Sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What about like the daily routines of family life? Is there anything different about the daily routine?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  Here in the U.S. we have a lot of au pairs, and a lot of nannies, and in France the parents - most of the time - one of the parents work, and the other takes care of the kids. And here, in the U.S., I notice that both parents work
  <span class="audionotes">
   all the time
  </span>
  . It&#39;s rare when the parents take care of the kids. They contract a nanny most of the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, now that you&#39;ve been an au pair
  <span class="audionotes">
   for awhile
  </span>
  , would you recommend being an au pair for other people?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sure. Of courses. It&#39;s a very good experience, and it&#39;s very
  <span class="audionotes">
   good for our resume
  </span>
  , for people who want to finish their study, and to find work, and it&#39;s a good way to learn English.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, it was nice talking to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Layla:
  </strong>
  Thank you. You too.
