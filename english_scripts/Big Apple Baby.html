  Todd:
 </strong>
 OK. Hello?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Hi! How you doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   doing pretty good
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s your name?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  My name is Kevin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Kevin. Where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from Pheonix, Arizona.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  In the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, were you born in Phoenix?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Actually, no. I was actually born in New York because my parents
  <span class="audionotes">
   happened to be
  </span>
  living in New York at that time . My father was a Major League baseball player and the year I was born, 1971, he was playing with the Mets in New York City. My birthday is in May, May 25th
  <span class="audionotes">
   to be precise
  </span>
  , and so my mother happened to be with my father in New York because it was baseball season. So I was actually born in New York but I grew up in Phoenix. Phoenix is what I consider to be my home town.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s amazing. Do you remember anything about New York?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yes. Actually, I do have a few memories because we spent probably three years there from the time I was born. Obviously, until I was about two and a half or three years, we spent the summers or the baseball season in New York. We rented a condominium on the second floor and I remember it was right across the street from La Guardia Airport. Of course, when I was a little kid, one and two years old, I used to love
  <span class="audionotes">
   sitting by
  </span>
  the kitchen windows.  I even remember it was a bay window, the kind where you can
  <span class="audiodef">
   roll the window open.
  </span>
  I
  <span class="audionotes">
   used to roll the window open
  </span>
  and just watch the airplanes
  <span class="audionotes">
   take off and land
  </span>
  all day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Another memory I have is the people, the couple that lived below us was an elderly couple and they acted pretty much like our grandparents.  I actually called them Grandma and Grandpa. Grandma Stevenson used to give me a bath in her kitchen sink because I was so small.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  That she would actually give me a bath in her kitchen sink and I remember that as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, those are good memories.
