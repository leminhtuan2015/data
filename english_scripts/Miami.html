   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, hello, Alexandra.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Hi, how are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m doing good. Now Alexandra, you&#39;re from Miami.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes, I am.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so why don&#39;t you tell us about Miami.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Born and
  <span class="audiodef">
   raised
  </span>
  in Miami, and it&#39;s very warm, very warm. Lots of different people. It seems to be the port of Central and South America, so there&#39;s several different people from different countries coming through, as well as from Europe and some parts of the North of the United States come down for a visit and it&#39;s a
  <span class="audiodef">
   tourist destination
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, were you born in Miami?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes, I was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you lived your whole life there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yep, yeah, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s cool, what&#39;s the best thing about Miami?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  The weather obviously, weather and the nearness to the ocean. Everything you can think of that can be done on the ocean, you can
  <span class="audiodef">
   find a way
  </span>
  to do it there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice, so what water sports do you play?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s water volleyball, and do some skiing, and diving, and also during season you can go and catch lobster down in the keys.
 </p>
 <p>
  Really
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes, so it can be fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s so cool. So you catch the lobster and eat it that night?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes. Yes. Absolutely. So you just go get the lobster out of the traps, take the upstairs to the boat, so to speak, and just throw them in a pot, and you&#39;re gonna have dinner in no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You don&#39;t eat them on the boat do you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  You can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really! People eat the lobsters on the boat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. Are they dangerous? I mean, cause they can
  <span class="audiodef">
   snip
  </span>
  your fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Well, you don&#39;t, you make sure you catch them in the right, hold them from the tail end and people usually put rubberbands around the claws, and you can just throw them into boiling water, get your butter out and you&#39;re
  <span class="audiodef">
   good to go
  </span>
