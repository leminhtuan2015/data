  One day last summer I had a very nice day with my girlfriend and my friends. We all decided one Saturday morning to go out to the beach. So we all organized it,
  <span class="audiodef">
   arranged
  </span>
  it, we all bought some food and some drinks, met out in Chiba and
  <span class="audiodef">
   took a taxi
  </span>
  out to the beach.

  </strong>
  It was very windy that day but it was still very nice. We all sat on the beach, talked, played
  <span class="audiodef">
   in the ocean
  </span>
  , ate and drank and then after that we got
  <span class="audiodef">
   sunburned
  </span>
  and went home. It was a really fun day and we all had a really
  <span class="audiodef">
   good time
  </span>
  .
