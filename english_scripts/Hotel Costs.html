  Todd:

 So, Mini, your country, Sri Lanka, is a very popular tourist destination. Can you talk a little about costs? Like how much does it cost to have a nice vacation in Sri Lanka?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a very cheap place to have a vacation, so for example if you have... your budget is around 50,000 yen
  <span class="audionotes">
   in terms of
  </span>
  rupees around 45,000 rupees, you can have a good vacation. You can have a good hotel. You can have good food. You can shop as well - by clothes and
  <span class="audionotes">
   all the stuff
  </span>
  and go around the country as well.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty cool. So, how much is a nice hotel, like a five-star hotel?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  For one day, it&#39;s around 10,000 yen. Around 9,500 rupees.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. So 10,000 yen. OK, so that&#39;s pretty cheap. That&#39;s about 100 dollars I think. Right? One hundred U.S. dollars? So, a five-star hotel, you&#39;re talking about beautiful room, nice swimming pool,
  <span class="audionotes">
   nice facilities
  </span>
  , everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Everything is there, and it&#39;s near the beach
  <span class="audionotes">
   as well
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, man, that&#39;s great. So, what if you want something cheaper. What if you just want a small room, very basic, just a bed, a bathroom, no swimming pool, nothing nice. How much would a hotel like that cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  OK, for that, you can pay around a thousand yen. Around nine hundred rupees.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A thousand yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  A thousand yen. A thousand, five hundred yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ten dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Mm-hm. That&#39;s cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  For one night?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Mm-hm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I wanna go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That is really, really cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s very cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what about things like internet access? So can you get high-speed internet access?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  If you want to stay in a hotel like that, no, you can&#39;t get internet access from those kind of hotels, but if you stay in four-star hotel, maybe three-star hotel you can get high-speed internet access.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  But you have like centers, internet media centers, kind of stuff. You can pay like fifty rupees and access to the internet. You can do it anytime.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. OK. And just lastly, what about meals? How much do meals cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  If you want to go for a nice
  <span class="audionotes">
   buffet
  </span>
  , maybe around two thousand yen, a thousand, five hundred rupees around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s actually kind of expensive, isn&#39;t it. Two thousand yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  But you have everything there. It&#39;s really nice. I love it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Well, it sounds like a great place to go. Thanks Mini.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
