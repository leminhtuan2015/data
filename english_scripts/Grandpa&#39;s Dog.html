  One of our dogs at home, he used to go walking with my granddad, and it was on these old country roads. So very quite really, not many cars would pass so the dog, Jonathan, used to run off in front of my granddad and my granddad&#39;s hearing wasn&#39;t too good at that time. He was already quite old, so he wouldn&#39;t always hear cars coming, so every time a car was coming, the dog would, Jonathan would come running back to my granddad so that, and he did this every time a car came so my granddad knew that if Jonathan came running back towards him, he knew that he had to stand in closer to the edge of the road so that, you know, he wouldn&#39;t be in danger of being knocked down by a car or anything because those old country roads, you know when I was younger, we used to walk in the middle of the road, or you know, not quite by the edge, cause there were so few cars, you didn&#39;t really need to keep by the edge and there were no foot paths along the side, so you were just walking along the edge of the road, so he was a really clever dog in he could alert my granddad, you know to whether a car was coming or not.

  I think most dogs are very intelligent. I&#39;ve met some people who say their dog is a bit stupid but I don&#39;t believe that really. I think most dogs are quite intelligent, even if they&#39;re not really good guard dogs, you know, some dogs aren&#39;t good guard dogs. They don&#39;t bark enough when strangers come or something like that, but I still think they&#39;re probably very intelligent, and even if they&#39;re not, they&#39;re probably very affectionate, which is a plus definitely. It&#39;s almost as good as having a really intelligent guard dog I think.
