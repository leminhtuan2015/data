   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   I&#39;ve noticed that you fall asleep everywhere.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, you&#39;ve noticed. Oh, no, it&#39;s actually a problem that I have.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Really?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah, I do get sleepy.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, it&#39;s just that whenever we come back from work, or we go to work, you always fall asleep on the bus.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   I do. I&#39;m so tired in the mornings.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So, you&#39;re tired in the mornings (Mm-hm) so don&#39;t you sleep at night?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   I do. I actually do go to bed quite early but I hate waking up really early
   <br>
   so I think it&#39;s the early mornings that really get to me.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So do you think lots of people in your family do this, because you know,
   <br>
   you really do seem to sleep far more than anybody I&#39;ve ever met.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Actually, yeah, my father does say that he falls asleep at work.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   No!
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah.And my mom falls asleep at work as well when there&#39;s not costumers.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, you&#39;re joking.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah. Yeah. So it runs in the family.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So have you ever done that? Have you ever fallen asleep at work?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Actually, well, I don&#39;t fall asleep when I&#39;m teaching, cause its such a busy job (Yeah) but when I was working in an office, when I was doing medical research, it was such a boring job that I did used to fall asleep in front of the computer sometimes. It&#39;s really embarrassing.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So have you ever had an embarrassing moment when you&#39;ve fallen asleep?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Actually, yes. One time we went to watch the symphony orchestra
   <br>
   and it was beautiful music and I was enjoying myself but I just fell asleep in between.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, no, Akane.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So how many hours sleep do you normally get Akane?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well, I try to get at least nine. Of course that&#39;s not always possible,
   <br>
   so I&#39;d say on average about eight and a half hours.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Eight and a half.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, I suppose if you add that to the five hours a day that you sleep that&#39;s quite a lot.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   If you put it that way.
