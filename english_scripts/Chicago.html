  It&#39;s very windy and flat, but there&#39;s a lot to do there. We have a lot of sports teams, things to do in the summer, lots of festivals, so...

  We have a taste of Chicago festival, every summer, every year, and it&#39;s down in Grant Park, and all the food vendors, all the major restaurants in Chicago set up a food booth and you can buy, taste all kinds of food around the world.

  <strong>
   Anna:
  </strong>
  You stuff it with cheese or they can put meat inside of it. It&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Can you make it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anna:

  No! I can not make it. I can make tacos, but that&#39;s about it.
