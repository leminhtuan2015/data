   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do you think about the zoo?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  I like to go to the zoo. I like to give all the animals names, like &#34;Bert the Giraffe&#34;, but I wish the animals didn&#39;t have to be in the zoo, but I think it is good when zoos
  <span class="audiodef">
   save
  </span>
  animals, and help to make their
  <span class="audiodef">
   populations
  </span>
  grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, they can do some good things,
  <span class="audiodef">
   definitely
  </span>
  . Ah, what is your favorite animal?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  My favorite animal, ooh, let me think. I love cats, just as a
  <span class="audiodef">
   pet
  </span>
  but, besides I&#39;d pick the coolest animal, I think I would pick probably a monkey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A monkey!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of monkeys in Japan. Have you ever seen a monkey
  <span class="audiodef">
   in the wild
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  No, but my brother is a wild monkey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, he&#39;s going to have to listen to this now.
