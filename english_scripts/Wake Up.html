   </strong>
   So, what did you do today?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, actually, I got up this morning quite early. I couldn&#39;t sleep so I was a little bit annoyed and then I went to church and I had some lunch and..

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, but, you said early, like how early?

    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, I think it was about 7 o&#39;clock.

   That&#39;s not early.

   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   That is early if you went to bed at 1.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s true. That&#39;s sleeping in for me.

   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s sleeping in. That&#39;s true. You&#39;re an early bird aren&#39;t you?

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Now, last night we went out and had the beers.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yeah!

    Todd:
   </strong>
   I was actually quite happy this morning. I had no hangover.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Did you not? (No) I felt a little bit queasy this morning, and I was a bit ashamed, and I didn&#39;t even drink very much. I wasn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t feel queasy. I think is was more that I hadn&#39;t had any sleep actually.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, did you feel guilty in church knowing that you still had the beer buzz?

 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   No. I didn&#39;t feel guilty about that.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, that would be tough one. No, I still got up this morning at 5:45.

   5:45!

   Yeah.

   You must be a lunatic.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Well, I mean when the light comes up and the light goes through your window, I don&#39;t know how people can still sleep. You know? You can sleep when the light, the sunrise still comes up?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Yeah, not for too, I mean I can&#39;t sleep forever, but like, 7 o&#39;clock, 8 o&#39;clock, then my body wakes up.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   The apartment I was at before, it was crazy because there was a rooster outside, and it didn&#39;t do what it was supposed to do, like normally when the sun comes up, the rooster is supposed to go, &#34;er-er-er-er&#34; or whatever,
   <br>
   but this thing did it at like 1 and 2 in the morning. It used to drive me nuts, so I used to always wake up at 2 because I&#39;d hear this rooster going &#34;er-er-er&#34; and I just wanted to kill that bird.

   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Did you go sleep, back to sleep after that?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, of course I went back to sleep, but the bird would wake me up regularly. Yeah. No roosters here.

    Ruth:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s not funny is it?

    Todd:

   Yeah.
