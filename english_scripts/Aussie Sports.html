   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Aaron can you talk a little about sports in Australia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aaron:
  </strong>
  No worries. In Australia, when I was a child, I used to play cricket and Australian football every weekend. In the winter, I played Australian football, and in the summer it was cricket. Now that I&#39;m older, I play golf. I play golf every weekend, and in summer sometimes during the week. In Australia it is really cheap to play golf. So, it&#39;s about ten Australian dollars, so it&#39;s very popular. A lot of people play golf, cricket and football. I used to play tennis, but I don&#39;t anymore. I once took tennis lessons, but as I said I don&#39;t play tennis anymore.
