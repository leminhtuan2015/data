  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I am a student.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, do you like to study? Do you like the student life?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Of course, you know. Actually, I, myself, I like studying although I&#39;m not that much of a
  <span class="audionotes">
   bookworm
  </span>
  , but, yes, I like studying. I like spending time with my friends, and I just like enjoying my student life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, soon, you are going to graduate, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes,, fortunately or unfortunately, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, why would you say fortunately?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Fortunately, in the sense that, you know, it&#39;s about time to get out to
  <span class="audionotes">
   the real world
  </span>
  and, you know, earn some money, and earn some experience but unfortunately in the sense that all of these precious memories, like you are putting them all behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, soon they are going to be over.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Right, right, and then you have more responsibility as soon as you step into the real world, you know. No more spring vacation. No more summer vacation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, that&#39;s why I&#39;m a teacher. People always ask me, why are you a teacher? And I say, because the time off. You get so much time off, and you don&#39;t have to work
  <span class="audionotes">
   a 9-5 schedule
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes, that is a very smart choice, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but you make no money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You think teachers make good money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, not actually, but you know you can be fresher and then forever young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t know about forever young but it does... you do feel invigorated when you&#39;re teacher. I do agree. Well, you know, if you don&#39;t want to give up the student life, you can just become a teacher. Would you like to become a teacher?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, I have given it a couple of thoughts but right now,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m really into the banking industry
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Banking?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the financing industry, and then so probably I might like
  <span class="audionotes">
   give it a go
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s going to be very stressful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  It is, but you know, I pretty much like the fast-paced lifestyle, and I&#39;m interested in the content of the work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, good-luck with banking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Thank you. It&#39;s going to be really harsh, I know.
