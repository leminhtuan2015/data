   Todd
  </b>
  : Okay. So Sarah, I see you eat soup every day at work. Why are you eating soup every day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : That’s because I love to cook soup.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : So you make the soup?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yes, it’s very easy to make.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : So you cook it and then you just bring it to work everyday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. I just make a lot on Monday and then I bring it to work everyday of the week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Oh nice. So how do you make the soup? What’s your secret?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Well, I like to cook very easy. So I buy meat that’s already cut up, usually, chicken and then some rice, usually brown rice and then I buy some vegetables. So after I bought the ingredients, I chop them up and I put them all together in water until boils and add some
  <span class="audionotes">
   seasoning
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Okay. So you say the water boils, so as soon as the water boils that’s when you put in all the ingredients?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yes, that’s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : So you don’t put in the
  <span class="audionotes">
   ingredients
  </span>
  before the water boils.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : No. I guess, it’s just easier for the water to be hot because then the vegetables and the meat cook a little faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : So how do you give the soup flavoring?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : I usually add salt and pepper, maybe some garlic. And depending on the type of soup, either maybe some soy sauce or lemon juice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Okay. Do you put in the flavoring after you put in the ingredients or before you put in the ingredients?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Maybe after but usually, right about all at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : So I just put everything in at one time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : And then after you cook the soup, do you put the soup in the refrigerator? Do you let it sit outside?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : I usually eat some right then, and I also put it in
  <span class="audionotes">
   containers
  </span>
  for the week. But I
  <span class="audionotes">
   let it sit
  </span>
  in the containers out on the counter for a while for it to cool before I put in the refrigerator.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : All right. And so, you don’t put it in the refrigerator until it is cool?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Until it’s about room temperature.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Okay, nice. And then how do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   heat it up
  </span>
  ? Do you heat it up in a pot or do you heat it up in the microwave?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : In the microwave. It’s the easiest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. Nice. So you make enough for five meals?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Maybe, sometimes. If I think I will
  <span class="audionotes">
   get tired of
  </span>
  eating it during the week then maybe I’ll just make enough for three or four meals. But if it’s some kind that I think is really delicious and I know I want to eat it everyday, then I’ll make a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Well, if that happens, when you make the soup, you can make it for six or seven and give me a bowl.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Okay. I’ll do that next time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Oh great. Thanks.
