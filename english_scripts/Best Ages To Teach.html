  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : So your favorite age group is the junior high school age.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Do you have much experience teaching younger children?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Younger children like toddler age?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Well, how about elementary school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, elementary school. I&#39;ve been teaching for about five years, five or six years. They&#39;re fine. You just have to be a bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   silly
  </span>
  with those kids.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Have a good time. Can&#39;t really be too serious when you&#39;re teaching young kids because they&#39;re still kids.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true. So how about younger than that? How about the kindergarten age? How are they for you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : They&#39;re probably my
  <span class="audionotes">
   achilles heel
  </span>
  . I&#39;m not great with kindergarten students or younger than that because they don&#39;t respond to reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So they – I mean, yeah. They&#39;re difficult for me to teach. I prefer teaching older students.
 </p>
 <p>
  How about you? What kind of age range do you like teaching?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I think I appreciate all parts of all age groups. Every group has its
  <span class="audionotes">
   pros and cons
  </span>
  . Recently, I&#39;ve been teaching university students, and I think I&#39;m remembering how much I enjoy it because, you know, they are adults and you can teach them like adults. And you can still have a bit of silly, fun with them, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : So these days, I think I prefer teaching the older students, university age students. You can, you know, you can really go into topics quite deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : And you can get some interesting answers from some students. Other students, of course, you can&#39;t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Everyone is different, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yes. You just have to find a way of teasing, teasing their potential, of all of them, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Is there a group that you don&#39;t like teaching?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m not used to junior high school children, junior high school students. I don&#39;t have any experience with them. So that would make me nervous, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : How do you think they would be different to university students?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I think, from what I mentioned before, the teenagers, the
  <span class="audionotes">
   hormones
  </span>
  . I think that would be different. There&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   bubbling inside
  </span>
  them, all of these changes of feelings and emotions. And they have so many things to deal with; pressure of growing up. And I think that can be more challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I think it&#39;s important as a teacher to try to remember what it was like when you were that age.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I think that&#39;s the biggest thing that will help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Absolutely. So what do you think about teaching younger children like babies? How are you with that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : I do really enjoy that. Babies are awesome. They have their own set of needs. But usually, the very young classes come with, you know, the parents are there, too. So it&#39;s kind of a group-led situation, teacher-led group. And yeah, it&#39;s good fun for me. They&#39;re very cute and squishy. And very – not uncontrollable – what&#39;s the word?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Unpredictable?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s it. Completely unpredictable. You know, one day they can be in the best mood ever, and then the next day, they&#39;re just
  <span class="audionotes">
   a nightmare
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : I think that&#39;s why I&#39;m terrified of them, because they&#39;re so unpredictable. I don&#39;t like it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah. That&#39;s true. And the bodily functions too, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, no thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : There&#39;s all of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I&#39;m not prepared to deal with that. No, thank you. No, thank you. No bodily functions.
