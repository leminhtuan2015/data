   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Jeff, you have your own
  <span class="audionotes">
   website
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Yes, I do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Very nice site!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, can you just talk about your website?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Yes. The address, I&#39;ll give you my address first to the website.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So, you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   have a look
  </span>
  at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  www.eagarbros.com. E-A-G-A-R-B-R-O-S dot C-O-M and it&#39;s eagerbros.com because my
  <span class="audionotes">
   last name
  </span>
  is Eagar, Jeff Eagar. And &#34;Bros&#34; is short for brothers and I have three brothers but I have two brothers that I travel with
  <span class="audionotes">
   around the world
  </span>
  , different countries with and so it&#39;s sort of like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   video diary
  </span>
  of some of the things we&#39;ve seen and done on our travels with people and places. Yeah, it&#39;s interesting. It&#39;s got video, stories and audio. It&#39;s all about people and poverty and wealth and their serenity..of the world. It&#39;s pretty good. It&#39;s pretty interesting I think.
 </p>

   Todd:
  </strong>
