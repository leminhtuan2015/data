  Anita:
 </strong>
 Well, Todd, since you&#39;ve asked me about San Francisco, tell me, have you ever been to Prague?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I have been to Prague. Actually, I lived in Prague for about a week, or two weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A long time ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Right out of
  </span>
  college.

  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Really. And how did you like it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, it was great. It was one of the first European cities I went to, and it was so different from America, and I thought the architecture downtown was really beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  So what was your
  <span class="audionotes">
   first impression
  </span>
  when you got there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, when I first got there, I had no place to stay, and this young kid
  <span class="audionotes">
   came up to
  </span>
  me and convinced me to live in his house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So they... his mother was renting rooms to foreigners, so I lived with a Czech family for about ten days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Really, so did you eat Czech food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I did, but you know I don&#39;t remember anything about it. It was so long ago. It seemed really good though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I guess. I like it. So what did you do in Prague? What did you see there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, of course I went to the downtown area which had the castle and the bridge and lots of the old buildings, and I just took
  <span class="audionotes">
   local transportation
  </span>
  . I took the... I guess it&#39;s not a subway or...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  It is. You can call it a subway. We call it the Metro.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I took the Metro to different places and I took buses and just walked around the city and I had a good time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Did you find it cheap or expensive compared to the States?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, it was really cheap, but at that time I was working in Europe and I had no money, so I still was very poor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Hmm, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so now... I was in Prague, you know, 12 years ago. Do you think the city changed a lot since I was there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s changed very much. I guess since the fall of Communism in 1989, the city started changing at that time and it&#39;s still changing. It&#39;s become very modern. Of course the historical parts are still preserved. You&#39;re not allowed to build skyscrapers or very tall buildings. It&#39;s good because after the fall of Communism a lot of the buildings were renovated, so the whole city looks like it&#39;s new. It&#39;s old new.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s very colorful. It&#39;s just beautiful. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I remember, the city almost looked like a museum because the buildings were just so
  <span class="audionotes">
   pristine and perfect
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yeah. It&#39;s... I personally just love walking through the streets. You can never get tired of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, hopefully I can go back again someday.
