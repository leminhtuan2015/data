  Todd:
 </strong>
 Hey, Melissa, we&#39;re talking about big events this week and what are some big events that you really enjoy?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  I like doing community events. I&#39;m trying to get more involved in community events. There&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a flea market
  </span>
  this weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A flea market?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  At the beachside, and there&#39;s going to be lots of different
  <span class="audionotes">
   eco-friendly stuff
  </span>
  going on there, so it&#39;s kind of a mix of a reuse, resell your old stuff. Get new stuff for cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so for people who might not be familiar with the term flea market, can you explain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  A flea market is basically a place where people can take old clothes, old
  <span class="audionotes">
   utensils
  </span>
  , forks, spoons, knives, things like that from the kitchen, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   other housewares
  </span>
  either sell them or give them away at a cheap price, and it&#39;s fun because the customers ... a lot of them like to come and look at all the different stuff and even maybe haggle some prices, so try to get you to give a lower price, or if you&#39;re trying to get rid of a lot of stuff you might try to get the customer to take
  <span class="audionotes">
   two things for the price of one
  </span>
  . Things like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, right. Like when I was a kid I used to always go to flea marts, or flea markets with my grandparents, and what I thought was great is that you can haggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right? Cause in the U.S. you can&#39;t haggle at a store.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Yeah, exactly
  </span>
  . And I like doing that when I&#39;m travelling ... haggling. Trying to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get a good deal
  </span>
  , so it&#39;s fun to do it at a flea market when you&#39;re selling your own stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, this weekend, are you selling or buying?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Well, I actually don&#39;t have that much stuff to sell cause I&#39;ve recently moved so I&#39;ve gotten rid of a lot of stuff I don&#39;t need, but I do plan bring some old pieces of clothing and things like that that I want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get rid of
  </span>
  , and yeah, I&#39;m really into flea markets and
  <span class="audionotes">
   old thrift stores
  </span>
  and stuff like that, so I just like to see what people have. If there&#39;s something cool, I might buy it.
