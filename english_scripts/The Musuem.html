   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Shona, you&#39;re an artist and you like art so you must have a special routine when you go to a gallery or  a museum. Do you have any recommendations  how to appreciate art when you go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sure. I think people tend to follow
  <span class="audionotes">
   a specific ritual
  </span>
  when they go into an art gallery, which I think is a bit odd in my opinion. I don&#39;t know, like, they might kind of, they&#39;ll be talking to their friends outside the gallery or museum but as soon as they go in they start speaking really quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  And like
  <span class="audionotes">
   hushed tones
  </span>
  as if it&#39;s like, you know, what you do when you go into church or chapel or temple or whatever. You kind of speak a bit more quietly because you are in a sacred place. People treat the art gallery and the museum as a sacred place, so their voice will go down. They might start to kind of be a bit unsure of where they are standing, like, &#34;Oh, am I in someone&#39;s way?&#34;  or I think in an art gallery or museum, to fully appreciate what you are like looking at, you&#39;ve got to be  a tiny bit selfish. You shouldn&#39;t worry to much about people around you, you know, because if you&#39;re a bit self-conscious or whatever, you&#39;re not going to be really appreciating what&#39;s around you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, you know, that&#39;s really interesting but I thought you were supposed to be quiet. Like, I thought if you talk, then they&#39;ll ask you to leave, or you&#39;ll be breaking the rules.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  No, not at all. Not at all. Maybe like in a library or something, like at university where people are studying and you&#39;re not allowed to speak but in an art gallery or museum it supposed to be quiet interactive. It doesn&#39;t matter which one you are in. You know, it doesn&#39;t matter how
  <span class="audionotes">
   grumpy looking
  </span>
  the attendants are, who are like there, or you know, what the clientele is. You should be able to openly speak about what you are seeing around you, and like, honestly, I feel so passionately about it. Like I think you should be able to talk, and it&#39;s not a rule. It&#39;s not a rule. Like, have you ever like saw someone talking loudly and they&#39;ve been
  <span class="audionotes">
   chucked out
  </span>
  of an art gallery or museum for doing so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know what, I can&#39;t remember, but I can&#39;t even remember anybody talking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Exactly. Well the next time you&#39;re in an art gallery or museum you should talk and be lively and see what happens.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, but if I get
  <span class="audionotes">
   thrown out
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s my fault.
