   Matt:
  </strong>
  If I were traveling to Scotland would it be very expensive for me to spend time in Glasgow?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;d say there some of the hotels that are
  <span class="audionotes">
   quite expensive
  </span>
  , but you can usually find a nice
  <span class="audionotes">
   bed-and-breakfast
  </span>
  which
  <span class="audionotes">
   would cost you
  </span>
  maybe thirty pounds, English pounds. Scottish pounds even.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Right, right, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  A night, and that would have breakfast included.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that sounds good. And what about like transportation?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Glasgow&#39;s one of the few cities out of London that has an underground and it only has one line, so it&#39;s called the clockwork orange cause it just goes around in a big circle. But it&#39;s quite cheap to use. And the good think about Glasgow actually is it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   walkable
  </span>
  . You can walk around the city quite easily without having to take transportation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s good. And is that named after the movie?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  OK, alright.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  I think that was a sort of reference to it. Yeah. And it is orange. The line, the picture of the line is orange, so. And the buses in Glasgow are orange.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Okay, it&#39;s a theme.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yes. I don&#39;t know why. Different cities in Britain have different colored buses, like Edinburgh&#39;s buses are maroon and London&#39;s buses are red.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Yeah, everyone chooses a color.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Does it match the flag or the region or local area?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know why Glasgow&#39;s orange and Edinburgh&#39;s maroon but that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   the way it is
  </span>
  .
