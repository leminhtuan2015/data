President Donald Trump has sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Thursday, saying that a proposed trip to visit troops in Afghanistan and allies in Europe is canalled.
<br><br>
AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports.
<br><br>
Pelosi yesterday moved to delay the president's state of the union address.  "... and we haven't heard, very silent, more than 24 hours."
<br><br>
In remarks at the Pentagon, the president did not address the request but re-upped his demand for border wall money.
<br><br>
"We need strong barriers and walls."
<br><br>
And hours later, he did flex his executive power, denying Pelosi the use of a government aircraft for a planned trip to Egypt, Brussels and Afghanistan.
<br><br>
In a letter to her, he called it a public relations event that should be postponed due to the shutdown.
<br><br>
Pelosi and other lawmakers were due to leave today.  The president says she's free to go if she wants to fly commercial.

President Trump unveiled the nation's long-delayed Missile Defense Review, the first overhaul of U.S. missile defense policy since 2010.
<br><br>
Speaking at the Pentagon Thursday, Trump said the aim is to counter missile developments by U.S. adversaries.
<br><br>
"They're increasing their lethal strike capabilities and they're focused on developing long-range missiles that could reach targets within the United States."
<br><br>
Officials say the doctrine, initially expected in 2017, has been frequently rewritten to keep up with changing missile threats posed by North Korea, China, Russia and Iran.
<br><br>
Recognizing the potential concerns surrounding any perceived weaponization of space, the strategy pushes for studies only.  No testing is mandated and no final decisions have been made.

President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen says he paid to rig polling data in the president's favor before the 2016 election.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Warren Levinson has details.
<br><br>
The president's former fixer Michael Cohen was responding to a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> story that said he short-changed a technology company for its work manipulating polling data in 2014 and 2015.
<br><br>
The journal reported Cohen promised the company $50,000 but delivered only 12 to 13,000 in cash.  Cohen acknowledged he paid to skew poll results in Trump's favor, in his words, "at the direction of and for the sole benefit of Trump."
<br><br>
Cohen, who started a three-year prison sentence in March, says he regrets his blind loyalty.
<br><br>
Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani told the journal Cohen is not reliable.

The U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, is calling on Sudanese authorities to stop using excessive force to repress peaceful anti-government demonstrations.
<br><br>
Lisa Schlein reports from Geneva.
<br><br>
Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, tells VOA the government's response has only made things worse.
<br><br>
"So, we are calling on the government to ensure that any report of excessive use of force, including live ammunition by the security forces, are investigated and that they engage in a dialogue with the protesters instead of seeking to repress them."
<br><br>
The government confirms 24 people have died in the course of the protests.  The U.N. says it has credible reports indicating the death toll may be twice as high.
<br><br>
Sudanese authorities also confirm that up to January 6, at least 816 protesters have been arrested.  They reportedly include journalists, opposition leaders and members of civil society.

Burkina Faso's security ministry said Thursday a Canadian geologist kidnapped earlier this week has been found dead.
<br><br>
Kirk Woodman was abducted by gunmen late Tuesday from a remote gold mine in the country's northeast region.
<br><br>
Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland confirmed Woodman's death.  "His family has the sympathy of our whole country and our government is working with, will continue to work on the ground in Burkina Faso and with the authorities in Burkina Faso, to be sure that the people responsible for this terrible killing face justice."
<br><br>
Woodman's death raises concerns about Islamist factions making forays into the country that so far has been spared the violence that has plagued its neighbors.
<br><br>
<br><br>
A suicide truck bombing at a police academy Thursday in Colombia killed at least 10 and wounded 54 others.
<br><br>
The pickup truck packed with explosives crashed through the gate of the officers' school south of Bogota.
<br><br>
Colombian prosecutors have identified the driver, but no group has claimed responsibility.
