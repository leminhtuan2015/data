  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Anita, I thought we would talk about money and investments.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you&#39;re pretty young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And how old are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I am 23.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  23, so that&#39;s very young. So as a young person, do you think about your future and saving and  retirement?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I think about my
  <span class="audionotes">
   immediate future
  </span>
  . I&#39;m not too worried about my retirement
  <span class="audionotes">
   just yet
  </span>
  , simply because I think you never know : will you retire? will you not retire? I mean, sometimes people
  <span class="audionotes">
   get so caught up
  </span>
  planning for retirement and saving money for retirement and they don&#39;t get to enjoy their life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. But I think, like, I&#39;m getting older. I&#39;m 37 right, so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s still young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s still fairly young, but I think everybody that&#39;s my age wishes we had started saving when we were your age.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I agree. I agree. I&#39;m not thinking about retirement but I&#39;m definitely thinking about my immediate future. What will I do after university? Because right now, I&#39;m a  graduate student. When I was an undergraduate, I never thought about saving.  I just was worried about paying monthly bills, paying my rent, things like that, so I was worried about having enough money to pay the
  <span class="audionotes">
   current expenses
  </span>
  . I wasn&#39;t worried about savings, but now that I&#39;m  a graduate student and I&#39;m about to finish my education, I have to think about what will I do after university. Where will I go? If I look for  a job, maybe I will have to travel somewhere. Maybe there will be a period of time when I will not have a job, so that, yes, I am worried about, so right now I&#39;m thinking about savings for that part of my life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Anita, you&#39;re married, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So is finances something that you normally talk with your husband or is it something that you still are used to doing separately and independently?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  No, no, no. We have
  <span class="audionotes">
   joint accounts
  </span>
  . Any financial things we discuss.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, yeah, cause I think especially with marriage, that&#39;s probably always one of the main things is money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  You see, for me personally, I don&#39;t think how I could... I cannot imagine that I would be married to somebody and have two separate bank accounts: one for him and one for me. I don&#39;t think that would work for me personally.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it does actually sound strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Because then, think about it, if you go for dinner with your husband, who pays?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  And if it&#39;s him paying all the time, well that&#39;s not fair towards him, so I think once you&#39;re in the marriage together, once you&#39;re doing everything together, you might as well be saving and spending together as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re right. That makes perfect sense, but I think in the U.S. nowadays it&#39;s common now for couples to have separate checking accounts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  It is and, even my parents had that for awhile. I personally don&#39;t like it because to me it seems like a back door. If somebody had two accounts and their married to me it&#39;s a way of saying, &#34;I love you and I&#39;m married to you, but just in case something happens to us, I&#39;ve got my own account to depend on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Great point.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  And to me, personally, I will do my upmost best for my relationship not to get to that point, so because I am not even taking that into consideration, I&#39;m not acting that way right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well said.
 </p>
