  Mari:
 </strong>
 This week&#39;s theme is comparing cities. Mike, you&#39;ve lived in both Florida and Hawaii, and both of these places, people go there on vacation, so can you compare the weather?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, actually both places are warm most of the year. Well, actually Hawaii is warm all year. But I would say that Hawaii&#39;s weather is probably better than Florida because the weather in Hawaii is
  <span class="audionotes">
   not as extreme
  </span>
  as it is in Florida and... so where as the temperatures in Florida would
  <span class="audionotes">
   range from
  </span>
  fifty degree to ninety degrees, in Hawaii it would stay between seventy-five and eighty-five degrees most of the year.

   Mari:
  </strong>
  Wow. That&#39;s really nice weather. How about the food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well the food, in both places are really good but it&#39;s quite different. Both places of course you can get good American food, like burgers and
  <span class="audionotes">
   that type of thing
  </span>
  , but in Florida you get a lot of foods such as Cuban food or Jamaican food which is really good that you can&#39;t get in Hawaii, but in Hawaii there&#39;s a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   Asian influence
  </span>
  so you can get really good Japanese food or Thai food, but also traditional Polynesian food as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Wow.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Sounds yummy
  </span>
  . How about the shopping?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, the shopping varies between both places. Florida is a lot cheaper than Hawaii. Food shopping as well as clothing and that sort of thing. I guess in Hawaii everything has to be shipped over so it&#39;s a little bit more expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I didn&#39;t know that. How about the night life?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  The night life in both places are really good. Hawaii has a lot of clubs if you like that type of thing and Florida of course has a lot of clubs if you like that type of thing, but there&#39;s also good bars or just movies and shows in both places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  If you could live in one place, where would you live?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  I would choose to live in Hawaii. Well, I&#39;m from Hawaii so I have a bias towards it, but I think Hawaii would be better between the two places for me.
