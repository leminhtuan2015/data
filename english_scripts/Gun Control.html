  : So Adria I hear you&#39;re a Democrat, is that right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adria
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;m a registered Democrat, what about yourself?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shiloh
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m actually a registered Republican, so we&#39;re opposites like that. I&#39;ve got a question for you. I&#39;m from New Mexico which is a very conservative state like a lot of the western US and I grew up around
  <span class="audionotes">
   firearms
  </span>
  and guns, what do you think about that? What do other Democrats think about gun control laws?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adria
  </strong>
  : Well, I&#39;m from Kentucky and we tend to be something called Blue Dog Democrats where you support some conservative
  <span class="audionotes">
   ideology
  </span>
  such as gun control and being very pro-gun but personally I don&#39;t like handguns and many other types of guns also and I have
  <span class="audionotes">
   strong convictions
  </span>
  about keeping guns under control personally.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shiloh
  </strong>
  : But most Democrats, I think, want to have really strong gun control laws to make it illegal to own a handgun, do you think this is right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adria
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s difficult. I don&#39;t like handguns and yes I think that there should be really strict gun control laws to make it so you cannot have handguns. I don&#39;t mind rifles and shotguns as much for hunting purposes or recreational purposes, but handguns tend to be used too much in organised crime, so yeah I would agree with that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shiloh
  </strong>
  : OK. I actually see that because I agree with you that
  <span class="audionotes">
   pistols
  </span>
  are the ones that are the big problem because they&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   concealable
  </span>
  . People can go buy them and put them in your jacket and you don&#39;t know that they have it. I think definitely you need to have better rules and educational levels that are necessary before you can buy a handgun. Right now, if you&#39;re twenty one in the United States and you&#39;re a citizen of that state you can just go buy a pistol and I think that maybe things need to be updated so that you actually have to go take classes and so that everybody knows that if you&#39;re going to own a pistol you need to know how to use it, we need to make sure that you&#39;re not a crazy person, you&#39;re not going to use it badly.
