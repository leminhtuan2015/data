   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So how do you eat the sushi? What&#39;s the best way to eat it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  I usually use chopsticks but some people, they definitely prefer just using hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  You can eat with your hands at the restaurant?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  The restaurant if it&#39;s more an
  <span class="audionotes">
   upscale
  </span>
  restaurant, that it has a little art deco that you feel that it is not like old school, but really upscale restaurant. I would recommend to use chopsticks but if it&#39;s an old school sushi restaurant and in downtown area, yeah, it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   totally acceptable
  </span>
  to use your hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Interesting. OK, so I am eating maybe with chopsticks or with my hands. Is there anything I need to put on the sushi or eat with the sushi or do I just eat is straight?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  OK, I think the big question&#39;s always, how much wasabi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Wasabi? What&#39;s wasabi?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  Wasabi is a
  <span class="audionotes">
   horseradish
  </span>
  . It&#39;s really hot. The green one you might have seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, it looks like putty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  Correct. And the real sushi restaurant, they actually either ask you or you basically let the sushi chef decide how much they are gonna put on the sushi, and you basically, you just use soy sauce as a dip and eat it, so if you really don&#39;t like to have anything spicy you might want to tell the chef that I don&#39;t need wasabi in my sushi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  OK, I saw someone once at a sushi restaurant put wasabi in the soy sauce. Is that acceptable?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s acceptable but it depends on the restaurant. Some restaurants actually give you wasabi along with your sushi dish and you add the wasabi onto the soy sauce trey.
  <span class="audionotes">
   That&#39;s totally fine
  </span>
  . You can control the hotness, the spiciness. Yeah, that&#39;s fine and also you can just
  <span class="audionotes">
   go without
  </span>
  wasabi and just enjoy the natural flavor of fish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  What happens if you eat too much wasabi?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  Basically, tears comes out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  You burn your brain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi
  </strong>
  : You burn your brain. Yeah.
