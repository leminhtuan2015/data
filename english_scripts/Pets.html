  Yeah, so I think from growing up with dogs, like we always had dogs at home or my granddads house, so we were always playing with dogs, so I&#39;ve never really had a fear of dogs like some people have, and I always considered myself a dog person, you know the way some, well most people consider themselves either a cat person or a dog person so that they either prefer cats or dogs, so I always thought of myself as a dog person, although recently in the last year or two, I&#39;m kind of wondering about that because I&#39;ve met some really nice cats,
 </p>
 <p>
  though before I always thought of cats as being too, too independent really and almost haughty or snobby towards people cause they didn&#39;t really, they don&#39;t really seem to need people or need affection as much as dogs do and that&#39;s a really nice part about dogs I think is that you really feel an attachment to them and they&#39;re so happy when they see you and you can really tell as long as you treat them well obviously that they really love you and they&#39;ll look after you.
