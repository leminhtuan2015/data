   Todd
  </strong>
  : Hey Katie. I&#39;m having a party, Super Bowl party at my house on Sunday in a couple of weeks. Would you like to come over?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Okay. But I have absolutely no idea what a Super Bowl is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, you know, the Super Bowl is a big sporting event and we have it once a year. But it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t know anything about American football because actually, the Super Bowl is kind of like our unofficial holiday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So what happens is, is everybody comes over to somebody&#39;s house, and you have a big party and you watch the game but nobody really watches the game. There&#39;s lots of other stuff going on so it&#39;s should be good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Do you have like Super Bowl food that you eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Exactly. Exactly. So it&#39;s kind of like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a big feast
  </span>
  . So we&#39;ll have, you know, like hamburgers and stuff we&#39;ll barbecue. And we&#39;ll have lots of like chips and dip and stuff like that. So you don&#39;t have to bring any food but it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   potluck
  </span>
  . So if you do want to bring something, yeah, I would recommend it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Do you have to be like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a supporter
  </span>
  of one of the teams in the final?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No. And actually, the game is not for a couple of weeks so we don&#39;t know who the two final teams are going to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : All right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : They still have to decide, but actually, there&#39;s a bunch of things that have nothing to do with football on the Super Bowl that you&#39;ll probably like. The first is, they have the halftime show. You may have heard about the Super Bowl halftime show.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You like music, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : I love music.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. So they always have a really big musical act. And actually this year, I don&#39;t remember who it is. I&#39;ll have to check but it&#39;s usually somebody like Bruno Mars or U2 or somebody like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : I think last year, it was Katie Perry, was it not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It might have been. Yeah. But it&#39;s always a really, really big person. Another thing that&#39;s really cool about the Super Bowl is the
  <span class="audionotes">
   commercials
  </span>
  . So the commercials, you know, the companies spend a lot of money on the commercials, and they&#39;re usually really good. So the commercials—the people are often more into the commercials than the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Especially if one team is kind of – if it&#39;s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   lopsided
  </span>
  win. So yeah, so the commercials are fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : What kind of commercials do they have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You know, like companies like Pepsi or Coke or like really big name companies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : So the really big ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. They&#39;ll spend like millions and millions of dollars. These are usually the most expensive commercials because it&#39;s one local game and one local audience. Like the World Cup is a more watched event but the commercials are regional for all the different countries, whereas the Super Bowl, the commercials are just for Americans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So yeah, these are usually the most expensive commercials like around the world. So they&#39;re usually really well done.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Is it just American teams in the Super Bowl?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yes, it&#39;s very, you know, Americanized name, I&#39;d say. But, you know, like I said, the game is really not that important. But there is one way that you can make money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Okay. I&#39;m interested.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So what happens is, we have like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a poo
  </span>
  l and you can draw numbers. And like you don&#39;t have to know anything about football but you can have like, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   draw numbers
  </span>
  for the first person to score a touchdown, or the first player to get a penalty or things like that. And you just fill out the chart and then if your player gets that, then you can get money.
 </p>
 <p>
  So you have to contribute. You have to pay like 10 bucks to play. But then it&#39;s in the pool and then you could win money at different points during the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Have you ever won at the Super Bowl before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s kind of like how it works out where everybody wins a little money and everybody loses a little money. So, you know, gambling technically is illegal but…
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. But it&#39;s like just one of those things that everybody does.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s not for big money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Just a little bit of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Just a little bit of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : So it&#39;s okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Just to have fun. Yeah. So, and then, once I find out what teams are in the finals then I&#39;ll tell you about the colors. And it&#39;s usually best that you choose one team that you&#39;re going to support.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So I&#39;ll fill you in about who the teams are later and all that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So are you willing to come?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Sounds like fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay, cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m in.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right. So it&#39;s going to be at my house at 3:00. So if you can show up around 2:00-ish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Should I bring some food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You can. Like you can bring some type of maybe salad or like a bean dish or something like that if you like. But we&#39;ll – like the main food, we&#39;ll provide. We&#39;ll have pizza. We&#39;ll have burgers. Oh, and it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   BYOB
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So if you want to drink, you have to bring your own alcohol.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : All right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : But we will have some beers and stuff. Do you drink?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Like tenths of the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right. So see you there. Glad you can come.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : No worries.
