   Alex:
  </strong>
  So Maria, I thought we&#39;d just talk about things like what would you like to change about yourself? What would you like to change about your appearance?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Well, I don&#39;t like to think about changing myself. I like how people look from the birth, if you can say that, but if I should choose I would like to change my height because I&#39;m very tall and it does
  <span class="audionotes">
   cause a problem
  </span>
  when I&#39;m looking for a guy especially since in the past I happen
  <span class="audionotes">
   to fall for
  </span>
  shorter guys and I got issues because they were always being
  <span class="audionotes">
   intimidated
  </span>
  by my height especially when I wore heels so I would like to be, like have my body because I do like my long legs but just be shorter and not be taller than everybody as I am at the moment, all of my friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  I guess that would also
  <span class="audionotes">
   lead to
  </span>
  you having problems finding shoes and clothes and stuff like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria:
  </strong>
  Indeed, yes. I have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   watch out
  </span>
  . Well in my country it&#39;s not a problem to find shoe sizes because we are a very tall people normally so shoes are big and clothes are big but when I travel, I went to China to visit a friend and I wanted to go shopping and it&#39;s impossible to find shoes and long pants and fitting bras too, if you can imagine. So I would like to change my height but otherwise I might change like my weight for example or I have changed my hair color several times. I went from black to blonde to black to red to blonde so otherwise I think I&#39;m fine with me.
