   Todd:
  </strong>
  Alexandra, you worked at an airport before. You said you worked in Aviation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes, my previous job was write contracts for an aviation company and we bought and sold airplanes and aircraft engines, so we did a lot of
  <span class="audiodef">
   marketing
  </span>
  and leasing and speaking to people from different countries, and airlines wanting to buy
  <br>
  equipment, so a lot of negotiations.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Can you explain what leasing is?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Leasing is when our company owns a piece of equipment, either an airplane or an engine and a customer has a need, for example, if their airplane has to do some maintenance, and they need a replacement, then we will let them use our airplane for a certain amount of months, like you rent a car, same thing, same idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. And you lease not only the plane but engines as well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Sometimes you have an airplane that&#39;s delayed at the airport because of some reason and they need to
  <span class="audiodef">
   swap an engine out
  </span>
  , or whatever.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right before the plane takes off, they sometimes
  <span class="audiodef">
   switch
  </span>
  engines?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  They&#39;ll
  <span class="audiodef">
   take the passengers off
  </span>
  and put them on another plane cause it takes a lot longer than the 10 or 15 minute
  <span class="audiodef">
   turnaround
  </span>
  , but, you will have, it&#39;s more an emergency type of situation, so they&#39;ll take the engine off, and it might be and overnight deal so we go ahead and furnish a replacement engine until they can move that plane back to where it belongs or have the engine repaired.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So can you lease a pilot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You can, yes, you can lease a crew. Yes! It&#39;s called a wet lease, and we used to do dry leases meaning we only provided the equipment but a wet lease includes a full crew that will fly the airplane, flight attendants, etc.
