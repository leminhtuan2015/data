   So if I was going to take a trip to Hawaii, what do you recommend? Which I island should I go to? What should I see?

   First you have to

    have a goal in mind

   I would have to say, first if you want to go, go to Ohau because it&#39;s the most populated and has the most things to do (OK) like for a two-week vacation I would say, first you go to Waikiki, the town side
   <span class="audionotes">
    where the most action is
   </span>
   , and it&#39;s the most expensive, it&#39;s where all the hotels are, but stay there for a couple of days, and get out. Go to a more natural areas where the beaches are nicer, you know, more of the local culture, you see what real life is about.

   It&#39;s not so much about tourism, but the real hawaiian life.

 <p>

   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Yeah, the real Hawaiian life.

   Isn&#39;t Waikiki where many Japanese...
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Waikiki is where all the Japanese go. And it&#39;s a nice place because it real
   <span class="audionotes">
    built up nice
   </span>
   <strong>
    .
   </strong>
   There&#39;s a lot of things to do, clubs, bars, you know, hotels, restaurants, but there&#39;s also nice beaches. Right in Waikiki is called Daimond Head, where it&#39;s the most, it used to be a volcano, but now it&#39;s
   <span class="audionotes">
    inactive
   </span>
   , and you can do a nice hike up Diamond Head and see the island from the top.

   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   There&#39;s actually active volcanoes in Hawaii, aren&#39;t there?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Yeah, it called Kilauea
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Kilauea, oh, there&#39;s only one?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Two, two volcanoes but Kilauea is the most active volcanoe in the world. It&#39;s always flowing, for example you get within
   <span class="audionotes">
    fifty yards
   </span>
   of lava flowing right in front of your eyes.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   And can you feel the heat?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Oh, definitely. That&#39;s why they give, they say you can only go so close to the lava because it&#39;s really hot.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   So it would be actually dangerous?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Yeah, and they say the gas emmisions from the volcano is also dangerous.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   And I&#39;m curious. Since Hawaii is such a tourist destination, what is the attitude of the local people towards tourists. Do you welcome them or sometimes, oh, I wish these people would get out of our country, you know, get off our island. Leave us alone.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   Yeah, I think some of the local people do feel that way towards foreigners. They feel like they&#39;re taking over the island, for example, you know, or like for example, the white people are taking over our island they say, you know. There is that stereotype, but without tourism right now, Hawaii would not survive, cause it&#39;s our bread and butter money-maker you know.

   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   I see.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mitchell:
   </strong>
   But at the same time, culture is bringing our culture back I think because people are practicing more dances, cultural traditions because tourists want to see that, so at the same time I think there is a stereotype but also there&#39;s not
