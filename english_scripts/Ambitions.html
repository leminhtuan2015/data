   I have a few main ambitions at the moment. I think the first and foremost ones, seeing as I&#39;m in Japan at the moment studying Japanese, would to be actually to be able to speak the language, but I think that&#39;s pretty
   <span class="audionotes">
    far-fetched
   </span>
   ambition at the moment at the rate I&#39;m going. I think to actually learn this language properly you&#39;d have to live here and be studying at least a year to get to know the language and then another year to get fluent, get the speed up, get the slang in, so I mean I think that&#39;s one of my life ambitions is to learn Japanese. I can&#39;t speak any other languages so just to be able to speak another language would be amazing. I think English, English speaking people have, well, a sort of bad
   <span class="audionotes">
    arrogance
   </span>
   that everyone else speaks English and so why bother to learn another language. It&#39;s not like people in other European countries where, like from a very young age they learn English. They can speak English, maybe French, Spanish, and Italian. Once you got one language
   <span class="audionotes">
    under your belt
   </span>
   it seems to be a lot easier to pick up other languages. So that&#39;s one of the things I&#39;d like to do. My other main wish at the moment, which I hopefully I&#39;m going to
   <span class="audionotes">
    turn into a reality
   </span>
   when I return home is to actually get a job in the animation industry. I did my degree in that and it&#39;s been something that I&#39;ve, you know, I&#39;ve been waiting to actually get to the job stage, the job stage for so long now. Before I came to Japan, I was working, but in a graphic design job which is not what I&#39;m actually wanting to do, so I think my, you know, number one wish at the moment, apart from the Japanese, is to actually be there in the industry I want to be working in, working the way I want to work, you know doing what I do for fun, as a job. That&#39;s my sort of number one ambition. I mean obviously making money is nice but I think at the moment the most important thing in a job is, you know money shouldn&#39;t be the first thing, you should really enjoy what you&#39;re doing. I&#39;ve always said I&#39;d never want to work in an office where you have to wear a suit, where you have to be
   <span class="audionotes">
    constricted
   </span>
   and constrained. You know I want to have my offices, sort of I mean, the environments I&#39;ve, the work environments I&#39;ve seen so far through friends and what I&#39;ve worked in myself is pretty similar to how I think it should be: a group of more friends than colleagues working together on something they&#39;re passionate about. I think that has to be my main aim in life.
