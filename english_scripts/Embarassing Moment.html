  My most embarrassing moment was probably when I lived in Germany. One day I decided to go shopping and I drove into town. I had a car. And I was very, very pleased because I found a parking space immedately which was rather unusual. I did my shopping, which only took half an hour and I went back to my car, and to my absolute horror it was no longer on the ground but it was suspended in the air. I really did not know what to do at this point so I walked back into town and I went to the police station. The police were very kind to me and I was very grateful for that and they interviewed me.  They asked me what had happened and I said &#39;I&#39;m really sorry, I didn&#39;t buy a parking ticket&#39; and they said &#39;We hadn&#39;t even noticed that!&#39;, they said &#39;Do you realise where you had parked?&#39; and I said &#39;Well no, I have no idea&#39; and they said &#39;Well actually you parked into the entrance to a car park and as a result nobody could get out of the car park because you were parked in the entrance&#39;. So I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time then. It was very embarrassing: I hadn&#39;t seen the sign, I hadn&#39;t noticed the car park which was rather silly. Erm, but now my friends think it is really funny when I tell them the story. I also think it&#39;s funny but it was an expensive mistake!
