   Alex:
  </strong>
  What about your personality or your characteristics?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria:
  </strong>
  I would like to be more studious for school because I am not that much of a stay-at-home-all-night-to-study person. I look at my textbook and I really try but then I realize I could be doing something else so I just go out and do something else and I don&#39;t do my homework and I don&#39;t fail because I am at least smart enough to pass but sometimes it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a struggle to get through
  </span>
  . So yes, I would like to be more
  <span class="audionotes">
   studious
  </span>
  and more maybe hesitant in my answers because I talk before I think at some point sometimes. I do like my open personality though, like being for example when we went out partying yesterday, I was talking to everybody which was very nice and people seemed to like that
  <span class="audionotes">
   open-attitude
  </span>
  and as long as you&#39;re not
  <span class="audionotes">
   being open
  </span>
  and arrogant because I try not to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria:
  </strong>
  If you&#39;re being open because you&#39;re interested in the person you&#39;re talking to then you get more positive responses so I do like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  But being so open has caused you problems as well. I remember that guy thought that you liked him because you were so nice to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria:
  </strong>
  That wasn&#39;t supposed to happen. I can&#39;t help it. There was a guy in my school, I don&#39;t know the guy, he&#39;s probably in his forties, who went over and talked to me and it was just impossible for me to say go away so I ended up giving him my phone number and now he calls me every night at half past twelve on my phone which is very loud and very annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Every night?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria:
  </strong>
  When I pick up, well he stopped now because I don&#39;t pick up any more, but in the beginning he just, I
  <span class="audionotes">
   pick up
  </span>
  the phone and he said hi and then I said what do you want and then he said nothing much but how are you, like really he didn&#39;t even want anything. He just wanted to talk to me and yeah that kind of problem happens more than often because I can&#39;t help it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  What would you like to change about your status like a new house, a job, a boyfriend, anything like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria:
  </strong>
  I would not mind finding a nice guy. I would not at all. I don&#39;t know about the specifics and I&#39;m not even sure I can handle a relationship right now, maybe I just want to meet somebody to try and work it out with but that&#39;s probably not the most important thing because I love where I live, I love my study, I don&#39;t have a job and that&#39;s really nice. I do have, I&#39;ve saved up money before traveling so I do have a lot of money right now so I don&#39;t need to work and it&#39;s nice.
 </p>

   Alex:
  </strong>
  At the moment?

   Maria:
