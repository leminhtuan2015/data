   Jessica:
  </strong>
  So Ashley, what are you going to do this summer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ashley:
  </strong>
  I am really excited. This summer I&#39;m going to my Grandparents&#39; 50th wedding anniversary. We are having a huge party and I&#39;m really excited. My entire family is going to be there. they&#39;re renting a house in Lake Tahoe, which is where my mom grew up, and where my grandparents spent the majority of their life together. We&#39;ll be there for a week, on the lake, boating, jet skiing, that whole thing, and then this Saturday we&#39;re having a party with people I&#39;ve never even met. Everyone&#39;s gonna be there. I&#39;m really excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s wonderful. So how many of your family member will be there?
 </p>

   Ashley:
  </strong>
  Oh, gosh, I have no idea. Every time I speak to my mother I hear somebody knew who has been invited and somebody else is going to be there. I&#39;m really excited. It&#39;s going to be a lot of fun. My grandparents are crazy. They actually got engaged a month after they met, and February, the shortest month of the year. My grandfather told my grandmother he loved her a week after they met
  <strong>
   ,
  </strong>
  and then he proposed and then he was in service so he went away until August. They didn&#39;t see each other until they got married. Yeah, my grandmother says, &#34;If any of you kids do this, we&#39;ll kill you. I can&#39;t believe 50 years later they&#39;re still together.
