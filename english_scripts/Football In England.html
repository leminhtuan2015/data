   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Phil, you&#39;re from England and you&#39;re a big football fan.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, very much. Definitely. Football&#39;s one of my main passions in life.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, I&#39;m a huge American football fan, and I know American football there&#39;s a certain process when you go the game that happens on game day. Can you talk about what happens when you go watch a British match, like a Premiere League match? Like what&#39;s the routine from morning to night? Like if you&#39;re a fan?
  <br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  If it&#39;s a home game then I guess I leave about two hours before the game. I arrive at the stadium and go the bar and have like a drink of beer before the game, and then I&#39;ll always wear my football kit: my shirt and my scarf; and then I&#39;ll go the game. I&#39;ll find my normal place in the stand, cause I always stand or sit in the same place. It&#39;s kind of tradition. It&#39;s like my routine, and then for about
  <span class="audionotes">
   half-an-hour
  </span>
  before the game, the stadium starts to fill up, the supporters start to make a lot of noise and they start to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get behind the team
  </span>
  and everyone... the adrenaline&#39;s flowing, and there&#39;s a few opposition supporters and it&#39;s generally kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   banter between the supporters
  </span>
  whilst the players are warming up on the pitch.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, and then what happens like during the game? In British soccer you have a lot of songs, correct?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of songs. Generally they&#39;re either supporting the team or insulting the other team or local rivals.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, right. And like how do you know when to sing? Like somebody just busts out in song or do you have a leader or?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve always wondered this. There&#39;s no
  <span class="audionotes">
   designated leader
  </span>
  but there&#39;s always a group that starts song or, there must be someone who does it, but I&#39;ve never actually never know who or why, but it just seems that everyone
  <span class="audionotes">
   spontaneously
  </span>
  starts to sing at the same time and a certain song.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now is it always the same songs, or do the team come up with new songs from time to time?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  The team doesn&#39;t come up with any of them, the supporters do. Generally there&#39;s a set hard core group of songs for each team that you have and then there&#39;s occasionally specialty songs. If it&#39;s a local derby game against someone you really don&#39;t like, then there&#39;s specialty songs for that game, or a few new ones come up depending on events that have been happening, so maybe one of the players have been in the news recently. They&#39;ll be a song about the player or something.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s cool. So you said &#34;derby&#34;, that&#39;s your team?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Derby is the term when a local game... when you play like your rival team, we call it like a local derby in English football.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s called a local derby.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Derby is also the name of the team, but that&#39;s just coincidence.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. So, derby means when you play your rival team?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you play a local team, a team that&#39;s based near to you. It&#39;s called a derby game.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A derby game. And it&#39;s D-A-R-B-Y?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  D-E.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, so it&#39;s like derby. OK.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Got it.
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  In English, we pronounce it derby, yeah.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Derby! OK, interesting. OK, sorry... Do you ever go the away games?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah, I used to travel quite a lot. I once traveled nine hours to an away game.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  And my team lost that day. And because we lost, we went down to the league below. I was not very happy on the way home.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What a terrible day.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah. But we kind of knew we were going to lose because my team was very bad that year and the opposition was a very strong team so it&#39;s kind of everyone&#39;s attitude. We expected to lose, so we went there in a party spirit anyway so it wasn&#39;t so bad.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, cool. Thanks for talking about the Premiere League.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Anytime, I love football.
