  Jeff, I really don&#39;t understand how sometimes you have so much success with girls when we go out to the bar. It often seems like I&#39;m the one sitting there and not really enjoying the conversation with the other girl&#39;s friend while you really
  <span class="audionotes">
   hit it off
  </span>
  with these women, and you&#39;re able to just walk up and talk to people. I don&#39;t know, maybe I just don&#39;t have the ability to go up and do that. How do you do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s a... there&#39;s no
  <span class="audionotes">
   special formula
  </span>
  I don&#39;t think. I think you have to be a little bit open. You&#39;ve got to be a little bit nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Do you have some
  <span class="audionotes">
   lines
  </span>
  that you use?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think. It all depends on the situation. It depends of the girl and the place and how you&#39;re feeling and what the girl looks like, but I think it helps a lot to have a good wingman. You need a good wingman. If you&#39;re by yourself you look a little bit strange: Why is this guy here in the bar by himself, so you need
  <span class="audionotes">
   a good wingman
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Well, I find when I go out to the bar with you, you&#39;ve been able to meet and talk to some people, yeah, I guess maybe when I go out alone I don&#39;t have quite the same success rate, but then a lot of times, you go out to the bar by yourself and you meet people and then I only hear about it afterwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but I think it&#39;s... if you drink enough beer and you go out with
  <span class="audionotes">
   the right mindset
  </span>
  . Leave all or your parameter at home and everyone is good in their own way.... and if you&#39;re open to everyone, open to having a good time, I think girls can sense that and they like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Or perhaps you&#39;re just strange enough that it doesn&#39;t seem all that different when you&#39;re out by yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Well, it might be that. It might be that.
