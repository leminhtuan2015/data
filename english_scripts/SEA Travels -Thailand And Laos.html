 <strong>
  Todd
 </strong>
 : Abidemi, what did you do for summer break?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : For summer break, I went to visit some countries in Asia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, what countries?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I visited Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, great. What did you do in each country?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : In Thailand, I was there for about a week. I ate a lot of delicious food and I met a lot of many nice people. I loved    Thailand, so I hope to return again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What foods did you eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I don’t remember the names but I just remembered that they were all good. (Laughter)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Thai food is so good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Did you go anymore in Thailand like the beach or the forest?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I was more interested in nature, so I traveled from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and Chang Rai, and I went
  <span class="audionotes">
   trekking
  </span>
  and rode elephants. So that was one of the
  <span class="audionotes">
   highlights
  </span>
  of my trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh nice. How long was the trek?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : The trek was about a day. It was a trek for 2, 3 hours but then we also stayed overnight in a community in the hills. And then the next day, we trekked for a little bit to come back to the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Nice. So was Thailand the first stop?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Yes. It was my first stop. It was supposed to be the shortest stop but I loved it so much that I spent more time there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : After Thailand, where did you go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : From Thailand, I
  <span class="audionotes">
   moved on
  </span>
  by land to Laos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And what did you do in Laos?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : In Laos, I mainly was in the northern part of the country, and I went
  <span class="audionotes">
   zip-lining
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh fun!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : It was fun. So—
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So zip-lining is going flying from
  <span class="audionotes">
   tree to tree
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That’s correct. So that was about two days’ worth of zip-lining, and we stayed overnight in a big tree house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, how fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : It was
  <span class="audionotes">
   quite an experience
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I really enjoyed it.
