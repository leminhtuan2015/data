    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, Peter, can you talk about your country, Sweden, and what is life like in Sweden in winter?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Swedish life in winter is really harsh, especially,
  <span class="audionotes">
   it tends to
  </span>
  get pretty cold, especially around December, January, that&#39;s when it&#39;s really cold. The temperature can actually drop down to twenty minus and so it&#39;s something you have to do, is that you always have to go and buy new clothes, new
  <span class="audionotes">
   thick clothes
  </span>
  in order to survive the winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that sounds pretty crazy. So, in Sweden in winter, what kind of activities do you like to do? What do people do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Well, there are many things you can do, especially in wintertime in Sweden is either you go like sled. So in Sweden, in winter in Sweden, you can actually go sledding and also you can go ice-skating, and of course you can also go skiing up in the mountains, which is really popular among people right now, and also for the young people, you can actually go with a snowboard, but usually around Stockholm
  <span class="audionotes">
   where I&#39;ve been raised
  </span>
  we tend to do very little things because the coldness actually, it&#39;s like an obstacle, because you can&#39;t do much really, mostly you sit home and study or you sit by your computer or you just
  <span class="audionotes">
   hang around
  </span>
  with friends celebrating Christmas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what about the food? Like what foods do people eat in Sweden in winter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  In Sweden in wintertime, we usually eat a lot of meatballs, which is the typical Swedish cuisine. Meatballs, you got potatoes, and of course we got
  <span class="audionotes">
   all kinds of variations
  </span>
  of sausages. We got ham and it&#39;s a little but hard for me know because I can remember so much and it&#39;s been a long time since I was in Sweden.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sounds like a cool place to live. Anyway, thanks, Peter.
