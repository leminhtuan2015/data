  Doron:
 </strong>
 I&#39;m a bit
 <span class="audionotes">
  schizophrenic
 </span>
 when it comes to dates actually cause ... I&#39;ll either do something really boring and cheesy like pizza and a movie.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s not boring.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s traditional then. I&#39;ll say traditional.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  It could be fun but if you&#39;re already at the point where the girl&#39;s like in your house ordering pizza and a movie that&#39;s ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Well, I was talking about eating out and going to the cinema. You already got the guy back to your house. Very forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Well, pizza and a movie sounds like pizza delivery and video rentals, so I see what you mean. I could always go out for a pizza.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  I like doing that but then on the other hand, I also like to do something totally strange and different, like when I was living in Berlin in Germany a couple of years ago, I met a girl I liked and I invited her out for a date, and she surprised me by saying yes, so I had to find something to do and I was bored of movies and pizza so we went to a restaurant near my apartment, but the restaurant was really, really cool because it was totally, totally black. There were no lights.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  You just go in there and order from a menu in the foyer and then you get taken to a table by a blind waiter and you can&#39;t see anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   No way!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  I think they&#39;re quite famous. There&#39;s two or three around the world. One in New York I think, and also in London and it was the craziest experience because you just have to talk, and I think that&#39;s really cool because you don&#39;t look at the person. You don&#39;t care if they&#39;re cute or whatever. You just really get to know them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s cool. Were there lot&#39;s of people there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  It was packed. You had to make a reservation. It was really, really packed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  How could you find your way to the restroom?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  You had to ask. You had to ring a little bell and then a blind waiter would come and take you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  What do you mean a blind waiter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  All of the waiters and the waitresses, and the waiting staff, they were all blind or
  <span class="audionotes">
   partially
  </span>
  sighted.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Not the chefs. I think the chefs could see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  But the staff there, they were partially sighted.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  So they learned the room really well because they could see and they were your guides. It was a really interesting date, just ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s interesting just from the
  <span class="audionotes">
   view point
  </span>
  of experiencing what it would be like to be blind because I think people don&#39;t get to experience that enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Exactly, and to know that maybe when you see someone blind in the street, you think, ah, poor guy, poor girl, but then all of a sudden, they&#39;re the ones that know their way around and you
  <span class="audionotes">
   rely on
  </span>
  them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Melissa:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s really cool.
