   Ruth:
  </strong>
  So, Akane, you&#39;re from Canada, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Tell me about where you live.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  Well, I grew up in Toronto, and it&#39;s quite a big city. In the greater Toronto area, there&#39;s about, I think3 1/2 million people just now and it&#39;s very multicultural and that&#39;s one of the things that I really like about Toronto is that there&#39;re many different people from many different countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  And do you live in Toronto now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  No, actually, I haven&#39;t lived there for a year now I think, almost, actually more than that, because I&#39;ve been travelling and working and what not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Oh, right. What&#39;s your job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m actually a teacher.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Do you teach children or adults?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  Usually I do. I am mostly trained to teach younger children, but recently I&#39;ve begun teaching older students, or young adults, and I quite enjoy it actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  So which do you prefer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  Well, they both have good parts and bad parts and I think in the future I would like to do a bit of both.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Do you know where you would like to live in the future?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  I have no idea. I would like to travel to different places and maybe I&#39;ll eventually settle back down in Toronto, where I&#39;m from.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Do you have family in Toronto?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  Not at the moment, no. My parents moved to Vancouver and that&#39;s where they live right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Ah, Vancouver, is that in Canada was well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. It&#39;s on the West Coast of Canada and the weather is much warmer there and that&#39;s why my parents like it there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow, it sounds nice.
 </p>
