   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I understand you recently rode a train from Milwaukee to Minneapolis. Was this the first time you ever rode a train?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  No, I have been on a train many times as a young person but recently in the past 3 or 4 years I have ridden a train again several times. There was a period of time in my life that I did not ride the train, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  How is it different riding the train now then it was back when you were younger?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  When I was younger they had a different set of train people. Back then, you weren&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   served
  </span>
  meals at your seat. You had, if they had a
  <span class="audionotes">
   dining car
  </span>
  , if they had a dining car, you could go into the dining car and eat but some trains, especially on short distances, like when I lived in Jaffy, Missouri, it was
  <span class="audionotes">
   halfway
  </span>
  between Memphis and St. Louis. Those were short routes and they did not have dining cars. On this trip that we just
  <span class="audionotes">
   got back from
  </span>
  yesterday, we had our, we were in the lower car because it&#39;s a handicap car. My sister is
  <span class="audionotes">
   handicapped
  </span>
  , and they brought us a menu, and they brought us a full dinner, including salad and dessert and coffee or tea, whatever we would like to drink.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  How was the food on the train? Was it better than plain food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  Oh, much better. Much better. It was fixed. The chef&#39;s did a fantastic job and I understand that it is cooked on the train. It may not be all cooked on the train but it certainly is prepared and the salads are prepared on the train so that you don&#39;t get these package food tastes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  That sounds fun though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  Oh, it was great fun! We enjoyed every minute of it.
