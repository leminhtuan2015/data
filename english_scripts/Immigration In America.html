   Yuri:
  </strong>
  So, Todd, what about the situation with immigration in the United States? Is it similar to Italy or different?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, from what you&#39;re saying it sounds really similar. The U.S. has a lot of immigration, and it&#39;s very controversial now in America, probably because the economy is going bad but we get a lot of people from Latin America or Central America and they either cross the border through Mexico, the Mexican border, or they come by boat similar to Italy. So yeah, it&#39;s kind of a big problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yuri:
  </strong>
  I have a question, please. I understand that a lot of the population, they are actually from South America or Central America. Do people now start to teach Spanish at schools?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, the language is very controversial. We are taught Spanish actually, but they do a very bad job. Most people can&#39;t speak Spanish. But most of the immigrants actually, I think that come to the U.S., do a really good job of learning English. The first generation
  <span class="audionotes">
   struggles
  </span>
  , but always the
  <span class="audionotes">
   second generation
  </span>
  , their children, become bilingual rather quickly, so even though we try to learn Spanish, I think the fact is in reality people that come to America, just learn English really quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yuri:
  </strong>
  One more question please. When a foreigner comes to the United States and finds a job. He get a job, he has the same amount of money he can earn as an American or not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ooh, that&#39;s interesting. I don&#39;t think you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   discriminate pay
  </span>
  for a lower paying job whether you&#39;re an American or not. I think most Employers probably pay the same wage, but what happens is is only people that are new to the country often will take certain jobs. So, for example maybe you know work as janitors or work in fast food companies or maybe farm work, sometimes construction. The pay is not that great, so they offer a really low wage so only people that just arrive to America or immigrants will apply for the job. So it is kind of a problem because some people think if there weren&#39;t so many people coming into the country, then people that were born in the country would
  <span class="audionotes">
   apply for
  </span>
  the those jobs and be paid more, so it&#39;s a very controversial thing. But in reality, in terms of history economically, the country was
  <span class="audionotes">
   built on
  </span>
  foreign labor coming in so, you know, that&#39;s just a fact. The country was developed by having immigrants come into the country so economically it&#39;s very important I think.
 </p>

   Yuri:

  Alright, thank you very much Todd.
