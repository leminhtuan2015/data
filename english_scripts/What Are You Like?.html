   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Matt, we&#39;re gonna talk about adjectives. The theme this week is adjectives, so first of all, when it comes to time, are you normally late or are you always punctual?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Always
  <span class="audionotes">
   punctual
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Always punctual.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I find it very annoying when people are late. I tend to be punctual.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I follow kind of a pattern
  </span>
  of my dad and my grandfather. My grandfather used to sit in the car for an hour before church, just sitting in the car waiting for the rest of the family to go and my father was the same way, and I used to abhor that type of behavior but actually as I&#39;ve grown older
  <span class="audionotes">
   I found it annoying
  </span>
  to be late and when I&#39;m waiting for people and they end up being late, it kind of gets under my skin so I&#39;ve kind of always followed the punctual route.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Thanks. OK. OK, now let&#39;s move on to money. Now would you consider yourself to be generous with money and time or stingy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Usually stingy, because I have always been single and I&#39;ve always been generous with people, like that I have loved and, you know, my family but I kind of just basically take care of myself and I&#39;ve never had expendable income where I&#39;ve been able to donate and give money to causes. You know I would love to do that sort of thing but I never have been able to so I&#39;ve always been careful with my money and I don&#39;t take a lot, you know, to live on, and I don&#39;t have a lot of vices so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, cool Matt. OK, and now let&#39;s talk about personality. Let&#39;s say if you go to a party or you&#39;re meeting people, would you say that you&#39;re outgoing or you&#39;re shy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  Generally I&#39;m out going, depending on the alcohol involved. I&#39;m actually kind of shy when I first enter a party like most people and I sort of seek out to find that person or that group of people that I know, but yeah, usually I&#39;m fairly outgoing and I like talking to people and meeting new people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Matt the last one, we&#39;re talking about work or maybe just personal time. Would you say that you&#39;re lazy or that you are hard-working?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matt:
  </strong>
  I would say I&#39;m hard-working, mainly at work but I&#39;m very lazy when there is nothing to do, when I have no function in life, when there is nothing going on on the weekends I tend to be very lazy and it&#39;s hard to motivate unless I&#39;ve got like a strict goal that I want to achieve or something I need to do, I tend to
  <span class="audionotes">
   putter around
  </span>
  and do very little
  <span class="audionotes">
   unless I&#39;m forced to
  </span>
