  Lindsay:
 </strong>
 So if you buy a game, how long does it take you to beat the game? One year or fifteen hours or what?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, maybe the shortest one are only about six hours but it all depends on how much you&#39;re playing it. If it&#39;s something I really like, sometimes I can&#39;t put it down and I just keep playing it and I finish it in a few days and sometimes, well, it&#39;s alright but
  <span class="audionotes">
   I can&#39;t get myself to keep playing
  </span>
  it so sometimes it can take me a few months to finish a game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. So do you think you&#39;re a very skillful video game player?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;m pretty bad sometimes, especially at the newer games. I&#39;m better at the old ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  One final question, do you think it&#39;s more important to beat the actual video game or when you&#39;re playing with someone to beat the person that you&#39;re playing with?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   What do you mean?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  So, you know, when you&#39;re friend comes over and you&#39;re both playing the video games together and you&#39;re competing against one each other, or is it better to actually like beat the video game itself? Does that
  <span class="audionotes">
   make sense
  </span>
  ? Don&#39;t you usually against your friend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sometimes I play against my friends, but it seems like there&#39;s less goal to it when you&#39;re playing against someone else. You win sometimes and you lose sometimes, but once you finish the game, then you can feel like
  <span class="audionotes">
   you&#39;ve accomplished something
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Have you ever been so addicted to a game, and then you finished it and you were disappointed because you liked the game so much?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Actually, that happens a lot. Sometimes you finish a game that you really like and you wish there were more games that you could keep playing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  OK, that happens to me but that&#39;s when I am reading a book, or yeah, usually when I&#39;m reading a book or finish a long project but I can&#39;t imagine that happening with a video game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s exactly the same as with a book or with a TV series or something else that you really enjoy. When it&#39;s finished...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   It&#39;s bitter sweet
  </span>
  , right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yes, exactly.
