   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Hi! This is Jessica and today I&#39;m going to talk about spaghetti. Now a lot of people think that is might just be really easy to make, but let me tell you, mine is the
  <span class="audiodef">
   top of the top
  </span>
  . It&#39;s, I can make a
  <span class="audiodef">
   mean spaghetti
  </span>
  . So first, I take and I cut up garlic. Garlic is essential.
  <span class="audiodef">
   As much garlic as you can possibly stand
  </span>
  to cut, and then I cut some onion and put that all together, and fry it with olive oil. Then basically after that point, it kind of varies. It just depends on whatever vegetables I have around. Usually I put in like green peppers, definitely mushrooms. Mushrooms are a must. Um, let&#39;s see, and then basically it depends on the time of the year, so if it&#39;s summer I&#39;ll just put in like squash and, so I saute all the vegetables up, and get them to the point where they are just right and then I put oregano in hopefully, hopefully, the best is if it&#39;s fresh but, you know, you can&#39;t have it all so, you put in oregano, and then from there, I put in, and I hope my dad&#39;s not listening because he&#39;ll never eat it after this point, but I put in tofu ground beef, so you can&#39;t really taste it, um, I mean you can taste it. It tastes like beef, but nobody knows that it&#39;s tofu, just because I don&#39;t particularly like raw meat, so Tofu I think is
  <span class="audiodef">
   the way to go
  </span>
  , so then, um, so I put that in there, and you don&#39;t really have to cook it, you just warm it up, so I just cook it all together, warm it all together. And then I put in some fresh tomatoes, and then I usually use like a half a can of whatever tomato sauce is on sale, whatever pasta sauce, and then again a little more oregano, and just let it
  <span class="audiodef">
   simmer
  </span>
  to absorb all the flavor. That&#39;s it.

  Todd:
 </strong>
 John, so you&#39;re wife taught us how to make tacos.
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  She&#39;s a good woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Can you make anything?

   John:
  </strong>
  Yeah, my favorite food is Mexican food. So I can make a pretty good Mexican chicken casserole.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, first of all, what are the ingredients?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Let&#39;s see. Well, you need chicken, chili powder, rice, canned mushroom soup, and lots of cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and how do you make it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Basically, you cook the chicken. You can like grill it or bake it. Whatever you want and you strip it into pieces and then you cook the rice and then you take the rice and the chicken and the mushroom soup and the cheese and the chili powder and you basically mix it all together in a big slop and then you put it in a casserole dish and throw it in the oven.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow, sounds pretty good. How long does it take to make?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  You could do it in about an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  An hour!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s pretty fast
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  An hour or under an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, have you made it recently?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John:
  </strong>
  No, I haven&#39;t made it in awhile. It&#39;s hard to find all the ingredients. Cream of mushroom soup is, I don&#39;t see it that often in Japan.
