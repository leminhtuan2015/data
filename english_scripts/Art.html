   Todd:
  </strong>
  Shona, do you consider yourself an artist?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  No, actually, I wouldn&#39;t use that word. I don&#39;t like when people use that word cause like artist to me is like someone who is like famous for like creating something like, there&#39;s like being a creator or a designer and there&#39;s being like an artist, and an artist like is
  <span class="audionotes">
   someone who&#39;s celebrated
  </span>
  for what they do, so I&#39;m not really celebrated for what I do but I do like to sort of like make things, so I like to paint and I like to draw and I like to like create things and design things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what kind of things do you like to paint?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  OK, well the kind of paintings I do are like based on like three things I&#39;ve noticed over this time that I&#39;ve been doing it. There&#39;re based on color. Color is like so important to me. I like really bright colors. I like colors that kind of clash together that might not go. Also, I like shapes. Shape is like the most important thing to me. I like the shapes of sea horses, of butterflies, of like flowers, of natural things, of like the human form. Shape is like the biggest deal to me. I also like repetition in what I do, so I kind of repeat the same shape or like I&#39;ll repeat like part of a shape, like it will appear in many different parts of a painting that I&#39;ll do, so these are like the most important things, and they&#39;re kind of like, I suppose can end of a kind of bit sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   psychedelic
  </span>
  or a bit crazy like, but like if you kind of look at them closely you&#39;ll see what they&#39;re made up of.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty interesting. So, do you like then, let&#39;s say, you know, architecture that uses patterns and things like that or do you just like painting as a medium on a piece of canvas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I like kind of all forms of art really. I like architecture. I like.. what I like to see is like where there&#39;s like an old building right next to a new one, like and you can see like maybe if the new one&#39;s slightly in front of the old one. You can see like the differences overlapping. I like things that overlap. It sounds a bit weird but.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You like layers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I like layers. Exactly. I like
  <span class="audionotes">
   collages
  </span>
  as well, although I don&#39;t do them myself. I find it too difficult to actually do them. I like appreciate a collage because I like the fact that it&#39;s built up. It&#39;s like layered. It&#39;s more interesting to look at.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  One thing that I think is really amazing is that, cause I do the web stuff, I do the web design, and I&#39;m a
  <span class="audionotes">
   novice
  </span>
  . Like yourself, I&#39;m not really an artist but I&#39;m always amazed how computers can&#39;t replicate the same colors of nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You&#39;ll see certain browns or purples or blues and you just can&#39;t get it on a computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Exactly. I know. It&#39;s like, it&#39;s difficult, like, cause nature is like so much more beautiful than anything anyone can ever create, you know, so sometimes it&#39;s kind of frustrating, especially like if I&#39;m just drawing like something in nature, like a scene. Like
  <span class="audionotes">
   there&#39;s no way
  </span>
  it&#39;s going to be as beautiful as what I can see with my own eyes in front of me, and it can be a bit frustrating sometimes, like the same with trying to find colors that match nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s pretty hard, although it does seem that a really good artist on canvas can get pretty close with the colors.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, they can get close. You have to be really good at you&#39;re mixing. You see that&#39;s one of the like skills involved with painting. You&#39;ve got to be able to like mix paints really well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And can you mix paints really well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m getting there.
