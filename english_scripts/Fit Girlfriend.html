  Meg
 </strong>
 : Hey, Todd. I was talking to your girlfriend and she seems really fit.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. She&#39;s very fit. It&#39;s kind of a problem actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh really? Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, she watches what she eats and she&#39;s very careful about the food she eats. So she doesn&#39;t eat meat, she doesn&#39;t eat fast food. She doesn&#39;t eat sugar. She doesn&#39;t drink coffee. So because she doesn&#39;t eat or drink all these foods, it&#39;s kind of hard if we go out to dinner or if I want to eat something because then I feel guilty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Do you also not eat those foods?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No. Are you kidding? I mean, I always eat fast food and I love to eat sweets and stuff like that. So we both love exercise, right. So she exercises a lot. I exercise a lot. She exercises more than I do but yeah, the diet thing is kind of a hassle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So what do you think I should do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Maybe you should also try to be healthy because it sounds like a good idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, maybe. I&#39;ll give it a try. But the thing is, you know, she â€“ there&#39;s one other problem. She eats five small meals a day, so never eats big meals. So we can&#39;t go to a restaurant and stuff like that. So it&#39;s just really hard to adjust. I mean, I love a big breakfast, you know. She never eats a big breakfast. She always eats these small little meals, so yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Well maybe, you can cook at home together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Maybe. Or maybe I should just get a new girlfriend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Maybe. Good luck.
