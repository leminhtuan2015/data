  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Okay, John, let&#39;s talk about fashion. You know, I have students and I think sometimes they don&#39;t, they don&#39;t dress appropriately for the classroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah. Sometimes, it looks like students are wearing the clothes which they will plan to wear at night, to go out and go to a party with friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So actually, I think school uniforms are great. I would make the teachers wear the school uniform, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : I agree with you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Because I think when we talk about appropriate clothing, I think girls very often
  <span class="audionotes">
   take most of the blame
  </span>
  for that. But I think it&#39;s our society, and we can fix the problem by having a uniform for girls and boys and teachers, and we can feel like part of a team.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : I know there are a lot of problems of school uniform. First of all, students don&#39;t want to all dress the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : But there&#39;s other problems. Usually, when schools have a uniform, the boys wear pants and the girls have to wear a dress or a skirt. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I agree. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair either. I think a lot of schools these days they can let the girls choose. And so the girls can wear shorts or pants.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, that&#39;s good. I think even beyond the pants or a skirt issue, there should be some
  <span class="audionotes">
   flexibility
  </span>
  to
  <span class="audionotes">
   customize
  </span>
  your uniform, whether you want to wear shirts that are a different color, even if they&#39;re in the same style. Or you want to have some pins or patches or some other accessories.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Do you think as a teacher, would you say something to your student if your student if your student came to class and maybe, for example, it was a boy and his pants were very low and you could see his underwear. Or maybe it was a girl and you thought, &#34;Oh no, her shorts are a little too short.&#34; What do you think you would do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Hmm, wow, that&#39;s a difficult question. I have to say, I don&#39;t think I have been in that situation. I guess I&#39;m lucky enough my students haven&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   pushed the limit
  </span>
  too far. But I feel that I would say something if a student came to class in clothing that was, in my opinion, too
  <span class="audionotes">
   inappropriate
  </span>
  . I would ask them to, probably to, if not leave the class, at least don&#39;t wear clothes like that next time.
 </p>
 <p>
  What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Well, I had a student, and he came to class with a jacket. And it looks like a very expensive jacket but it had a very bad word written on the jacket.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : And after class finished, I told him to, &#34;Wait, please.&#34; And I told him that he probably shouldn&#39;t wear that jacket to class, or maybe, he shouldn&#39;t wear it anymore at all. It just isn&#39;t very appropriate. And he came to class next time and he had the jacket but he had taken it to a shop and they had taken the bad word off of the jacket.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, I was very happy to see that, that he changed his
  <span class="audionotes">
   behavior
  </span>
  and now he could dress the way he liked but also be appropriate.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, that sounds very good. That&#39;s very effective.
 </p>
