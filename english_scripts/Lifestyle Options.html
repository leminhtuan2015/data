   Sarah
  </b>
  : All right, Adam. So we’re going to talk about lifestyle choices. First question for you is would you rather have a roommate or live alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : I’ve had some really good experiences with roommates, but right now I live alone. And I really enjoy to have my own space and I like to keep it a certain way. I’m kind of a clean person, so I probably choose to live alone.

 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Okay. That leads me to my next question which is house or apartment. So if you choose to live alone, would you like a house or an apartment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : I’d love to live in a house. Right now I live in an apartment and it’s okay. But yeah, I really like the outdoors, and like to have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   yard
  </span>
  or a small garden or something would be great. So I love, like, privacy. I like to play my music really loud or something, so in a house maybe I could do that. And in an apartment, it’s a bit difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : So a house usually means a pretty big commitment of like where you’re living. So if you could have a house anywhere where would it be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Maybe in my hometown. It would be nice to have a house in Seattle. But I am not a person that likes to be
  <span class="audionotes">
   tied down
  </span>
  so much, so that would be kind of tricky for me. Apartments are also nice too because you don’t have the
  <span class="audionotes">
   upkeep
  </span>
  and the responsibility that you might have with a house. So that is nice. I wish I could just have a house and just move it with me wherever I go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : So if you could move that house anywhere, would it be like a town or a city, like what do you prefer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : I’d definitely live outside of the city, but close enough to where I could commute within like 20 minutes, 30 minutes to be able to go shopping and do my everyday life. But I like
  <span class="audionotes">
   peace and quiet
  </span>
  and nature, so definitely outside of the
  <span class="audionotes">
   hustle and bustle
  </span>
  of the big city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : So how about pets? Would you like to have a pet or not have anything or one live in your house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : I love animals. I have always wanted to have a dog or really, any sort of pet. But I move so much that it makes having a pet difficult. So I’ve never really had one although if I ever do
  <span class="audionotes">
   settle down
  </span>
  somewhere, I would absolutely get maybe several pets. I love, I love animals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Nice. Thanks.
