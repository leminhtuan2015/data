   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Alexandra, you said that you were born in Miami.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes, I was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you still live there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes, I am, I do live there, now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Has the city changed a lot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Actually it has. As a young kid, there was a lot more freedom as a child to just run around your neighborhood or ride your bike, go to school without being
  <span class="audiodef">
   escorted
  </span>
  by a parent or going on a bus, you could walk to school or ride your bike to school. Now there are so many more people in the city and the
  <span class="audiodef">
   demographics
  </span>
  have changed due to a hurricane we had about ten or twelve years ago, and so it&#39;s, the parents now have to be more
  <span class="audiodef">
   vigilant
  </span>
  with their children. Be more careful. There&#39;s more people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You said a hurricane changed the demographics.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alexandra:
  </strong>
  Yes, in, Hurricane Andrew had come into Florida, lower, southern Florida, and had completely demolished this south of Miami, a city called homestead, and all those residents moved up to Miami, and many of the residents in Miami that had damage from the hurricane moved up to the next county up. So you have a completely different demographic coming in. Many people from other parts that were affected in South Florida also moved up, and also the people that are originally in Miami, some even moved out of the state. They had enough of hurricanes. You get a category five which is probably the strongest hurricane there is, blow through and completely destroy your home, you really don&#39;t want
  <span class="audiodef">
   to stick around
  </span>
  anymore for another taste, so and also Miami has become a very popular place to come and live and work, so you have an increase in population, and different types of population. As I said before there&#39;s many different people&#39;s from different countries and every so often you have a
  <span class="audiodef">
   new wave
  </span>
  of immigrants coming in, so it changes things.
