   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Jessica, what are your plans for the summer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  This summer! I think I&#39;m going to go on a trip with my brother to Argentina. Uh, we are still making the plans to go but I think we&#39;re going to go for two weeks. And we&#39;re probably going to go from Chicago, because that&#39;s where he lives, to Buenos Aires and then go north to the city of Cordoba, which is the second largest city in Argentina, so, and then from there I&#39;d really like to go and see some gauchos, which are Argentine cowboys, so I think that that would be really cool, and have some barbeque and see everything that we can, so..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool! Are you going to work your way down to the southern tip?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to just because I have a buddy of mine that lives in the north, in Cordoba, and I think it&#39;s so far from the north to the south, just cause it&#39;s such a long country that he said by bus it would take something like some ungodly amount of hours and so, I don&#39;t know, in two weeks, I think that would be a little bit ambitious, to try to cover it all so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, do you know anybody in Argentina?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, my one friend who lives there. I definitely want to go there and visit him. Oh, so your friend already lives there.
