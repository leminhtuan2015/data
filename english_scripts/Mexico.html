   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Adrienne, you said you lived in Mexico for awhile?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Mm, I studied there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really! You studied in Mexico?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I did. I studied Spanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, so what was it like being a student in Mexico?
 </p>
 <p>

   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Ah, it was interesting. The weather was really hot the entire time I was there. Um, and it was very confusing, cause I didn&#39;t know the language very well when I first arrived but I learned quickly because I was living in the situation every day where I had to use language so that was really helpful in the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what were the people like? What was the city like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  The city was small. 1 million people, and that&#39;s pretty small.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  The architecture is very colonial style. It&#39;s interesting. Very beautiful, old, a lot of wood and stone and the food was great. Very spicy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mexican food&#39;s the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I think so too
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and the people?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  The people are really friendly, really, really friendly. Big families and they&#39;re always inviting you over for dinner, lunch and breakfast, and tea and coffee and chocolate and it&#39;s really, it&#39;s really a very familial environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What was your favorite place in Mexico?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  My favorite place, still, is a town called Cholula. It&#39;s a very small town. That has a pyramid, and Aztec pyramid with a cathedral on top of it and it has views of the mountains, the volcano and, um, just beautiful landscape all around. It&#39;s a great place to watch the sunset.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What volcano?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Po! They call it Popo, but the full name I think is Popocatepetl. It&#39;s an Aztec name.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, sounds like a nice place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Any plans to go back to Mexico soon?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Of course. I always want to go back but whether I actually make it in the next year or two, I don&#39;t know.
