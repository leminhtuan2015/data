  Olga
 </strong>
 : Hey, Daniel, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Hey Olga, I&#39;m fine thanks. How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Fine. Actually I have a favor to ask you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yes, sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : OK. Like my boyfriend and I are planning to go to Chile next month.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yes, so I was trying to ask if you could recommend us some place to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : All over Chile. Actually we&#39;re planning to go to three places because we&#39;re planning to go to Chile for around one month so I think we have enough time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : So have you been to South America before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : No, never.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Never?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : No, we&#39;ve never been outside of Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Wow, so this is going to be your first time in South America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Good. Well
  <span class="audionotes">
   it depends
  </span>
  what you want to do. You said about a month and also it depends on how much money you&#39;re taking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : We have been saving around like one year money so I think we have enough money to, you know, just travel around and don&#39;t worry about money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK, good, because I think if you go to the right places you can save a lot of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Because if you go, you know, to like big fancy restaurants, you&#39;re going to take a lot of money but I can give you a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   tips
  </span>
  so you can save money and also have I think a much better time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : That would be great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK. So I can recommend you about three places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : The first one would be in the north.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : We have a desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : So if you are OK with the
  <span class="audionotes">
   heat
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;m OK. I&#39;m from Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK, that&#39;s good then. It&#39;s called Atacama Desert and we have a lot of really, really nice places there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : There&#39;s a place called San Pedro de Atacama. There&#39;s another one called The Valley of the Moon and it&#39;s supposed to be, it&#39;s supposed to look like the moon actually, that&#39;s why the name.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : It sounds so romantic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : It is. I&#39;ve never been with my girlfriend but it should be romantic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : There&#39;s also a lot of mountains and if you go to a couple of places near
  <span class="audionotes">
   the Andes
  </span>
  you can see a lot of beautiful lakes and you will also have to be careful with the
  <span class="audionotes">
   altitude
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Oh, right, yeah, because I come from a really low place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
