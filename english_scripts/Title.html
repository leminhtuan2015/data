   Todd:
  </strong>
  Lois, actually how old are you Lois?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m 25.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, 25, so, do you have any early childhood memories? What&#39;s the earliest thing you can remember from Childhood?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Uh, my memories from my choldhood aren&#39;t very good. I can&#39;t remeber that much, but I do remember one thing. I must have only been about 3 or 4, I&#39;m not sure, and I was on holiday with my family, and my grandparents and I had an ice cream and I wanted to climb to the top of this hill, and my parentes were like,&#34; No, No, No. Wait until you finish your ice cream, and then you can go&#34; and I was like, &#34;Nope, I&#39;m going to go now&#34; so I climbed to the top of the hill. It was only a small hill, I was only little and then I dediced it would be great to run down the hill really fast, which I did, and I ran to the bottom of the hill, fell over, ice cream all over me, and I don&#39;t think I got another ice cream after that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh that&#39;s funny, and other memories from childhood.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I think I also remember pushing my brothers around in my brother&#39;s pram and him falling out and banging his head and there being lots of blood. I think I might have got is a lot of trouble for that one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh! So you have a younger brother?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I have a younger brother and I have an older brother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  So I&#39;m the middle child, which is not always good because when we used to go on holiday my brothers would always fight in the car, so I always had to sit in the middle of them so if they were fighting I could stop the fighting, so I didn&#39;t like being the middle child.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I sure you served a good purpose for your parents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Well, I hope so, but still my brothers are now 27 and 23 and they still fight now, so I didn&#39;t actually manage to stop that.
