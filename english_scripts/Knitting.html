   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So we just had Christmas and I see your knitting bag is out, did you knit anything for anyone for Christmas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  I started to knit for my granddaughters, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   time caught up with me
  </span>
  and I was making for them a poncho which consisted of two pieces, two oblong pieces which I will put together and make a poncho.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  That sounds pretty I think, but what will it look like when it&#39;s finished? Can you describe it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  A poncho is sort of like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   shawl
  </span>
  , only it is closed. You can wear it like a sweater. You pull it over your head but you don&#39;t have any arms. You just have the shawl affect.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, I&#39;ve seen those. Those are actually quite popular now. So what colors did you make?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  I made a mixture of sand colors that&#39;s tan and browns and darker browns, sort of a mixture. It&#39;s a nice pretty soft
  <span class="audionotes">
   yarn
  </span>
  in the same colors. It just blends in.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, sounds great. I&#39;m sure your granddaughter will love that. What else did you start to make?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  Well, I wanted to make also, I bought some ponchos and I started to put an
  <span class="audionotes">
   edging
  </span>
  around them but with crocheting, but it didn&#39;t look right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s crocheting?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  Crocheting is another needle, single needle, that you stick into the wool, and use a thread and you pull it through and you can make decoration on anything that you have knitted, only you use a different needle, and a different method of decoration, but it didn&#39;t look right so I pulled it all out and it was fun trying out those things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So when will you finish the, all of these projects do you think? Do you have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   deadline
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vivian:
  </strong>
  Yes, I do, very shortly, I&#39;m almost through
  <br>
