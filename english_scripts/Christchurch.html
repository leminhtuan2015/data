   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Hello!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Hi!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Can you say your name please?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Gabrielle:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Gabrielle. Now, Gabrielle you talked to us last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you said that you&#39;re from Christchurch?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh, from Christchurch in New Zealand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, can you talk about your city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Absolutely! Absolutely! Well, Christchurch I guess compared to Japan is pretty small, but for New Zealand it&#39;s quite a big city. I think it&#39;s a great place. Yeah, we&#39;ve got the beach, the mountains, yeah so city center and nature, really close.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sounds nice! How many people live in Christchurch?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s a good question. Gosh! Were certainly not up to a million! I guess about 600,000 people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s it! Just 6!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s it. Big city in New Zealand!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! So there&#39;s three big cities in New Zealand!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right! That&#39;s right! We&#39;re probably the second or third biggest city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uh, what&#39;s the transportation like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Well, I use my bike usually or a car. We certainly don&#39;t have the trains like Tokyo, but there&#39;s a bus system. It&#39;s not too bad, but most Kiwis have cars. Yeah, more convenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now can I ask you about costs?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Sure! Sure!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and you can say Japanese yen prices.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Yeah! Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How much is an apartment? A one bedroom apartment, downtown?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Well, to be honest we don&#39;t have that style. We&#39;ve got plenty of space so we usually rent a house which has three bedrooms and a garden, for example, and much cheaper, much, much cheaper. I&#39;m just trying to convert.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Three bedrooms and a garden!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Yeah! And often we go &#34;flatting&#34; which means we share the house with maybe a couple of friends, probably pay about, I was paying $80 a week for my room so, oh, sorry my conversion rate is not working too quickly at the moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s really cheap though!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s incredibly cheap. Yeah, much, much cheaper! Much bigger!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! sounds like a nice place! OK, how much is, New Zealand prices OK, how much is a loaf of bread?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  A loaf of bread! To get the good bread, probably about $2.50 a loaf, yeah, so, maybe about, oh sorry, my conversion&#39;s not working, I&#39;ve been in Tokyo for too long!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How about a movie ticket?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  A movie ticket would be about $13, so it&#39;s much cheaper than here. Yeah, definitely!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And bus fare!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Bus fare, a dollar fifty, two dollars for one way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How about if you&#39;re going to buy your friend a sweater, a nice sweater, how much would that cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Well, I like the good outdoor brand sweaters so I would probably say about $50 but an everyday sweater you could get about $15 New Zealand. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Wow! Sounds like a great place. Oh, and last one, the weather, when is the best time of year to visit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Oh, summer, definitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So that&#39;s December?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so we&#39;re going into summer now so December to February, but we have four seasons in one day, so you can count on all weather even within summer. Yeah! Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you have a really bad month to go, where the weather is not nice?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  Yeah, usually June, July, it probably rains the most, but we still get gorgeous sunny days in the winter so, yeah there&#39;s not really any bad time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, sounds nice! Thanks Gabrielle!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gabrielle:
  </strong>
  No, problem!
  <br>
  No, problem!
 </p>
 <p>
