  Todd
 </strong>
 : Hey, Meg. I have a big favor. Can you help me out?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Sure, what do you need?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : My parents are coming to visit me but I can&#39;t go to the airport to pick them up. I have an important appointment. Do you think you can go to the airport and pick them up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, absolutely. But what do your parents look like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Well, they look kind of unique actually, so you can&#39;t miss them. My dad, he&#39;s really tall, and he&#39;s really hairy. He&#39;s got big kind afro-like hair and he&#39;s got facial. He&#39;s got a Fu Manchu so he has a mustache and a little goatee, and he&#39;s kind of muscular.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow. So I think I should be able to see your dad very easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. So you can&#39;t miss him. And also my mom is pretty easy. She&#39;s like kind of sixtyish. She&#39;s in her 60&#39;s and she kind of has blondish grayish hair. She&#39;s kind of medium build. And she&#39;s kind of average height.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Okay. Well, it sounds like no problem. I think I can find them at the airport.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. There will be one other person with them and she might be the one actually looking around trying to find you. And that&#39;s my niece.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, what does your niece look like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. So she&#39;s in her 20&#39;s. She&#39;s very thin, and she has long blond hair. And yeah, she&#39;s quite energetic, so you&#39;ll probably see her running around. So I have a feeling she&#39;s going to be the one looking for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Okay, great. Then I&#39;ll look for your niece.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay, great. I really appreciate this.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : No problem.
