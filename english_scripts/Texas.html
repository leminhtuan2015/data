   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Ivan, where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from Texas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Texas!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yep

   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what&#39;s the difference between Texas and Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Texas is big and Japan is little.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, how about the food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  The food! In Texas we eat a lot of steak, we eat a lot of meat, a lot of beans, a lot of bad stuff for you, but it tastes good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what kind of food do you prefer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  You know it&#39;s funny. I go back to Texas sometimes and I can&#39;t eat that anymore. I&#39;m so used to the
  <br>
  lighter meals: the fish and stuff here. Um, what do I like more? Sometimes I like chili, sometimes I like sushi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, how does the weather compare with Texas and Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Ah, I&#39;m from Houston, Texas which is in the south and that&#39;s just hot, hot, hot. Never had a white Christmas in Houston. The average is about 41, 41 degrees in the summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Whoa!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so it rains a lot more here too. I still can&#39;t get used to all the rain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Houston is pretty close to Mexico, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually, it&#39;s a nine hour drive, well not nine, maybe six. I used to go down there back in high school. Me and my buddies would go. There&#39;s no drinking age in Mexico. Beer is about 25 cents or 30 yen over there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what do you remember about your trips to Mexico?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Not much, which is why we went. We just went. It was called a border town. Basically they just exist
  <br>
  to take care of high school and college kids that want to party for a couple of nights. It&#39;s not really nice but it&#39;s cheap and it&#39;s fun.
