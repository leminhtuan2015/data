    Todd:
   </strong>
   Hey, Akane, the other day we were coming home on the bus
   <strong>
   </strong>
   and I got off the bus and I thought you were on the same bus as us, but when I started walking home, you weren&#39;t around. What happened?

   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well, it&#39;s kind of a funny story actually. I fell asleep on the bus and I was so tired that afternoon. It was a Friday afternoon and I&#39;d had a long week and just fell deep into sleep and I really didn&#39;t notice when we were at the end of the bus ride and we were at the station, and then I was really upset because the bus driver didn&#39;t say anything and so I just kept sleeping and by the time I woke up and noticed we were on our way back to the school again.
   <strong>
   </strong>
   Yes, and I didn&#39;t get a chance to press the button and get off until I was almost halfway to the school, so I ended up getting home really late and even more tired and it wasn&#39;t a very good experience at all.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Did you say anything to the bus driver when you got off?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   No, I didn&#39;t because I was so flustered and I was in a rush to get off that I didn&#39;t really get to say anything.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, that must have been so annoying.

    Akane:
   </strong>
   It was.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So what time did you actually make it home?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   I think it was around 7:30, maybe.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Well, the next time we come home, I&#39;ll look for you and I&#39;ll make sure to wake you up.

    Akane
   </strong>
   : For sure, and make sure to look in the back seat and make sure I&#39;m not lying down horizontally because I think that&#39;s maybe how the bus driver missed out on the fact I was there.
