  Todd:
 </strong>
 Ivan, we are talking about your country, Indonesia. Can you recommend three Indonesian foods for people that visit your country?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Ooh, that can be a difficult question because we have lots of variety of foods and
  <span class="audionotes">
   it depends on your taste
  </span>
  . I mean, if you like sweet foods we have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   specialty
  </span>
  for that and if you like spicy food also there’s a specialty for that, salty, anything, anything you want. But usually people go for… OK, first is Nasi Goreng. Nasi Goreng is a fried rice and I think it’s quite popular anywhere else in the world if it goes for… if you want to promote Indonesian food. Yeah…

  And then next one is Mi Goreng. Mi goreng is noodles. It’s fried noodles, Mi and goreng. Mi is noodles and goreng is fry, yeah.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so Mi Goreng and Nasi Goreng.

  Oh, I think we call it Satay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:

  Yeah, Satay.

  Yeah, Satay.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and that’s mainly chicken on a stick right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ivan:
  </strong>
  Chicken, you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   go for
  </span>
  chicken, you can go for meat, you can go for mutton, anything, liver, anything. And we usually have some kind of special sauce, or ketchup or whatever, like mixed with some
  <span class="audionotes">
   weird stuff
  </span>
  but…
  <span class="audionotes">
   basically
  </span>
  it’s ketchup, chili, and salt and some ginger or whatever. Sometimes it’s garlic and you just dip it inside and you eat it and it’s really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh that
  <span class="audionotes">
   sounds really good
