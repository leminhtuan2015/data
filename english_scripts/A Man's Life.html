  Katia:
 </strong>
 Hello, everyone, this is Katia from Mexico and we are here with Paul from England, and today we&#39;re gonna have a very interesting conversation about men. What&#39;s difficult about being a man and what are the good things about being a man, so we have the right candidate for this. Paul, what are the bad things about being a man?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s difficult about being a man? Well, I think... the hardest thing I think is working. The man is
  <span class="audionotes">
   under a lot of pressure
  </span>
  to go to work and to earn money for the family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  But I thought men like to work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Yeah, men do like to work of course. Like most men want to have a career but along with the work, there&#39;s a lot of pressure. They have pressure from their wife, from their kids, from their family, from the bank manager.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess so. That can be stressful. What else? What else are one of the bad thing of being a man?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Well, I guess, if a man&#39;s... has a good job or a job that&#39;s taking up a lot of his time, this can sometimes
  <span class="audionotes">
   lead to problems
  </span>
  with his relationship, especially with his his kids, I think. For example, if the kids are spending a lot of time with their mother, usually they
  <span class="audionotes">
   form a closer relationship
  </span>
  with their mom, so the father, I think,
  <span class="audionotes">
   misses out on
  </span>
  his kids growing up sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that is true and now I can that clearly unfortunately it seems that it&#39;s a lot of bad things with the job, but I am sure they&#39;re very good things about being a man.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  For sure, there are a lot of advantages I think. For example, appearance. I think, for a man, he doesn&#39;t really... when he&#39;s not working, he doesn&#39;t really need to worry about his appearance. He can wear whatever clothes he wants to wear. He doesn&#39;t brush is hair or he can wear
  <span class="audionotes">
   scruffy shoes
  </span>
  for example.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Mmm, are you sure about that one?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Would you disagree? Yeah, I think usually that appearance is not so important for a man.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Possibly.I guess women spend more time in appearances but there must be more things than this about good things about being a man.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Good things? I think men usually can have more fun than women. Like in their free time, they get to play sport and do a lot more fun things I think than women.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Well, Paul, I&#39;m gonna have to disagree with that one, but tell me why. Why do you think men can have more fun than women?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Maybe I&#39;m just thinking from a man&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   point of view
  </span>
  , but to me shopping sounds very boring.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  OK, well, I do agree with that one, but still you haven&#39;t answered my question.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  What was your question again?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Why do you think men can have more fun than women?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Just I think that men have a lot more freedom to do fun things and travel. For example, safety and traveling alone. A man can just go traveling by himself, where a woman, she has to think, where am I going, is it safe. For example, this kind of think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  OK. I can understand a little bit. You were getting a little bit nervous, Paul.
