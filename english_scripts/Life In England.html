   Sarah:
  </strong>
  My name is Sarah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and Sarah where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from the north of England, Newcastle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so Newcastle, how far is that from London?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Um, it&#39;s about 300 miles.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh, do you go to London a lot or have you been to London before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  I live in London. I&#39;ve lived in London for the past seven years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Almost seven years, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Which do you prefer, London or Newcastle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Um, like them both. I prefer Newcastle because it&#39;s smaller, so it&#39;s easier to get around and it&#39;s also cheaper. London is very expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So all your family is in Newcastle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Um, pretty much yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So are they always trying to get you to go back and move back to Newcastle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Ah, no, no, because most of the jobs are in the south, anyway for younger people so it&#39;s quite difficult to get a job in the north in teaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Um, what do you like about London?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Ah, it&#39;s a very busy place, there&#39;s lots of things going on all the time. There&#39;s also lots of things I don&#39;t like about London, but all my friends live there lots of job opportunities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what were you doing before you came to Japan in London?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Ah, I was in Austria for a year. I was teaching in Austria, and then I was in London teaching, in London for a few years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What were you teaching in London?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  I was teaching primary school. I was a primary school teacher.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Kids!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what&#39;s it like teaching kids?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah:
  </strong>
  Um, tiring. Very tiring. I prefer teaching adults. That&#39;s my preference. I&#39;ve mainly taught adults in TEFL, but in the state system in England it&#39;s only been children. It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s just very tiring.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, where did you grow up in England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  So, I grew up in a place called Bradford
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <a href="../../shop/pro-001-400.html">
    <img src="../../shop/thumbs/promo-image-001-150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" class="floatright">
   </a>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Actually Bradford is famous in England for two things. One, it&#39;s famous for curry. Indian curry because in Bradford we have a lot of Indian and muslim people, but also it&#39;s famous for riots because Bradford had major riots in England, it&#39;s had maybe the two worst riots in England for the past 10 years and that&#39;s due to racism basically.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, no! Is it a rough area?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s very working class. Yeah, not so much money in Bradford, pretty poor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What was it like growing up there, like, what did you do as a kid?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  What did I do as a kid? It was, it was tough, I lived on a government, well we call it councilor estate, maybe in America it&#39;s called maybe government assisted housing, so my area was pretty tough, but always there were lots of kids around so we were always playing
  <br>
  football, cricket, or riding bikes or sometimes causing mischief.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How would you cause mischief?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  It depends, maybe sometimes there&#39;s an old guy who nobody likes who lives near us so we go and throw maybe eggs at his windows and as we grew older we started throwing rocks at his windows, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What would you do if you had a house now and some kid threw eggs at your house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  If some kid threw eggs at my house I&#39;d probably buy a big dog and set the dog off the least and the dog can chase the kids away.

   Hello! Can you introduce yourself please.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Sure, my name is Steven Patterson and I&#39;m from a small town called Brentwood in Essex which is in England.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK. Essex. What part of England is that?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s in the southeast.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Southeast.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Yeah, yeah. It&#39;s attached to London, just next to London.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, OK, but you said it&#39;s a small town.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   It&#39;s quite small, well, relatively small. The populations about 50,000.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, well what kind of place is your town where you grew up?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Um, it&#39;s actually a very nice town. People often move into Brentwood from the surrounding towns, or from the east end of London. Um, it&#39;s quite prosperous. Well, you could, in some respects, it&#39;s a dormant town. People often travel out from Brentwood into London and they work in the city, but it&#39;s a pleasant place to live. It has lots of countryside around it. There&#39;s a very large country park. Ah, it&#39;s quite a small town but it&#39;s, at the high street it&#39;s quite small but it&#39;s quite a pleasant town to shop in.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, it sounds nice. Well, now if you live in a little town that&#39;s near London is it really expensive?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Well, Brentwood is particularly expensive just because it&#39;s a desirable place to live and it&#39;s proximity to London also makes it, the housing is quite expensive, even a town next to it would have much cheaper housing.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, really, cause when I think of a small British village, you know, I think of really old houses, and nothing&#39;s changed, so do you have modern stuff, like do you have a health club and a movie theater and things like that?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steven:
   </strong>
   Uh, I think the cinema in Brentwood actually closed down, with the advent of out of town shopping centers they always have their multiplex cinemas with six or eight screens and the cinema in Brentwood only had two screens and it couldn&#39;t really compete for everyone has cars these days so they can easily travel to big shopping centers, so that closed down however, yeah, it have a very nice health center and as I said lots of parks to play. There&#39;s lots of opportunity to exercise and do various forms of recreation.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Wow, sounds like a nice place to live.
