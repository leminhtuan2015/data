   Todd
  </strong>
  : So, Abidemi, let&#39;s talk about languages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidem
  </strong>
  i: Sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You are from Nigeria and Nigeria has many languages, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : How many languages can you speak?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I would say that I can speak one language very well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : And that would be English. But, I speak other languages fairly well. Yoruba, which is a Nigerian language, French, and a little bit of Japanese as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You are Canadian also, and in Canada, students study French, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you speak French often in Canada?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : While I was living there I spoke it a lot more, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you like French?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I love French. I love learning languages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : French, I think, is very hard for some people, myself included, because the pronunciation of some words is very different than the pronunciation of American English. I think it&#39;s funny that there are some words in French that look exactly the same as words in English but we pronounce them completely differently. For example, I will say the word in English, and you say the same word in French. Okay?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I will try.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : For example. Impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : [French 00:01:46].
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right, so that is so interesting. Again, impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : [French 00:01:49].
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And they&#39;re spelled the same, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, how about reservation?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : [French 00:01:56].
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s so cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I have never thought of it like that before, Todd, but you&#39;re right. They look the same but the pronunciations are different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I think it&#39;s a trick because we see the word, and we know how to say it one way, but we have to say it a different way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : We just can&#39;t do that well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So, you can speak Yoruba.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Yoruba, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yoruba. How do you say, &#34;How are you?&#34; In Yoruba.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : [Yoruba 00:02:33].
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s so cool. Again?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : [Yoruba 00:02:35].
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : [Yoruba 00:02:37]?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : [Yoruba 00:02:38].
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh wow. That&#39;s so cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Have you ever taught that language?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : No, never. I don&#39;t think too many people want to learn it outside of Nigeria.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I think, in the future, more people will want to learn unique languages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I hope you&#39;re right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What language do you want to learn in the future?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I have many that, if I had more time, I would like to learn. I&#39;m interested in Japanese, of course. I live in Japan now, so I would like to speak it better. I would also like to learn Mandarin, Russian, Hausa, another Nigerian language, Spanish, and maybe a couple of others.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, there&#39;s so many languages I want to learn. I want to learn Spanish too. I can speak some Thai and Japanese because I lived as a teacher in both countries. But, I want to learn a language that has the same alphabet. I can read Thai but not very well. I can read Japanese but not very well. I want to learn a language where it&#39;s easy to read and see what the word is. In Thai, you can&#39;t do that. In Japanese, you can&#39;t do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I know what you mean. It would make it easier to learn the language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : But in Russian, you can&#39;t do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s completely different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true, but they have alphabets that are the same. You just have to decode them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : A little bit, yeah. We have the phrase, it&#39;s all Greek to me, which means you have no idea. Anyway, thanks a lot, Abidemi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Thank you, Todd.
