  Dai:
 </strong>
 So, Naomi, so you&#39;re from Wales and you&#39;re eleven. So what does an eleven-year-old girl do for fun in Wales?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  I do music. I play the piano and and the violin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  How long have you played the piano for?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  Since I was about eight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Eight. And what about the violin?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  About the same?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  OK, and what kind of level are you at now, then, at the piano?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  I just passed my grade three.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Oh, congratulations. So that&#39;s grade three of ... what is that?
 </p>
 <p>

  Of ... you have different levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  OK. And it starts at grade ...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  One. And it gets harder.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Up till ... what&#39;s the highest grade you can get?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  Eight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Oh, grade eight. So, you&#39;re a grade three now. So I guess the next one you&#39;re gonna do is grade four?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  OK, and so what do you have to do? What kind of test is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>

  </a>
  ? You look at the script and you have to sing the notes or ... ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  No, somebody
  <span class="audionotes">
   plays a tune
  </span>
  for you and you have to sing it, exactly the same tune that they played, and there&#39;s sight reading where you have to look at the page and then play it on the piano.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. Is that hard?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I can imagine. So often ... how much to you practice the piano then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  It probably should be
  <span class="audionotes">
   once
  </span>
  a day, but I normally do it three times a week - about that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  OK. And you enjoy it then?
 </p>

  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  Yeah, is that fun?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>
  Sort of. It&#39;s not as fun as the piano.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>
  OK. And do you do any other things in your
  <span class="audionotes">
   spare time
  </span>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Naomi:
  </strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dai:
  </strong>

 </p>
 <p>
