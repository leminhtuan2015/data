   <br>

    Shuan:
   </strong>

   <br>

    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, and did you only stay at sea or did you make stops on your cruise ship?

   We actually made 4 different stops. I cannot remember the last place but the first place we stopped was Key West. The second place we stopped was Peurta Vearta, and the third place was Cancun, and the last place I just can&#39;t remember the name.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Actually, what about Key West? Is Key West a nice place?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Key West is a really nice place: all the different buildings and stores are actually
   <span class="audionotes">
    constructed
   </span>
   to make, or constructed to look like
   <span class="audionotes">
    historical buildings
   </span>
   . They are all made out of stone and wood.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, I see, so they are supposed to look like the first people that came from Europe that built.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Yeah, they look almost Gothic in style.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Now Key West, is that the U.S. or is that it&#39;s own little
   <span class="audionotes">
    territory
   </span>
   .
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Ah, Key West. I don&#39;t know.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know either and I&#39;m American, so
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   I actually, if I think back, I do believe that everybody drove on the left-hand side of the road, and I think I recall somebody saying that it was part of the U. K.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, really. OK, interesting. So anyway,
   <span class="audionotes">
    besides
   </span>
   the buildings, what&#39;s Key West like? Is it like a good place for adventure, a good place for night life?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   It&#39;s a good place for outdoor sea sports.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, yeah, for example, like what can you do?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Well, to tell the truth I was really
   <span class="audionotes">
    sunburnt
   </span>
   the day I got to Key West because I spent too much time on the cruise ship on the top deck.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh that&#39;s terrible.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   So I had to get in the water and I had to get in quick so the very first day we went to, me and my friend Jason, we just went to beach and swam around for most of the day. We went with snorkels and flippers. We basically just dived down to as deep as we could to avoid the sunlight.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, smart move. Oh, that&#39;s nice. So did you actually do any scuba diving when you were in Key West?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s what I did on the second day, yeah. Jason and I, we really wanted to go and try some scuba diving, although we had to go with an instructor, it was still a really good experience.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So then you go down in the water. What happens? You go down in the water and what do you see and what&#39;s it like being underwater.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   To breathe underwater is one skill that I really wish I had and, but it was magnificent in Key West. We saw all these different kinds of fish. It was just so many colors, and it was just beautiful, the water was just sky blue all the way down and it was just absolutely, yeah, just beautiful.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Are there any dangers when you&#39;re down under the water?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Well, they say that sharks are dangerous. We actually did get shark knives in case any sharks did approach us, but in most cases sharks think that you&#39;re big and they do try to avoid you.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, I got it. But you say you have a shark knife that there&#39;s an actual knife you can stab a shark with?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   It&#39;s a knife that you use to cut yourself free from lines, from ropes. If you need to you can stab a shark with it. Yes, but
