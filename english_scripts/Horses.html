   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hello, Daniela, how are you tonight?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniella:
  </strong>
  Hi, Todd. I&#39;m fine, thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, you were showing me a picture of a horse.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniella:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you were saying that female horses and male horses are different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniella:
  </strong>
  They behave different to me, so maybe it&#39;s just my
  <span class="audiodef">
   imagination
  </span>
  , or not but female horses, mares, are kind of
  <span class="audiodef">
   cold and aggressive
  </span>
  towards me cause I&#39;m a female and I kind of
  <span class="audiodef">
   compete over
  </span>
  the male coaches&#39; affection, that was my conclusion because male horses are so nice to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you saying the horse can tell if it&#39;s a man or woman rider.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniella:
  </strong>
  Exactly, my horse can do that. She&#39;s more
  <span class="audiodef">
   affectionate
  </span>
  towards men.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniella:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and she&#39;s a female.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So if I want to go horse riding for the first time and I&#39;m on my own.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniella:
  </strong>
  You don&#39;t have to worry because the coach will make sure the horse will behave and it will fear the coach, at least, and it won&#39;t do anything wrong to you, but if you want to make friends with the horse you&#39;ll probably have to
  <span class="audiodef">
   work out
  </span>
  more with a male horse.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniella:
  </strong>
  Yeah, for me it&#39;s very difficult to become friendly with a female horse. Maybe it&#39;s just my impression. Maybe it&#39;s not true but that&#39;s my conclusion so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s good to know. Thanks.
