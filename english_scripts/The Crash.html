   We have a lot of great ski areas in Colorado so I started skiing at a very early age. I think I was about 5 or 6 years old when I began and one time I went up the chair lift and on the first run down in the morning I was skiing on a pretty icy section and I got going pretty fast and suddenly I hit a much softer
   <span class="audionotes">
    patch
   </span>
   of snow and it threw me forward and I had a terrible crash and I couldn&#39;t move my leg so my dad asked someone to call the ski patrol and when the ski patrol came down they put me in a sled and the ski patrol skied in front of the sled and took me all the way down to the medical clinic. They have a small clinic with doctors right at the ski area. Although they don&#39;t have the equipment to, to fix my leg.

   and then they gave me
