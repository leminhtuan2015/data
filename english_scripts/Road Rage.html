   Julia
  </strong>
  : So Nathan, I got a ride here with you today and I noticed in the car that you were a little bit angry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : You know that was me toned down.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Oh my goodness.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : I can seriously get mega
  <span class="audionotes">
   road rage
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Where&#39;s it coming from? Where&#39;s it coming from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : I think it&#39;s because I think that everybody should be like aware and considerate of everything around them and I try to be so I try to never go over the speed limit. If I can see like there&#39;s a row of traffic coming on and there&#39;s a car stopping the traffic because they want to turn, I always try to let them turn and I think that some people are selfish and it
  <span class="audionotes">
   drives me bonkers
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : So you have road
  <span class="audionotes">
   compassion
  </span>
  and road rage at the same time?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Yeah, maybe. But it&#39;s interesting because I&#39;m going through a process at the moment of trying to wash away this road rage and actually it comes from your husband. He&#39;s kind of like my yogic master and he&#39;s telling me all these things to help me. He&#39;s, when somebody does something crazy and your husband is in the car with me going to work every day...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Does he give you the voice in their head?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : And he says you know it&#39;s just a mistake. They didn&#39;t normally want to do that kind of thing but just this one time they made a mistake and they probably won&#39;t do it again and it doesn&#39;t matter. Or if I say yeah but lots of people do that and he says but they&#39;re not going to change, you can&#39;t drive their car, you can only...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : He&#39;s infuriating with his wisdom, isn&#39;t he?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Well but it&#39;s useful because it&#39;s me changing, like it&#39;s helping reduce my stress but it&#39;s made me think about some other things as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : So do you think there&#39;s a job out there then for people who become passengers to road ragers and give them this calming voice? They sit there in the passenger seat and as you&#39;re driving along and your road rage
  <span class="audionotes">
   manifests
  </span>
  , this person has then to calm you down and
  <span class="audionotes">
   talk you through it
  </span>
  . Do you think there&#39;s a job there, do you could make money from that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : I reckon five years ago when the economy was pretty good that would have been a possibility but I think that now that maybe people don&#39;t have that money to splash around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : We&#39;re all just stuck with our road rage then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Stuck with my road rage.
