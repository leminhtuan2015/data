 Hey, Linds.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Hi, Chris. How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Pretty good. Hey, I heard you&#39;re getting married?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  I am. I got
  <span class="audionotes">
   engaged
  </span>
  in July and I&#39;m getting married next September.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Wow. That&#39;s quite a long time between getting engaged and getting married.

   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  It is but in America you usually have an engagement for one year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Why is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know, but now it&#39;s very regular to have a long engagement so if I don&#39;t have a long engagement, it seems like it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a rushed wedding
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  So, what do you have to do between now and next September? What do you have to prepare?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Well, I hired the band.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Already?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yes. They&#39;re a funk band.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Brilliant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  They play the Beatles and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Together?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Maybe not together, but I&#39;ve hired a band and they&#39;re great and I&#39;ve also hired the florist, and I&#39;ve hired the caterer so we have the food and everything sorted and I have picked the location.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Well, how long did it take you to decide all that? It seems like you&#39;ve done a lot of preparation already.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  It took me about two months to get everything done. I saw about five different bands and six different florists and I looked at about seven different places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Did the bands actually come to your house? Kind of set up in your living room and play or what?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  No, I would look at the video. Each band had a video, so I previewed by looking at their video, but it was important for me to have a band that was very lively and that had
  <span class="audionotes">
   an MC
  </span>
  , so someone could be in charge of the wedding to say the announcements.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  OK. Well, that sounds good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  And so, are you doing all the preparation or is your fiance helping out?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s pretty much doing nothing so I&#39;m doing everything, so the thing last that we really need to
  <span class="audionotes">
   figure out
  </span>
  is the guest list and then what will the ceremony be like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  OK. So I suppose he&#39;s paying for everything, right? That&#39;s his job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  No, actually, I&#39;m very fortunate
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the fact that
  </span>
  my parents are paying for most of it, and my finance&#39;s parents are paying for some of it as well, so... and I think we&#39;re going to have about a hundred people so it should be maybe kind of expensive, but...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s pretty big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but I&#39;m gonna get a lot of presents so I&#39;m very excited.
