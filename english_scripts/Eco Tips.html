   Rachel:
  </strong>
  You were talking about Earth Hour and that&#39;s switching the lights off is one way to save electricity and protect the environment. What other things do you do in your life to save for example water?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, as for me, I recycle all my waste. I also, as for water, before brushing teeth, I have a cup. I just fill the cup and then use it. I don&#39;t know if you do it. Do you do it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Actually,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I have to confess
  </span>
  , I don&#39;t save water very efficiently. I usually
  <span class="audionotes">
   leave the tap running
  </span>
  when I&#39;m brushing my teeth, so I will try.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do you have any other tips for saving water?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, start off buying a cup before you brush your teeth, and of course, try to close the tap. When you&#39;re trying to like throw trash or something, try to separate your trash, and of course turn off any electricity that you&#39;re not using. Unplug them because even if you don&#39;t use it, and you have a plug, it will use electricity.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Thank you. So do you always unplug your laptop computer when you go to sleep or do you sometimes leave it running?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  I actually plug my laptop. I will charge it fully and then I will unplug it and use it -- all the battery, so I guess I do, and especially I don&#39;t use my laptop. For my laptop I just use it for class, so pretty much yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  Well, my computers very old, and I&#39;m always scared if I turn it off that it won&#39;t start up again, so I
  <span class="audionotes">
   leave mine on
  </span>
  all the time. I think I&#39;m the worst environmentalist. But I do recycle a lot of our trash, and I also have never owned a car, so I take public transport everywhere. Do you have a car?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  I do have a car. However I try not to use it, because if I use it I will just take
  <span class="audionotes">
   the whole family
  </span>
  : my parents and my sisters. And as for shopping, I will just take the public transportation because it&#39;s right almost really near to my house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  In Costa Rica, do you actually need a car to travel between places or is public transport very good?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Compare Costa Rica with other countries, for example the United States or Japan, Costa Rica doesn&#39;t have the railroads. It doesn&#39;t have the subways. But we do have a good bus, transportation, and it&#39;s pretty much really cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  So Steven
  <span class="audionotes">
   you&#39;ve inspired me
  </span>
  to be more environmentally friendly, so I think I&#39;m gonna go and buy a cup so I can brush my teeth and save water.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Great idea. Thank you Rachel.
