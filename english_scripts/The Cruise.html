    Todd:
   </strong>
   Hey, Shuan, it&#39;s good to see you. How was your break?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Ah, it was great Ted. I went to, I went on actually, a Caribbean cruise with my friend Jason.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   No, way, you went on a cruise?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Yeah, it was, it was
   <span class="style4">
    a
   </span>
   <span class="audionotes">
    hectic
   </span>
   <span class="style4">
    cruise
   </span>
   mind you.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, man, I&#39;ve always wanted to go on a cruise. So what&#39;s it like?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Well, I mean, we started out in Florida and that&#39;s when I met up with, well, that&#39;s when my family met up with Jason&#39;s family. Jason&#39;s the name of my friend, and while we were in Florida, in, I can&#39;t remember the name, but we went jet-skiing, and that was really, really fun.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Wait a minute. You were on a cruise and you go jet skiing?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Oh, before we actually went on the cruise boat.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, OK.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Yeah, we were just in the harbor and then we decided to go have some fun so we rented a couple of jet skis, and we went around the harbor.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, that&#39;s cool man. Actually, when you get the jet skis, do you have to take a test of anything? Do they just give them to you?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan
   </strong>
   : Ah, you don&#39;t have to take a test because it was in an
   <span class="style4">
    <span class="audionotes">
     enclosed area
    </span>
   </span>
   pretty much.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, OK.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   They set out an area for learners to use jet skis.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, nice, but from the harbor you got on the cruise ship. What was the cruise ship like?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Oh, it was absolutely
   <span class="style4">
    <span class="audionotes">
     massive
    </span>
   </span>
   . It was about 8 stories high. And the first two stories we just for cabins, I&#39;m sorry the first three stories were for cabins and the next story was all shops and then the story above that, it was night club, a casino, an art exhibit an indoor pool and on the top deck of course was the outdoor pool, bar and another night club, and few more pools, and it was the biggest ship I think I&#39;ve ever seen.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   That sounds awesome.
  </font>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   So how do you spend you time on a cruise ship? Like, what&#39;s a typical day on a cruise ship?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   A typical day, you wake up probably
   <span class="style4">
    <span class="audionotes">
     hung over
    </span>
   </span>
   at around noon  and then you head to the top deck to sunbathe for
  </font>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   a few hours and as soon as you start to get red you
   <span class="style4">
    <span class="audionotes">
     head in
    </span>
   </span>
   , have another few drinks, maybe swim in the pool for a bit, head down to the arcade room, play a few games and head to the pizzeria, have some lunch, late lunch, and then it would be back outside on the deck and play some deck games.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So on the ship did you see any shows or anything?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Yes, that&#39;s actually one of the biggest rooms on the ship is the theatre room. It&#39;s about two stories high. We say magic shows. We saw even a play, oh and also stand up comedy which was pretty good.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, man that&#39;s great. Well, so how much did the cruise cost in total?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   I have no idea. I got my parents to pay for that.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Man, sounds like a good deal.
