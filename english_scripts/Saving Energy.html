   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So, you are pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   in tune with
  </span>
  global warming. You are pretty in tune with the environment - conscious,
  <span class="audionotes">
   environmentally conscious
  </span>
  . What do you do to do your part for help protecting the environment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, I think I do quite a bit. I grew up in an area that&#39;s really environmentally conscious. Oregon is pretty environmentally conscious, so I recycle. It&#39;s pretty easy to recycle in Oregon. They just pick it right up at your house. You don&#39;t have to separate it. They separate it for you, so I recycle as much as I possibly can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  But maybe those are traditional things. Do you do anything sort of more advanced or more modern than just recycling? Is there anything in your life that&#39;s more more modern?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, one thing: I recently bought a
  <span class="audionotes">
   hybrid car
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  A hybrid car.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s a hybrid car?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  So it is a car that basically gets better gas mileage cause what my car does is I have to put gas in it. I have to put gas in it but when I break it takes the energy created by the heat from the breaking and it charges the battery, and then the battery can help power the car, so it&#39;s half gasoline, half - just electric energy from the battery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Really. Electric and gas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Really interesting. So do you have to charge the car at night? Do you have to plug it in or anything like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  No, my car just by breaking it charges the battery completely. Occasionally, I&#39;ve heard of some people that if they leave their car for like a year or something they have to go back and they&#39;ll have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   plug in the battery and it will charge up
  </span>
  , but for the most part I don&#39;t have to do very much at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So that is a fancy watch you&#39;re wearing as well. Is that environmentally friendly at all?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah. This watch actually doesn&#39;t take batteries. It&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   solar powered
  </span>
  and so it just gets energy from the sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Wow. So you pretty environmentally conscious dude.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I try.
