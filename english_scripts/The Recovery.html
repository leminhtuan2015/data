  Fred:
 </strong>
 So, Shibika, we&#39;ve been talking about your accident and how this has changed your life and how you spent almost a month in bed, so how did that month in bed change your daily routine, like, did you
 <span class="audionotes">
  experience any trouble
 </span>
 brushing your teeth at night? Was it hard for you to eat? Was it hard for you to go to the bathroom? What? How was that?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Right.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Every bit of it
  </span>
  . Every bit of it changed because, like you use your hands to do everthing, you know, in your daily routine, from sleeping to eating to everything, so basically, yeah, and it was initially it was really frustrating because for everything, even while getting up from bed, to going to the bathroom as you said, or eating by yourself, I needed help. I needed assistance.

 <p>
  But then I just tried to do it by myself because it&#39;s not like to call my mom, or call somebody for every small pain you know, to help me, so I tried to do it by myself or I used to use my left hand while doing it, so it was interesting, rather and I developed new hobbies because I had to be in bed the whole time so I couldn&#39;t really go out so I started dreading. I picked up reading.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Really, what kind of hobbies?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Yeah, exactly, like reading. I used to read a lot and then I used to play video games a lot. I got really
  <span class="audionotes">
   hooked
  </span>
  after that, so I used to play video games and watch movies and stuff. Activities that did not
  <span class="audionotes">
   require a lot of effort
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  So, on a daily routine, so for, could you eat your food at the same time, like breakfast, lunch, dinner? Could you eat regular food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I could eat
  <span class="audionotes">
   regular food
  </span>
  , but I had to eat it from my left hand. I had to brush my teeth from the other hand, and like anything, I couldn&#39;t really move one hand completely. It was tied to
  <span class="audionotes">
   a sling
  </span>
  that was tied across my neck so, I couldn&#39;t move that hand at all, and if anything required both my hands, like if I had to wash my face or something I had to ask my mom to do it for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  So how long did it take you to heal?
 </p>
 <p>
  Shibika: It took me a month and a half to actually be you know allowed... after a month and a half the plaster was opened and the sling was taken out and then I could actually move the hand. But after that, also the doctor advised me not to pick up any heavy luggage or not to put any strain on the hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  So, still today do you still have any
  <span class="audionotes">
   constraints
  </span>
  from your accident?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Not really constraints, but sometimes, like I can not go to the gym and I can&#39;t exercise the hands, or sometimes I forget that that hand was injured so I can&#39;t really put a lot of weight on that hand still.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m really glad that you&#39;re healthier now and that you can start living your life normally.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Thank you, Fred. Thank you, so much.
