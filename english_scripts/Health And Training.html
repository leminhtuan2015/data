   Clare:
  </strong>
  So did you have a choice about what sort of job you were going to have in the military?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  No we don&#39;t. Once you enlist you have to go through a ... what do you call ... a health
  <span class="audionotes">
   medical
  </span>
  check up and you&#39;ll be given grade A to F. If you get an F you don&#39;t have to serve in the military. And grade A and B you have to, and for grade I think C you have to but you&#39;ll be given a
  <span class="audionotes">
   clerical
  </span>
  job mostly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clare:
  </strong>
  Is there ... can you say how exactly the classification works or is it just the medical people who decide this?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  For example, for a grade C personnel you might have things like a ... what do you call a &#34;ligament laxity&#34; which means it is easy for you to get
  <span class="audionotes">
   sprains
  </span>
  , ankle sprains or back injuries or stuff like that. And you might have in the past, if you have sweaty palms, that might pass you as grade C because you can&#39;t through a grenade but now they don&#39;t take that excuse anymore. Another thing is if you&#39;re ... if you have a history of asthma attacks ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clare:
  </strong>
  Well I can see why they would not want people who have asthma being a soldier ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Right, but if you&#39;re obese, that doesn&#39;t qualify you for grade C because if you&#39;re overweight what they make you to do is spend an extra two months for Basic Military Training
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clare:
  </strong>
  Ouch..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  ... or what we term as BMT, so for the average Private, or actually recruit, you have to do three months for BMT ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clare:
  </strong>
  Ouch ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  ... but for obese
  <span class="audionotes">
   personnel
  </span>
  you have to do up to five months ... so the extra two months is a lot of training, especially cardio training.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clare:
  </strong>
  Do you know anyone who had to go through five months of BMT?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Both of my cousins ... and quite a lot of my friends actually, because Singaporean diet is actually ... yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;ll just leave it as that
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clare:
  </strong>
  So I imagine if many Americans had to go through that training program, I know I probably would have to take the five months.
