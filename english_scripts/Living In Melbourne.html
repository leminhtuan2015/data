   Josh
  </strong>
  : Hey, Shirley. You’re from Australia, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that’s right. From
  <span class="audionotes">
   Down Under
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay. Are you from Sydney?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : No. I’m not from Sydney. Actually, I’m from Melbourne.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Melbourne?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay. So are there any nice parts in Melbourne?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Well, you know Josh, Melbourne is a great city. And one of the reasons is because there are lots of parks. There’s a really big park right in the center of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Is it beautiful?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : It’s
  <span class="audionotes">
   gorgeous
  </span>
  . It’s called the Botanical Gardens. And they have plants from many different places around the world. And there’s a lake, a small lake in the center. But what I really love about that park is at one time of the year, they have lots of big
  <span class="audionotes">
   fruit bats
  </span>
  that fly into the park and they hang
  <span class="audionotes">
   upside down
  </span>
  from the trees. They are really huge, like big sacks. It’s very cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : That sounds beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : So is there good shopping in your city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Oh, there’s great shopping in Melbourne. You know, Melbourne has people from many different countries. So we have a great variety of things; and clothing, cars, coffee shops, foods from many different countries. So it’s a great place to shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Wonderful. What about housing? Is there cheap housing or is it really expensive?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Well, it’s not cheap but it’s not as expensive as Sydney. Sydney is the biggest city in Australia. It’s very expensive to live. But in Melbourne, hmm, the housing is so-so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : How do you get around in Melbourne? Do you take the bus?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : You can take the bus but Melbourne has something very special that no other city in Australia has. We have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   tram
  </span>
  system. I think they’re called trolley cars in America, maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that sounds familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Well, Melbourne has a really big tram system so you can go lots of places in the city by tram. It’s really good fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : What about the tram? Is it expensive?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Not so expensive; cheaper than the bus. Maybe about the same as the train. Cheaper than a car. Probably, one of the cheapest ways to travel in the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : What about schools in Melbourne. Is there a big university?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Melbourne has three or four really big universities and some smaller universities, too. Also, they have some very good
  <span class="audionotes">
   private
  </span>
  high schools and some very good
  <span class="audionotes">
   public
  </span>
  high schools.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Great. That sounds like a great place to go to school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : It’s a pretty great place to live.
