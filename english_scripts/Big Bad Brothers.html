   So, greg you were saying you had brothers and
   <span class="style4">
    they always
   </span>
   <span class="audionotes">
    picked on
   </span>
   <span class="style4">
    you
   </span>
   like all older brothers do. Do you have any stories about your brothers used to do to you?

   <strong>
    Greg:
   </strong>
   Ah, yes, you know I think back on some of the
   <span class="style4">
    crazy fights
   </span>
   we had and it is absolutely amazing that we are all still alive. (Yeah) One time, I was closing the garage door and I didn&#39;t see my brother, my oldest brother walking behind me and I pulled the door down and it hit him in the head.

    Greg:
   </strong>
   <span class="audionotes">
    A complete accident
   </span>
   . (Yeah) but he just got so angry.  He had a pair of shoes that he was holding in his hand, and I think he was going to polish them or something, and he just took the shoe and
   <span class="style4">
    he
   </span>
   <span class="audionotes">
    smacked
   </span>
   <span class="style4">
    me

   as hard as he could right in the stomach.

    Greg:

   Oh, it hurt so much. I bent over and I got so angry and I looked in the garage and I saw a big piece of metal pipe

    Todd:

   Oh, no!

    Greg:
   </strong>
   And I held it like
   <span class="style4">
    <span class="audionotes">
     a spear
    </span>
   </span>
   , and I ran after him, and he of course ran away. I was chasing him around the house and he ran into the front door, and I threw the spear, as hard as I could, and it went like a, I threw the pipe, and it went like a spear, through the air, and he closed the door right behind him, and it put a hole in the door.
