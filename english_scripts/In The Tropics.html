   Aimee
  </strong>
  : So Paul, what’s most
                      memorable job experience that you have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Hmm, well, I think the
                      most memorable one is the volunteering time that I
                      spent in Australia. And I was up in the
                      northeastern corner where there’s a relatively
                      small rainforests. And I was helping with a
                      research station that’s located in the rainforest.
                      So we do a range of different things, going from
                      trying to control coconuts—coconut trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <img src="../../Assets/pop/POP-1301/1349-tree.jpg" alt="" class="floatright" width="200" height="266">
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Control?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah, because, like,
                      believe it or not, you imagine this kind of
                      tropical paradises to have coconut trees but
                      they’re actually very
  <span class="audionotes">
   invasive
  </span>
  and they’re not native to that area. And
                      basically, if you let a population of coconut
                      trees to go
  <span class="audionotes">
   out of
                        control
  </span>
  , nothing else can grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  They drop their fronds, and they drop, obviously
                      the coconuts, and nothing else can grow. So you
                      basically lose a lot of the
  <span class="audionotes">
   native
  </span>
  species there.
                      So we’re trying to keep them
  <span class="audionotes">
   under control
  </span>
  . There
                      was also caring for bats that had been orphaned.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Sometimes they’re born with physical
                      disabilities that mean they can’t survive in the
                      wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   sanctuary
  </span>
  then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yes. Just like a
                      sanctuary, yeah. So they take care of—
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : What size of bats, like
                      any other—
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Fruit bats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : What size are they?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : They’re pretty, like, once
                      they spread—they’re like little monkeys with big
                      wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So what’s their
                      wing span then?About?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Let’s say, maybe, I guess
                      up to probably 4 feet. Does that sound too much?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : So about a meter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Some of the big
                      dudes, they got huge
  <span class="audionotes">
   wingspan
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh, the only bats I’ve
                      seen in real life are really tiny. They’re just
                      like mice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Oh, the micro-bats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : They’re like little
                      birds, you know. You see them flying around and
                      you think, “Oh that’s birds.” No, they’re bats. So
                      these guys sound pretty big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Hmm, but they’re
                      completely like omnivorous. They only eat fruit,
                      so like, they really—
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Do they eat the coconuts?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Well, the coconuts are
                      kind of tough for them to get into. You need to be
                      able to make a hole, I suppose, to get that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Of course, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : But they eat all, mostly
                      like fleshy fruits; apples or whatever they can
                      get really—berries. They’re really important for
                      spreading—because obviously they eat the flesh of
                      the fruit but they don’t eat the seeds. So they
                      just kind of pass through them and they’re really
                      useful for dispersing seeds. So rainforest
                      regeneration, they’re very important animals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : So they’re like the big
                      bumble bees of the rainforest, then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I guess you could
                      look at it like that, yeah. So yeah, that was an
                      interesting volunteering kind of odd job that I
                      had, I suppose.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Essentially yet
                      really cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : I really like to go back
                      there someday.
