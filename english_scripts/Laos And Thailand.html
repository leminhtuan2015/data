   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you went to Thailand, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yep, I spent some time in Thailand. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t see very much of it. I saw Bangkok and Ko Samet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Those are, Ko Samet is a nice place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Ko Samet is really nice. Good swimming.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did you go to any countries around Thailand?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we spent 2 weeks in Lao and I really, really enjoyed Lao. Lao is a very poor country. There&#39;s not much industry, a lot of it&#39;s still mining, fishing, on the Mekong you still see women panning for gold, but my favorite place in Lao is a place called Luang Prabang, and it&#39;s, we really didn&#39;t do very much. There&#39;s lots of things to do. You can go to caves. You can take inner tubes and go down the river, basically we just ate. The food is really good, a lot of French cuisine, the Lao cuisine is good as well, but we just hung around, read books, and enjoyed our days because it was really, really hot, and really, really dry. This was in February.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, I&#39;ve been to Luang Prabang and I remember joggin along the river and, just right outside the city and we would jog for miles and miles, on this little trail. It was just beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah, it&#39;s nice. I really like Luang Prabang. We went to Vietienne as well. It&#39;s not so much, it&#39;s not as cultural as say Luang Prabang is, but a lot of people like to go there to relax, hang out. That&#39;s where a lot of people take the tubes and go down the river so, but once again it was so hot we didn&#39;t really do any of that either.
