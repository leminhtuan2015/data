  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Anita, have you been to San Francisco?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I have been there once a long time ago when I... well, not that long but when I was twelve years old I went there with my family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Great. You know, I&#39;m from San Francisco so what did you think?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I think it was a very beautiful city. You had... there&#39;s so many nice houses in these little
  <span class="audionotes">
   winding streets
  </span>
  , you know, going up the hills and down the hills, and you get the old, the historical
  <span class="audionotes">
   trams
  </span>
  .

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The cable cars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  The cable cars, and the Golden Gate Bridge is beautiful of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually I think the Bridge is still
  <span class="audionotes">
   pretty amazing
  </span>
  . I mean, even people that live there, it&#39;s just an amazing thing to look at, to cross. It&#39;s nice. But one thing about my city is it&#39;s really expensive. Did you
  <span class="audionotes">
   find
  </span>
  it expensive when you were there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Well, thankfully I went there as a child so my parents paid for everything, so I didn&#39;t have to worry about that so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  If I went there now, I mean, probably I would be worried about that, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think... I&#39;m sorry. I forgot. You said you were twelve.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, OK. Well, when you were in America did you enjoy American food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I like any kind of food, so... I don&#39;t like to eat too much fast food but I didn&#39;t have any problems now that I recall, now that I remember so... It was OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Yeah, but in America we don&#39;t eat that much fast food, at least not in San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  OK, I&#39;ll take your word for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did you talk to anybody, or did you meet people?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  In San Francisco, not that I remember. Of course, we talked to people we met but we didn&#39;t visit friends. We just went there as tourists and you know, took
  <span class="audionotes">
   a couple of
  </span>
  tours, so yeah we talked the tour guide who lives there, and it was nice meeting somebody from San Francisco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, my favorite part of the city is... there&#39;s two places actually: Golden Gate Park and also the Presidio. The Presidio is also a park. Did you go to either of those?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I think we did. I don&#39;t remember them very clearly but all the major sites that are there we definitely went to. It&#39;s hard to miss.
