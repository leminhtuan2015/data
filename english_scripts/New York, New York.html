 Hey, Mari.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Hey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  So, I told you about Florida. How about you tell me something about New York?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  New York, yeah. I was born in New York, and I lived there for a little bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   over half of my life
  </span>
  . There&#39;s lots to do in New York.

  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  So, what part are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I was born in New York City and then I grew up in
  <span class="audionotes">
   the suburbs
  </span>
  about 40 minutes north of New York City.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  So, what did you do growing up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  When I was very young I used to go to museums with my parents or go to
  <span class="audionotes">
   Broadway shows
  </span>
  , and go shopping as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  So, you like the city life?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I do like the city life. It&#39;s very convenient. It&#39;s energetic. There&#39;s lots to do, and New York City is
  <span class="audionotes">
   really diverse
  </span>
  so it&#39;s fun to see the different communities and different people and tourists walking around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  So if I was visiting New York, what should I do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  It depends on which season went to visit, so I don&#39;t know if you went during the spring or summer time, I would suggest that you spend some time in Central Park. Go see sports. A lot of sporting events during the summer and there are a lot of events also in Central Park. There&#39;s outdoor theater and music concerts and stuff but if you went maybe in the wintertime, you should go see all the windows on
  <span class="audionotes">
   Fifth Avenue
  </span>
  that are decorated with very holiday themed decorations and Rockefeller Center is know for their big Christmas tree, and you just get a really fun feeling in New York City. Everyone&#39;s a little bit more nicer, and I don&#39;t know, I like all the seasons in New York City so it depends on which season you decide to visit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Ah, sounds great, so there&#39;s a lot of things to do in New York.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
