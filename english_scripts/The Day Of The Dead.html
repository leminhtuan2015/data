  Daniel
 </strong>
 : Hi Olga, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Fine, Daniel, how are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Good, thanks. I wanted to ask you something. I&#39;m really interested about Mexican holidays.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : What?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Can you tell me something about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Sure but what do you want to know? I mean why are you interested in Mexican holidays?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : What kind of holidays you have, what do you do in those holidays?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Well my favorite holiday is the DÃŒa de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : What is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : What do you think about when you hear Day of the Dead?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s a bit scary, isn&#39;t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Olga: Yeah, kind of but actually for us Mexicans it&#39;s not really scary. We&#39;re so used to it. Actually that day we celebrate the, not celebrate but remember the people who are already dead especially in our close family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : We put an
  <span class="audionotes">
   altar
  </span>
  for them which is like a big table decorated with flowers, bread, coffee or whatever the person that is dead used to like and we think that on that day that person is going to
  <span class="audionotes">
   come back from the dead
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah and visit us and maybe eat the food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s on November first, the second too. The second, the altar is still there and after that we just take everything off and go on with our lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : You keep the altar only on the first and the second?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK and do you do it just for your family or do you go and visit friends or other relatives?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : No, we only keep it within the family actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Well sometimes we do it at school but still it&#39;s just like you know to
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep the tradition
  </span>
  but usually in the family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Well another holiday I can think about is Easter. You have Easter too in Chile?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yes, we do have Easter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Easter we actually don&#39;t keep it traditional any more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : What do you mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : You know traditionally we make plays where we
  <span class="audionotes">
   represent
  </span>
  Jesus and the moment when he died and everything right? But you know we don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   reflect
  </span>
  about it any more. We just go on vacations to the beach and celebrate and you know go to concerts and stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Just as Chilean people do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : I guess it&#39;s kind of a trend now right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yeah. We don&#39;t really think a lot about Easter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Olga
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
