  Todd

 : Hey, Edwin, how you doing?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m good thank. How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, I&#39;m doing pretty good. So, did you do anything this weekend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Yes, I went down to the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, you went to the city? Who did you go with?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : I went with a couple of friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, yeah. Were you guys going clubbing and going out?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : No, we just went shopping.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Shopping, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Oh, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  :
  <span class="audionotes">
   You don&#39;t strike me
  </span>
  as the shopping type.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : No, but it&#39;s getting cold now, and I need some winter clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That is true. That is true. So, what did you buy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : I bought a jacket and a pair of warm trousers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : How much did you spend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : I spent about a
  <span class="audionotes">
   couple of hundred
  </span>
  dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow! That&#39;s a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Yes, but I don&#39;t want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   freeze
  </span>
  , so ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. So did you go on Saturday or Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : I went on Saturday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Saturday. You didn&#39;t stay overnight?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : No, I didn&#39;t stay overnight. It was going to be too expensive if we stayed overnight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right, yeah. How did you get there by the way? Do you drive?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : No, we took the bus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, you took the bus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I hate the bus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Yes, but unfortunately I don&#39;t have a license so we have to take the bus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right, actually, I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the same boat
  </span>
  , you know, I don&#39;t have a license either, but when I go to the city I always take the train. Have you ever taken the train?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Ah, no, I have taken the train yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, man
  <span class="audionotes">
   you gotta
  </span>
  take the train.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : How does it compare to the bus?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s so much better ... well, it takes about the same amount of time
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It takes about two hours, but you can kind of walk around a bit, you know, it&#39;s not as cramped. I kind of get motion sickness on the bus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : But isn&#39;t it more expensive on the train?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, actually, you can get four tickets for a hundred dollars, so it&#39;s about twenty-five dollars one way, and I think the bus is ... you can get four tickets for eighty dollars, so it&#39;s only a little more expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : I see, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It does take a little bit longer though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So anyway, what about Sunday? What did you do yesterday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Yesterday? Just walked around campus, and not much to do on Sunday. Sunday is usually my easy-going day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, did you study?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Yeah, later in the night. Daytime it&#39;s usually ... yeah, usually no studies during the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, did you wait
  <span class="audionotes">
   until the last minute
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;m that kind of person, so yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, me too, me too.
