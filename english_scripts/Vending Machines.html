   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, hello, Hisa!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Hi, Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How are you doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Fine thanks, and you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m doing pretty good. Hisa, you were telling me that you have a
  <span class="audiodef">
   concern
  </span>
  about Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And what is your concern?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s
  <span class="audiodef">
   vending machines
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Vending machines
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Can you talk a little about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Yes, as you already noticed, how many vending machines do you come across a day if you are on the street?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Many, many.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  I really do not think we need that many and then each one is really
  <span class="audiodef">
   consuming energy
  </span>
  , so that is my big concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so what would you like to see happen in Japan with the vending machines?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Sorry, what? where?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like, what would you like to happen with the vending machines?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Would you like more laws or..?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Number 1, it really
  <span class="audiodef">
   aggravates
  </span>
  the scenery. Yes, and then if each one of us take drink with us, we really don&#39;t need that many, each corner, or even one corner you really see so many kinds. And then that is, we can really evacuate so many and then we will have a safer, more space on the road, because even without vending machines, imagine how narrow our roads in Japan, even the walking path so narrow, it&#39;s dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you were saying that you can actually can see vending machines in very strange places in Japan, like very, very far places in the countryside?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  So, just one example is on the
  <span class="audiodef">
   summit
  </span>
  of Mt. Fuji. Yes, it&#39;s a shame.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  All the way on the top of Mt. Fuji?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  Yes. So those mountain climbers are talking that don&#39;t make our mountains like Mt. Fuji. In other words, they are not to put another vending machine on the top of other mountains, because why we need it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hisa:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s ridiculous.
