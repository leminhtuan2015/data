  Nathan
 </strong>
 : So we&#39;re talking about gyms and exercises and stuff, Jules, and I want to ask you a question. It may be a bit of advice.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jules
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : You know Madonna?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jules
  </strong>
  : Not personally but.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Right. Well, I heard that Madonna had like started this
  <span class="audionotes">
   craze
  </span>
  where people do gym, they do yoga in hot rooms and the benefit is that because your muscles are all warm, you can do much longer like stretches. You can stretch much further but the
  <span class="audionotes">
   counter-argument
  </span>
  is that you get dehydrated and you might damage yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jules
  </strong>
  : Yeah. To be honest, I don&#39;t know so much about it. Madonna certainly didn&#39;t start it. It&#39;s called bikram yoga.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : OK:
 </p>
 <p>
  Jules: And it originates I think in India but they, I think the
  <span class="audionotes">
   underlying idea
  </span>
  is that because yoga originates in India that we should practice yoga in the same climactic conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jules
  </strong>
  : Therefore you should be stretching and working out in the hot humid thirty five plus. And of course your body is much more flexible when it&#39;s warm and you get a lot, I&#39;ve never done it actually because I, when I go, I can go in a sauna but only for a couple of minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jules
  </strong>
  : Because I start to feel my heart beat and I get dizzy and stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jules
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t like it so the thought of working out in that kind of climate would kind of scares me a little bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : Mmm, maybe I don&#39;t need to try that then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jules
  </strong>
  : But I think you&#39;d benefit from yoga. Everybody benefits from yoga especially someone with your back issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan:
  </strong>
  My poor back, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jules
  </strong>
  : Your
  <span class="audionotes">
   weight training
  </span>
  , was that on your doctor&#39;s advice or are you just trying to strengthen up so that you can protect your body?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : I have a physio and they advised me that one of the problems I have with my back is that the muscles get tired and there&#39;s like a vicious circle. So if you get tired muscles, they go hard and as they&#39;re hard they get, what would I say tense and as they get tense they get more tired more easily so you&#39;ve got like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   vicious circle
  </span>
  . They&#39;re tense so they get tired and as they&#39;re tired they get more tense.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jules
  </strong>
  : Tired, OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nathan
  </strong>
  : And one of the reasons they get tired is because they&#39;re not strong and you
  <span class="audionotes">
   overdo
  </span>
  the activity. So like if you run a marathon, you know the next day your legs are really tired and they really hurt. It&#39;s the same kind of principle that if you do the same position like using a computer for a long time, the small controlling muscles get tired so if you can strengthen them, you can sit at the computer without getting tired for as long.
