  OK, the newspapers in England, well, we&#39;ve got quite a lot of newspapers, some of the more serious ones like The Times. Then you got the
  <span class="audiodef">
   middle of the range
  </span>
  , things like the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, and then you got the British tabloids, which were quite famous for, and the tabloids are quite interesting. Basically, the tabloids are just
  <span class="audiodef">
   gossip
  </span>
  , and they will report
  <span class="audiodef">
   anything and everything
  </span>
  in great detail. Um, a lot of people kind of
  <span class="audiodef">
   disapprove
  </span>
  of the tabloids but personally I find them quite interesting and entertaining. In our house, we have a tabloid newspaper, The Daily Mirror and we have the Daily Mail as well. And in the Mirror you&#39;ll get all the gossip, and things like
  <span class="audiodef">
   horoscopes
  </span>
  , and real celebrity news like recently you&#39;ve had the David Beckham thing that he&#39;s been having an affair, and that was interesting. It went into real detail all the text messages that they sent and everything, uh, and it is kind of, it is just gossip, but then many people get the tabloids because it reports the sport in a lot of detail, so a lot of men get the, for the football scores and horse racing and everything.
