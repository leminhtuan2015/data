  : When I was in Thailand I had experiences with bribery, and we don&#39;t really have it with government officials in the U.S., but I have to admit I thought it was really convenient, because let&#39;s say you are driving and you get a speeding ticket, or you do something wrong, in Thailand you would just pay ten dollars, twenty dollars and the whole incident was forgot. In my culture were
  <span class="audionotes">
   brought up
  </span>
  to think that that&#39;s really bad but I have to admit, I liked the fact that you would pay a little money, and then it was not
  <span class="audionotes">
   on your record
  </span>
  , because in the United States if you get a speeding ticket, or you do anything wrong then it&#39;s on your record, and it&#39;s permanent and that can affect your insurance payment and things like that, so it was this really weird feeling where I felt odd doing it, and I felt awkward doing it because it wasn&#39;t part of our culture, but at the same time I thought it was almost convenient. Have you ever had experiences like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiman
  </strong>
  : Well, I have two different experiences. Because in Syria it is pretty different to Dubai, so in Syria for example, you&#39;d have to bribe the police officers even if you didn&#39;t do anything because that&#39;s how they live. But in Dubai they get really nice wages and they don&#39;t need your bribe. For example, once I was eating dates while I was driving. I was speaking on my phone, my mobile phone, and I was not wearing my seat belt, and I was not paying attention, and then the policeman asked me to
  <span class="audionotes">
   pull over
  </span>
  , and when I did, I didn&#39;t even know what was the problem, so when he came to me and said to me, &#34;Can I have the car registration and license?&#34; I said, &#34;Yeah, sure. Please take one date, or a date, while I look for them.&#34; And he said, &#34;No, sorry, I can&#39;t.&#34; And I was so upset with that. I said, &#34;What do you mean you can&#39;t? Are you better than me? Is that what you&#39;re trying to say?&#34; And he said, &#34;No, It&#39;s illegal. I can&#39;t. You know what, just go. I don&#39;t need anything from you. Please go.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So the policeman in Dubai was very
  <span class="audionotes">
   straight
  </span>
  and honest. He can&#39;t except anything from a driver, and so he turned you down.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiman
  </strong>
  : Exactly. Because he
  <span class="audionotes">
   turned me down
  </span>
  , it is really bad in the Arab culture. He decided to just let me go. Please just go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Really, so if somebody offers you something in an Arab culture, and you decline that&#39;s not polite.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiman
  </strong>
  : Not polite at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, that&#39;s very good to know.
