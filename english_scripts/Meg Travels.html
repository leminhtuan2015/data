   Todd
  </strong>
  : Hey, Meg. We are talking about traveling and visiting other countries. What countries have you traveled to?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ve been to quite a few different countries, for example, Spain, Belize and Indonesia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow, three different
  <span class="audionotes">
   continents
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, pretty far apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow, that&#39;s cool. So Spain, that must be a really nice country. What did you think of Spain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Spain is really beautiful. There&#39;s a lot of beautiful nature and also some nice cities. While I was there, I lived in a small city called Caceres.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh nice. Are the people really friendly in Spain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes. Actually, the people are very friendly and very helpful, especially if you&#39;re lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s great. I hear Spanish food is really, really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Spanish food is delicious. I lived with a Spanish family and my Spanish mom cooked delicious meals every day for lunch. In Spain, seafood is really popular, so I ate a lot of fish and shrimp.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, I love fish and
  <span class="audionotes">
   shrimp
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Now, Spain is really warm, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes. Spain was very hot while I was there during the summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah? How hot? How hot does it get?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It got up past 40 Degrees
  <span class="audionotes">
   Celsius
  </span>
  during the summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It was pretty hot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Does it rain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It does rain. But when I was there in the summer, it didn&#39;t rain very often.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So what about Belize? Belize is a really small country.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Belize is very small, but it&#39;s also hot similar to Spain in the summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Why did you go to Belize?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I went to Belize on a study trip for school, and I stayed there for about two weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Now, does Belize have good food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Belize also has good food. There was a family that cooked for us, and we had a lot of delicious almost Mexican type food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh really? So for example, what do you eat? Like, what do people eat in Belize?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : People eat – it&#39;s kind of like a taco but flat with a tortilla, and some meat and vegetables on top and some spices that make it really delicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So the last country is Indonesia. When did you go to Indonesia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I actually went to Indonesia just last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh wow. How long did you stay?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I only stayed there for about a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah? Oh, short trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it was a short trip, but I was just visiting some friends there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Where did you go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I went to Jakarta and Bali.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, okay. So I hear Bali has really beautiful beaches. Is it true?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it&#39;s true. There are a lot of famous and beautiful beaches in Bali.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, did you surf in Bali?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ve never surfed before. Usually, when I went to the beach, I just wanted to
  <span class="audionotes">
   put my feet in the water
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah. Now, Bali also has  very famous
  <span class="audionotes">
   scenery
  </span>
  on the inside like the rice fields. Did you see the rice fields of Bali?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : No, I didn&#39;t see the rice fields. But I did go to some famous
  <span class="audionotes">
   historical spots
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So of the three countries – Spain, Belize and Indonesia – what country was your favorite?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Maybe Spain was my favorite because I love learning language, and it was really nice to stay with my Spanish family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I could see that. I really want to go to Spain, and I hope to go soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I hope you can go too. It&#39;s beautiful.
