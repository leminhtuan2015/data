  Warren
 </strong>
 : So Lindsay what about your dreams? What did you want to be when you were ten years old?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : When I was ten years old I wasn&#39;t very
  <span class="audionotes">
   realistic
  </span>
  but I knew I wanted to be very powerful so I thought the dream job would be Wonder Woman. She can fly anywhere, she has
  <span class="audionotes">
   the powers to do good
  </span>
  and to help everyone and she&#39;s very bad ass, so I wanted to be just like her. Unfortunately it didn&#39;t come true as I&#39;m not Wonder Woman right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : No, I can see that but it seems like you had a good imagination as a kid. But I guess that probably changed as you got older? What about when you were fifteen?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : When I was fifteen I still wanted to be very powerful and very strong but I had a more realistic idea of what I wanted to be, but I still didn&#39;t know a lot about the world so I just wanted to be a very powerful businesswoman. I had no idea what kind of business and I had no idea what that actually meant but I wanted to wear an all black suit and have a briefcase and go to work in a nice office and drive a nice car and do something that was very powerful but I had no idea really what a powerful businesswoman does.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : That seems like a pretty good dream for a fifteen year old, but I guess you probably had a better idea when you were twenty. So what about then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : When I was twenty then I still wanted to be powerful and strong. I guess you can see the
  <span class="audionotes">
   common theme
  </span>
  here but then I had an even more realistic idea of actual real professions so at that time I was quite social, I really enjoyed going to parties and I was living in New York at the time so I thought the perfect job for me would be a public relations specialist. I thought I could be one of those people that plans parties or handles the PR, the publicity for celebrities. I had a dream of maybe working for Madonna or working for a famous TV show and handling all their publicity representation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s great. It seems like you had a better idea by the time you were twenty. I guess you probably have some dreams now even, so what kind of dreams do you have now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Well then when I was twenty, I was quite
  <span class="audionotes">
   egotistical
  </span>
  . I just wanted, I only thought about myself and how I could have more money and be more powerful but then something changed when I started traveling and seeing the world where I decided that I&#39;d rather have a job that does something good for the world and gives back to the community and to the people. So now I&#39;m a teacher and I really enjoy that and the idea of
  <span class="audionotes">
   making a difference
  </span>
  in people&#39;s lives and in the future maybe when I get older, I hope to start an animal shelter so that when animals are left on the street or abandoned they can come to my shelter and I can provide a happy home for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Warren
  </strong>
  : Wow, that&#39;s a great vision for the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Thanks.
