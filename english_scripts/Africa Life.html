  Todd:
 </strong>
 OK. Leath, you&#39;re from Zimbabwe. Could you talk about that?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leath:
  </strong>
  Yeah, OK. Well, I&#39;m from Harare which is the capital of Zim.  I was born there.

  My folks are British. My dad is from Manchester and my mom is from Scotland. They went out a long time ago. Yeah, growing up in Zimbabwe was &#34;lacker&#34; as we say there. That means really cool in Africans.
 </p>

  <strong>
  </strong>
  It was like you grow up in a big open free place with animals and sunshine and it&#39;s just a really healthy place to be. Well at least it was. Today it&#39;s not doing too well because the
  <span class="audionotes">
   economy has crashed
  </span>
  but growing up there was really
  <span class="audionotes">
   slick
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! What animals could you see?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leath:
  </strong>
  Just about an hours drive out of any city, you are able to
  <span class="audionotes">
   come across
  </span>
  just about anything. I&#39;ve seen leopards often at night about an hour out of the capital where I live. You see monkeys along the road, right up to the
  <span class="audionotes">
   city outskirts
  </span>
  . In certain areas you&#39;ll have to stop for elephants. There&#39;s quite a few buck warning signs because they are actully quite dangerous at night. They jump across the road and your cars hit them at windscreen height. It is a bit of a problem. So, there&#39;s buck everywhere. Away from residential areas, there&#39;s you know your big five, rhino, lion being the most... well interesting and I guess for foreigners. They are never really never around human settlement cause they are very very dangerous. They do take people from
  <span class="audionotes">
   time to time
  </span>
  .

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s fascinating. Thanks a lot Leath.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Leath:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome buddy. OK.
