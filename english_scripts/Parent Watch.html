  Alex
 </strong>
 : So Maria, do your parents use any of the social media sites.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : They do. Both my parents are on Facebook. My mum is not that active on Facebook. She has a profile and she has pictures and I think she&#39;s online whenever she wants to get in touch with her kids mostly, which is me and my sister. But my father he uses it regularly and I sometimes get weird like comments from him. It&#39;s not that bad, but, for example, when I&#39;m traveling and he can&#39;t call me, he just writes like that looks awesome to weird pictures and it kind of gets
  <span class="audionotes">
   awkward
  </span>
  sometimes. But they do have, they are very
  <span class="audionotes">
   active
  </span>
  on the internet and my dad he&#39;s a journalist, so he&#39;s good with words, so whenever we have to write each other, I always get these long mails like that&#39;s very cleverly worded and humorous and it&#39;s so cool. He&#39;s so cool. My mum is more behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : What about Skype?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Skype yes but mostly only to get in touch with me and my sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : OK, cool. What about like do they ever have MySpace?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : No, none of us have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : No, it&#39;s a word I haven&#39;t heard in a while too, MySpace?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : What about Twitter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m not active. My father keeps talking about it. I don&#39;t know if he wants to start a Twitter account because he
  <span class="audionotes">
   keeps mentioning
  </span>
  that it&#39;s kind of a good idea but he&#39;s not there. I&#39;m not because I think I have Facebook that should be enough for me at least. I don&#39;t know if, they are not into social media so they will just like open it for fun. Google Plus is definitely not a solution at the moment because there is Facebook and that&#39;s like a big deal in the first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Have you ever wanted to
  <span class="audionotes">
   de-friend
  </span>
  your parents on Facebook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Nope. I am very open about my Facebook profile. I never wanted to close it to anybody so I try not to, I&#39;m trying to make sure that there won&#39;t be anything embarrassing on it so I manage it so there won&#39;t be any need for like de-friending them and they&#39;re not that annoying. They text me sometimes and they comment my things if it&#39;s something important but they&#39;re being nice. They&#39;re good parents.
