   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Lois, why don&#39;t you have a plum!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Oh, thank you very much. Lovely!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You like plums.?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
  I love all fruits, but plums especially.
 </p>

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, there goes the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s very juicy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It is juicy. How does it taste?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Mm, it tastes sweet, very refreshing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mm, I love plums.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Yeah, me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Guess how much this box cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s probably quite expensive, so in yen, maybe 1,000 yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, yeah, pretty close. It cost 900 yen for 8 plums.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Very expensive in Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I know it&#39;s crazy. In America you can get this for like maybe 200 yen. Not even that, maybe 100 yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  In England it&#39;s cheap but probably not as cheap as in America. I think maybe because we have to import everything. It&#39;s slightly more expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, that&#39;s a good question. What fruits do you grow in England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Apples and Apples and maybe pears and...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No coconuts?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  No coconuts. No bananas. and maybe we grow plums. I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It looks like a very English fruit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  But definitely apples.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Or strawberries?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Strawberries, oh yeah. Lots of strawberries and tomatoes but maybe they&#39;re a vegetable some people say fruit. Some people say vegetable. But lots of tomatoes. And I&#39;m sure lots of other things but, I just know about apples.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s your favorite fruit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  My favorite fruit! I really like pineapples, and I also like strawberries. Strawberries
  <br>
  and cream. It&#39;s one of my favorite desserts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so have you ever been to Wimbleton and had strawberries and cream?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I haven&#39;t. I&#39;d love to go. But strawberries and cream at Wimbleton are so expensive.
  <br>
  I don&#39;t know how much but really, really expensive.
