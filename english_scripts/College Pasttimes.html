   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Alex, you&#39;re still at university.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Yes, sir
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what&#39;s a typical day at university like?

   Alex:
  </strong>
  A typical day at my school, let&#39;s see, well I would usually get up, well last semester, I would get up around 8 or so. My first class would be at 9:10. It&#39;d be an hour so around 10:10 I&#39;d get out of class, you know, have lunch, and I was actually a part of the college radio station
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  So yeah, I&#39;d hang out there, play some music, you know, joke around, play some pool, go to class. It wasn&#39;t too bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, where do you play pool?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Oh, well, anyplace that I can really. There&#39;s a pool table right next to my radio station at school so I usually play a lot there - a place called Mr. Pockets, too, where I live. They&#39;re pretty inexpensive so, I play there too, but I&#39;m not very good. Like the pool table at my college was, it was a bar pool table so you have to pay money for it, 50 cents a game, and I must have put at least a hundred dollars in there and I&#39;m not any better than when I started out, so I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s OK you have other talents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s the allure of pool? Why do college kids like to play pool?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Oh, I have, it&#39;s really a mystery, it&#39;s very ambiguous. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just the pool tables there and something with hitting balls with a stick into little holes, maybe, but it&#39;s a lot of fun. I don&#39;t know why I like it as much as I do
  <strong>
  </strong>
  but even though I&#39;m not so good I like to play some pool.
