   Kara:
  </strong>
  So, you mentioned there&#39;s a large gap between the oldest and you being towards the youngest. What do you think the differences growing up were between your life and their life and what were the advantages and disadvantages?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Well, I think for the most part, it was a great advantage to be one of the younger ones. I&#39;m the second youngest, so having ten, you know, ten siblings, ten older than me definitely helped be growing up because I always had a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   people to look up to
  </span>
  and, you know, telling me right from wrong, which was always a great help. Financially, it was the biggest advantage because, you know, I hear stories from my older siblings about them growing up because they didn&#39;t have a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   resources
  </span>
  and financially my family wasn&#39;t very stable so as they got older, I started working and helping out with, you know, all the expenses. It really helped us little ones to really be, you know, grow up in a better way and have all the things that maybe they didn&#39;t. And also, one of the biggest advantages was that once the older, my older siblings started working, making enough money, you know, they
  <span class="audionotes">
   raised enough money
  </span>
  to move here to the United States, and bring the rest of us here and we had the great advantage of going to school here in the United States and being able to learn another language, educate ourselves, continue to go onto college, which is something that my older siblings didn&#39;t have, so I&#39;m very grateful for that. I think the only disadvantage of being one of the younger ones is a lot of the traditions that were being passed in our family from generations
  <span class="audionotes">
   didn&#39;t quite make it
  </span>
  to us when we moved here to the United States. We weren&#39;t able to do many of the things my older siblings got to do when they lived in Mexico, but you know
  <span class="audionotes">
   I really can&#39;t complain
  </span>
  because we have a lot of other things that they didn&#39;t have when they were little.
