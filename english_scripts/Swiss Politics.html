 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Anja, you are from Switzerland?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, I thought we would talk a little about your country.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  First of all, what do you like most about being Swiss?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Actually, what I like the most about Switzerland is that the country is
  <span class="audionotes">
   neutral
  </span>
  , so that means that we have an army but we don&#39;t have war with any country. We go abroad to support people and help people if there is some sort of war or some trouble abroad, but we don&#39;t fight against any country.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So when there&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a major conflict
  </span>
  , you don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   take a side
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s exactly this.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, how about ,,, are Swiss people very political? Like are they in terms of your country, like are they very
  <span class="audionotes">
   involved with politics
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, actually you have to, especially young people are very involved in politics as well, and like we have votes and what not, like every month there&#39;s something we have to give our vote, and people always do it. It&#39;s really amazing. I like that a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What a minute! You vote every month?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yeah, for some local things or prefectural things and we always get the stuff back home in the mail, and then we have to fill it out. You know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   tick a yes or a no
  </span>
  and bring it to the, how do you say?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like the post office?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes. Then vote.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, it&#39;s like a referendum? It&#39;s about some local issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Yes, exactly. Like referendums or yeah, for the prefecture, for your city or for your village all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty amazing. Now, are these issues that you
  <span class="audionotes">
   take time to look into
  </span>
  , or do you just kind of guess?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anja:
  </strong>
  Well, it depends a little bit, like, if it&#39;s not of very big importance, like of course, everything is important, but then, you know, you just do what you feel is the right thing and you just tick a yes or no, but if you feel like it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a really big deal
  </span>
  , like a lot of money&#39;s being invested or it&#39;s like something that concerns the whole country, then of course you will do like research on it and well, it&#39;s on the news anyway, so you .. they like the government informs you a lot and you get brochures like for the topics and so, yeah. It&#39;s a really big deal.
