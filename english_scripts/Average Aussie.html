  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Rebecca, how would you describe the average Australian? Like if you had to
 <span class="audionotes">
  stereotype
 </span>
 an Australian, what would you say?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I suppose a stereotypical Australian would be in board shorts, thongs,
  <span class="audionotes">
   as in
  </span>
  flip-flops, and outside, having a barbeque drinking a beer I suppose.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  So in Australia, leisure time is very important?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes, it is. Yes. It&#39;s interesting though because we do really look for the leisure time that we have but yet the working... if you have a look at the working rates, they are quite high. The figures are quite high, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah. We do have long working hours. I think that&#39;s more so for people who are in farming and have their own business.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, on average, you know, how many hours do you think an average Australian works a week?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I think the figures are
  <span class="audionotes">
   45 hours plus
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, it can be.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, do Australians usually have a lot of holidays during year? Vacation time?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it definitely depends on
  <span class="audionotes">
   what area your working in
  </span>
  . I get four weeks per year, and then if own your own business, you can take holidays, but you need to work hard to get those holidays.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what are the big vacation times in Australia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  The big vacation times are generally... coincide with school holidays, I suppose because families, so it would be September, because that&#39;s coming into summer and then Christmas is always quite big as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now in the States, we have a phrase, you know, &#34;Work hard, play harder.&#34;
  <span class="audionotes">
   Do you think that would fit Australians?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I suppose it can. Definitely. Yeah, we definitely work hard, but yes, when we do get a chance to go out and play, that is quite hard as well.
