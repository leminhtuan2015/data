    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, that&#39;s a good question. I think it definitely has to be Ewan McGregor.

     primarily

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Probably Moulin Rouge. That&#39;s probably my favorite because in Moulin Rouge he sings a song called Your song by Elton John and he sings it to this girl, and I just think, &#34;Wow, imagine Ewan McGregor singing that song to you. That would just be

   Did you see him in Train Spotting?

   Yes, I did, yeah.

   That&#39;s the first time I saw him and I thought that that was just a really good movie.

   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   It&#39;s a really good film.

    Todd:

   You know when they showed that in the States a lot of people requested that it had like transcripts.

   No way.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, because the English was so difficult for American people to understand.

   Isn&#39;t that funny.

   Yeah.

   Yeah, so, it&#39;s funny though cause now Ewan McGregor is Obi-One.

    Ruth:

   That&#39;s true.

   No, I&#39;m not a Star Wars fan, actually but I would probably watch it just for Ewan McGregor.

   So, Kate, are you into movies?

 </p>
 <p>

   What actors or actresses do you like?

   My favorite actor would be Brad Pitt.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Really, Brad Pitt? Now is that because he’s handsome or because he’s a good actor?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Kate:
   </strong>
   He’s handsome but he’s actually a very good actor. I like him because he is very well respected in Hollywood. You look at the other actors and they’ve all had these scandals: drinking scandals, drug scandals but I haven’t heard of anything about Brad Pitt.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   That’s true actually. Come to think of it, I never have. What’s a movie that he was in that you really liked?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Kate:
   </strong>
   Ocean&#39;s Eleven. That was a very, very good movie.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, any other movies that you really liked?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Kate:
   </strong>
   I can’t think of the names right now, but he has a recent movie out called ‘Mr and Mrs Smith’ I think, and it’s with Angelina Jolie.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   And that&#39;s ... did you hear about that?
  </font>

  </strong>
  No, I haven&#39;t actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Kate:
   </strong>
   They heard….Angelina Jolie is said to have been with Brad Pitt while they were making the movie, although Brad Pitt is supposed to be with Jennifer Anniston.

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

   Right so they’re married, right?

   Yes, they were.

   They were married?

    Kate:
   </strong>
   They separated.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   But they’re not divorced?

   Not divorced, no.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh OK, no I didn’t know that.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   So as a Brad Pitt fan who do you think is more his type? Mrs. Jolie or Mrs. Anniston?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Kate:
   </strong>
   I prefer Jennifer Anniston because she’s more calm and more… they seem like they could have a nice little family together, but Angelina Jolie, she’s very wild and keeps partying and …
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, they do seem like they’re different, that’s true.

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Kate:
   </strong>
   Yeah, very different.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   What is it about Brad Pitt’s features that you think make him attractive?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Kate:
   </strong>
   I like his smile, his eyes. That’s generally what I go for.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So in a guy you look for a nice smile and nice eyes?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Kate:
   </strong>
   Definitely. From first impressions, from the first look, definitely the smile and eyes. If they stand out, I will go for them.
