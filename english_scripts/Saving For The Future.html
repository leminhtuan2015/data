   Sorie
  </strong>
  : So you do have some extra money that you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   put away
  </span>
  , you would say?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : I think maybe everyone has extra money because you just use less. So you just decide in advance to put a little bit aside whether it’s 5 dollars or 50.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : So, like, change your
  <span class="audionotes">
   priorities
  </span>
  and spend less money on other things and more towards your pension?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Exactly. Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Right. So what would you cut? If you had something that you have to stop putting your money towards, what would it be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : I don’t know if there’s anything to cut because I’m not really buying much. I couldn’t
  <span class="audionotes">
   cut
  </span>
  food. That’s primary important. I don’t know. What would you cut?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Clothing, maybe. You know, I’m a woman so I like to wear fashionable clothes so that would be one of them, and traveling. I love traveling, so maybe take one less holiday a year and put that towards my pension.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : One less holiday than one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that’s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Stop going on a holiday. How about have lots of kids? Go back to that idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Well, I actually come from a family with a lot of kids. At the moment, that&#39;s not working well for my parents because I’m not sending any money to them. But maybe in the future. So that’s the thing, you know. It works in
  <span class="audionotes">
   a chain
  </span>
  . I have to worry about my parents, so I cannot really be worrying about my own pension. So it’s like a continuous
  <span class="audionotes">
   burden
  </span>
  that you give to your children. And it
  <span class="audionotes">
   never ends
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Well, yeah, we&#39;re really mixing up with other things. I don’t think we’re really getting an answer though as to what’s best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Well, there are other options as well, you know. You can live a simple life where you can grow food from your land and—
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : And then you wouldn’t need necessarily to save so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, be a healthy person and you don’t have to—take really good care of your body and then you don’t have to go to a place where a nurse has to take care of you at an early age, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : I think that’s what I want to do. I think going for the simple life, trying to create the situation right now to enable like retirement age to spend in such a simple place where everything is taken care of itself and the excess money isn’t necessarily needed. I think that’s what we should do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Awesome.
