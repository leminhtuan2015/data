  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : So John, where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : My hometown is very small. It&#39;s a little town in the countryside, in Wisconsin. There are only 5,000 people there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Wow. There aren&#39;t very many people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : No, it&#39;s very small. There aren&#39;t very many businesses. There isn&#39;t a shopping mall. There are a lot of grocery stores. And there are a lot of gas stations. But there isn&#39;t much to do there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Oh really? Are there any movie theaters?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, there is one movie theater. So that&#39;s a nice thing to do. In fact, there are many screens in the theater. There are eight different movies showing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : How about at night? What&#39;s fun to do â€“ how about at night? Is there very much night life?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Yeah, there is not so much. But there is a bowling alley. It&#39;s fun to go bowling with friends. There&#39;s a bowling alley and the movie theater. There is one restaurant where you can go for tacos and burritos. And there&#39;s one more restaurant for pizza and spaghetti.
 </p>
 <p>
  But during the daytime, you can go to the park. There&#39;s a river that goes through the town. So in the middle of town, there&#39;s a river. And there&#39;s a park that goes along both sides of the river. And at the park, there is a tennis court and a disc golf course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Disc golf?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I like to play disc golf with my friends. It&#39;s really fun. And after we finish playing disc golf, we usually go to the pizza restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Oh, I see. How about schools? Are there very many schools?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Let&#39;s see. No, there aren&#39;t very many. There is only one elementary school, one junior high school and one high school. That&#39;s it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Yeah. There aren&#39;t very many schools but the town doesn&#39;t need more schools because there aren&#39;t very many people there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I see. Are there any mountains?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : No. The whole area is very flat. There are no mountains but there are a lot of trees. In fact, there are trees on my town&#39;s sign because my town is famous for all the trees on every street.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Oh wow. It sounds like a great city.
