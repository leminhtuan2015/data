  Hi, this is Steve. I&#39;m going to talk about Japanese Onsen. Onsen is like a public bath, where men go, or women, in separate areas of course, and enjoy very hot baths.
 </p>
 <p>
  I like it very much because it&#39;s very relaxing and it&#39;s very healthy.
 </p>

  They have different kinds of baths with different sort of flavors, you might say. Some baths have minerals like sulfur, or radium, or even camphor in them and they have different health benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  After bathing in an onsen, for an hour or two you take a shower, shave, and wash your body and then afterwards, you feel really, really good. I like to go for sushi after onsen.

   Akane:
  </strong>
  Hi, Ruth!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Oh, hi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  So, what did you do today?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a good question. Actually, today, I went to the onsen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  Oh, the onsen. What&#39;s an onsen?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  An onsen is a public bath and people go there, basically just to sit in hot water, and it&#39;s, it&#39;s a bit like a spa and it&#39;s really relaxing. You just sit there and don&#39;t do anything really because it&#39;s so warm. It&#39;s really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Well, what did you think about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I really enjoyed myself. I&#39;d never been to an onsen before, so today was my first experience and I am quite British and you have to go in with no clothes on so I was a little bit concerned about that, but it went OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Well, are you going to tell your friends and family that you did that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Um, I think probably I will tell them, and I think they might listen to this actually, so
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  And how do you think they&#39;ll feel about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  They&#39;ll probably think it&#39;s really funny. Yeah, I think they&#39;ll laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  OK, well, actually, I&#39;ve been to an onsen too before.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Oh, really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  Yes I have. I actually, do really enjoy it. I think it&#39;s very relaxing. If you go to the big onsens, they have lots of different kinds of baths and one of them is called the &#34;Electric Bath&#34; and when you go into it you feel little tiny electric shocks and it&#39;s supposed to be good to increase your blood circulation, apparently.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Does it hurt?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane:
  </strong>
  When I went into that one I was very little, so I thought it hurt and I didn&#39;t really like it
