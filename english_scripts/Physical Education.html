   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Monica, you are actually a trained physical education teacher.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, we
  <span class="audionotes">
   often hear
  </span>
  about how kids today are not fit, and they don&#39;t exercise enough. Do you think that&#39;s true?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  I think it is true, yes. I think kids these days spend a lot more time on the computer than they used to, so of course that means less time outside and getting fit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, in some countries there&#39;s a big debate about how much fitness kids actually do in school, so in your country, in New Zealand, do kids still do a lot of fitness actually in school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Well, recently the
  <span class="audionotes">
   P.E.
  </span>
  curriculum got
  <span class="audionotes">
   amalgamated
  </span>
  with the health curriculum, so P.E. and health were considered to be important in school, and the health side of the
  <span class="audionotes">
   curriculum
  </span>
  is often taught in the classroom, and of course the P.E. side often taught outside the classroom, and there&#39;s always debate about how much kids should be doing inside school. In fact very recently, now that it has become quite a big problem in New Zealand for teenagers, there has been talk about increasing the number of P.E. lessons that students have, but the current Prime Minister I think believes that the emphasis should be put on out-of-school activities like clubs and encouraging students to become more involved in that side of things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do you feel? Do you think it should be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  I actually agree to be honest, because I think if you increase the number of P.E. lessons that students have in a week, it doesn&#39;t actually necessarily increase their motivation to be involved in physical activity, but if like he&#39;s suggesting, you increase the opportunities outside of school, students maybe become involved in a sport that they choose, that they&#39;d like to do and they hopefully can take it on as a lifetime sport. Yeah, which is important.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Butt wouldn&#39;t the counter argument be that only kids that have a natural
  <span class="audionotes">
   inclination
  </span>
  to play sports would want to join those clubs and if the kids that are more sedentary or don&#39;t enjoy physical activity won&#39;t join a club, so you need to actually make them do fitness at school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true. That is a counter argument, and a very good one … to argue on some other occasion. Of course I can talk about that side of the argument as well if you want me to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, it&#39;s Okay. Basically, you saw there&#39;s … both sides make a good point.
