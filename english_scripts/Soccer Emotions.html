  Valeria:
 </strong>
 How are the emotions? How do you live soccer from an emotional point of view?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s, if it&#39;s an important match you will
  <span class="audionotes">
   really get into it
  </span>
  even if you&#39;re not in the stadium you&#39;re watching it like on tele you will shout at the screen and you will shout...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Which kind of things will you
  <span class="audionotes">
   shout
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Pretty much insults to all the players and the referee.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Insults?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Like if they are not doing well you
  <span class="audionotes">
   insult
  </span>
  them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, obviously.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  On the television?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Even in front of the television, yeah. It might sound, it might
  <span class="audionotes">
   sound a bit weird
  </span>
  but at the same time we see football and we live football as a kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   stress relief
  </span>
  therapy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  I see. So if they are doing well, OK, you say like come on let&#39;s go and everything is fine?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  If they are not doing as well as you would like to, you will insult them in front of the television?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and sometimes with people we get to the point that when they cry if their team loses and I&#39;ve seen that many times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Wait, are you talking about men, Latin American men, crying?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, macho Latino men crying because of football, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  I see.
