  <em>
   Ikebana
  </em>
  , it&#39;s an
  <span class="audionotes">
   art of flowers
  </span>
  . It&#39;s quite different from Western style
  <span class="audionotes">
   flower arrangement
  </span>
  because in Ikebana&#39;s theory you can decorate one flower, only with one flower.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anili:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  The flower arrangement in Japan is not only decorating flowers but it&#39;s an art with flowers and
  <span class="audionotes">
   space
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anili:
  </strong>
  I see
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reiko:
  </strong>
  The air between the flowers and also the room and everything, it shows the space or even the universe in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anili:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s another Japanese art?
 </p>

   tea ceremony

  !
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anili:
  </strong>
  Tea ceremony?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reiko:
  </strong>
  Tea ceremony!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anili:
  </strong>
  Tea ceremony. Tell me about tea ceremony.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reiko:
  </strong>
  Tea ceremony. There&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   certain ways
  </span>
  you have to make tea. Not only make tea, there&#39;s a certain way to for example wipe a bowl.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anili:
  </strong>
  I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reiko:
  </strong>
  Yes, with one piece of cloth and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that  you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anili:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reiko:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so it&#39;s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   complicated
  </span>
  traditional procedure in a sense but..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anili:
  </strong>
  How do you learn that? Is that something that your mother would teach you?
                                          How do people learn that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reiko:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony. So you need to go to a school, yes, and learn from your teacher and their heirarchy and the organization. You need to pass each test to go
  <span class="audionotes">
   climb up the ladder
  </span>
  in the heirarchy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anili:
  </strong>
  I see. Fantastic. Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reiko:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
