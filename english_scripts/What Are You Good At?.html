   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Okay, Rory, are you good at sports?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah, I am. I&#39;m good at soccer, I think. And I run quite a lot. I&#39;m getting faster. So yeah, I think I&#39;m quite good at sports.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : No, not really. It&#39;s something that I never really practiced when I was a child so I&#39;m not really good at sports. But when people look at me, they always say, &#34;You look like you can run so fast. You look like you can play all these sports.&#34; I can run, but I don&#39;t do it often or played so many sports. Yup.

   Rory
  </b>
  : Okay. And are you good at math?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Yes. I feel like I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   bragging
  </span>
  when I say that but I enjoy math. And when I was in school, I did well in it. I think up to high school level math, I&#39;m good. What about you, Rory?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah, the same. So I think I&#39;m quite good at math. I enjoyed it at high school but I didn&#39;t do it after that. Now I help my daughter with her math homework, and yeah, I think I&#39;m pretty good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Lucky her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : And how about computers? Are you good at computers?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : I think I
  <span class="audionotes">
   have the basics down
  </span>
  . So I&#39;m good at the basic things in computers. But overall, when it gets too
  <span class="audionotes">
   complicated
  </span>
  , I&#39;m not too good at it. What about you, Rory?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : Yeah, I&#39;m okay. I can use a computer but I can&#39;t â€“ I&#39;m not good at programming, things like this, you know. I don&#39;t understand this.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : I think this is
  <span class="audionotes">
   a big one
  </span>
  for people. Are you good at getting up early?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : I&#39;m really good at getting up early.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : How early?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : You know 5:00 or 6:00 o&#39;clock is no problem for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : And I think it&#39;s because ever since I was young, I&#39;ve always got up early. I used to do
  <span class="audionotes">
   a paper round
  </span>
  when I was a kid.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory
  </b>
  : I get up before 6:00 o&#39;clock. So how about you? Are you good at getting up early?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Abidemi
  </b>
  : No, not really. I like to
  <span class="audionotes">
   sleep in
  </span>
  . Especially when it&#39;s winter, I&#39;m not good at getting up early at all. My body just wants to sleep the whole day. In the summer, I&#39;m a lot better with the sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Rory

  : Okay.
