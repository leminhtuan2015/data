  Nick:
 </strong>
 You&#39;ve lived in three different parts of the world, so is there any difference between each part in terms of physical contact?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I have lived in Hong Kong, Guam, and the U.S. Hong Kong is in Asia. Guam is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and the U.S. is American culture. So in Hong Kong I think most people would not touch each other, just give each other a little bow. I find that a bow is very common in Asia. If you&#39;re very good friends, you wouldn&#39;t really hug. Hugging I think is a very American thing to do. I think you would just touch each other on the shoulder, or give each other
  <span class="audionotes">
   a side embrace
  </span>
  . A mini-hug.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Guam, you would definitely greet your friends and family with a kiss on the cheek. A handshake is much too formal for island culture because Island culture is so relaxed and laid-back. You would only do a handshake with business partners or in a really
  <span class="audionotes">
   formal setting
  </span>
  , but usually a kiss on the cheek is what you receive and give when you see your family and friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the U.S., hugging is most common I think for friends and family, but if you&#39;re not friends and family, a handshake would probably be the most common.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Is a handshake always the same or is there different styles of handshake?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  From what I&#39;ve observed, Guam has American culture so Guam handshakes and U.S. handshakes are the same. I think in Hong Kong, it&#39;s got a bit of a British
  <span class="audionotes">
   background
  </span>
  , so that&#39;s also very similar. I don&#39;t see any difference with the handshake.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  So, what about young people? Is there a different way they interact physically with each other?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yes, definitely. In Guam, I always see people do a fist bump for close
  <span class="audionotes">
   buddies
  </span>
  of theirs. Girls would definitely hug and give each other a kiss. In Hong Kong, I don&#39;t see the
  <span class="audionotes">
   fist bump
  </span>
  often. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen it at all actually, but for close friends, I think a side embrace, or a semi-embrace would happen, but mostly just some form of touch or acknowledgement of the other person.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think it&#39;s also very common for people of the same sex to hold hands in Asia and just be friends. Woman and woman hold each others hand if they are very, very, very good friends, and it&#39;s apparently very normal. I don&#39;t know about a guy holding another guy&#39;s hand, but if a woman and a woman hold each other&#39;s hands, it does not signal that they are together as a couple. It might just signal that they are very, very good friends or sisters.
 </p>
 <p>

   Nick:
  </strong>
  In Australia that would be very strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yes, it would, wouldn&#39;t it. Even in America and Guam.
