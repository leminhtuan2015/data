  Katia:
 </strong>
 So, Enam, we&#39;re talking about arranged marriages, but what about the
 <span class="audionotes">
  rate of divorce
 </span>
 of arranged marriages? Is it high?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Enam:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, the rate is
  <span class="audionotes">
   incredibly low
  </span>
  . Actually, it&#39;s below ten percent and it&#39;s changing but still it&#39;s really low and the reason I think because the culture in Bangladesh ... in that kind of culture, boys and girls are like grown up in different ways, and they don&#39;t really see each other that closely, and that&#39;s why when you are married with a person, you start to know that person after different ... opposite gender ... quite well and that helps develop and understanding and they both ... both of them try to understand each other - their values - and in the cultural background it&#39;s normally decided that they have to be together normally without an exception for the rest of their lives, so they just try to work in that way. Do you have
  <span class="audionotes">
   a higher divorce rate
  </span>
  in your country?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Actually, unfortunately it is increasing. I really don&#39;t know the percentage but when I was young, if somebody of my friends parents would get a divorce that would be very shocking to hear. It was uncommon. But now, a lot of my friends actually are going though divorce or their parents have divorced, which it wasn&#39;t common but now it seems a little bit more common, so unfortunately things are changing in Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Enam:
  </strong>
  Why do you think that the divorce rate is going up? What could be the reason behind this?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s very hard to say but I think they&#39;re various reasons. For example, women didn&#39;t used to work. They used to stay home and take care of the house, the husband, the children, but now women have become more independent. They have been able to make different decisions that before they didn&#39;t have to, so I think the independence of the women has changed things and perhaps the culture itself,
  <span class="audionotes">
   the culture of marriage and divorce
  </span>
  , it has changed also so
  <span class="audionotes">
   I think possibly those two reasons
  </span>
  .
