   Danny:
  </strong>
  So, we&#39;ve been talking a lot about food. Do you have a favorite restaurant?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I do. I haven&#39;t been there for years, but it&#39;s still my favorite. It&#39;s called The Little Snail
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  The Little Snail.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  And it&#39;s a French restaurant, and it&#39;s in this small coastal fishing village down the coast. It&#39;s kind of funny because it&#39;s a great restaurant and you kind of expect it to be in a big city. It has really good French food, but it&#39;s in the
  <span class="audionotes">
   middle of nowhere
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  So, what&#39;s the decoration like then? What does it look like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s cute. It&#39;s very cute. I haven&#39;t been in many restaurants in France but it&#39;s kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   what I imagine
  </span>
  a French restaurant would look like, you know like , there&#39;s just a few things hanging on the walls and very simple decor, and it&#39;s just kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   cozy
  </span>
  like a country town.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  Cozy! Sounds nice. But how&#39;s the service?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Oh, it&#39;s okay.
  <span class="audionotes">
   You won&#39;t starve
  </span>
  . They don&#39;t have lots of staff, so it can get quite busy and you&#39;re gonna have to wait awhile, but you know, when the food arrives, it is so good that you do not care.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  Really? What&#39;s the food like then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Ah, well, I just love French food. It&#39;s my favorite cuisine and I usually can&#39;t afford to eat it however, but if do you like traditional French food, it is great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  Traditional French food? What&#39;s that like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Well, usually I get some kind of meat dish, maybe a quail or kind of another bird or something, and there&#39;s usually a really delicious sauce that might be made from wine or cream and herbs and that sort of thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  Sounds really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  It is really good. It&#39;s delicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  So you said you can&#39;t really afford to eat French food. What are the prices like ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Well, the Little Snail is good compared to a French restaurant that you get in a big city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Two people could eat there and have a really fantastic French meal for maybe about eight dollars, which is as I said, really good French restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s for two.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  For two?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  So is there anything special with the place?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Actually we used to go there when I was working. We would go on these business trips and my boss would take me and my other coworker there on the Friday night as a kind of thanks-for-working-hard reward. And we always used to have, I think it&#39;s called ------ I&#39;ve forgotten. My French is terrible, but it&#39;s this amazing dessert, which is kind of made with pastry, and has a sweet kind of custard creme inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Danny:
  </strong>
  Everyone loves custard. Sound delicious
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s really good.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I can&#39;t wait
  </span>
  to get back there.
