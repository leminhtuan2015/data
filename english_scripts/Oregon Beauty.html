  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from Oregon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Oregon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah. It&#39;s on the West Coast of America, above California and below Washington. It has the coast. It has the mountains and a lot of different regions really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Really, so which is your favorite of those for regions, which do you like the best?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s difficult. I like the coast a lot. The coast of Oregon is really, really rocky. It&#39;s really natural. In Washington it&#39;s really,
  <span class="audionotes">
   really developed
  </span>
  and in California as well, but in Oregon it&#39;s really, really natural - really rocky. There&#39;s beaches and you go out there and it&#39;s just nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Swimming? Fishing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s cold so there&#39;s not a lot of swimming. There&#39;s surfing. There&#39;s really good fishing. People fish. They take boats out. It&#39;s really nice, but...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Sounds good. So you have the ocean and then you can move inland to the woods.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah, from the ocean you move inland and you&#39;ve got a real green area. In fact, in gets some of the most rain in all of America really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So it is a rain forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, there are areas that are considered a rain forest. One of the biggest rain forests in America is there, but it&#39;s real wet, real green and really
  <span class="audionotes">
   mossy
  </span>
  . There&#39;s moss hanging off the trees. It&#39;s beautiful. The greenest place you&#39;ve ever seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  And then, so you had the beach, the ocean. You had the woodland. Is there any other types of regions or landscapes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, you got the real green area I talked about and then from there you go to the mountains, and the mountain kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   traps all the rain
  </span>
  . On the other side, it&#39;s really dry. It&#39;s called kind of a dessert region. Lots of cattle ranchers. Real dry. It gets snow. It&#39;s good for outdoor sports, but hardly any rain really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  And that is mostly, you say farmland?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yes. It&#39;s farmland. Ranching land.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Are there any cowboys?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s lots of cowboys, actually. Lots of cowboys. Lots of people think of Oregon as a real
  <span class="audionotes">
   liberal area
  </span>
  but on the other side of the mountains it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   real conservative
  </span>
  . So really two types of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So, you have those three regions. Do you have any big cities?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  We have Portland Oregon. It&#39;s a pretty big city. It&#39;s got a basketball team. It is a real nice city. It&#39;s got good public transportation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So would you like to live in Portland?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I&#39;d like to live in Portland. It&#39;s be OK, but there&#39;s two college towns that I think would be really good: Corvalis, Oregon and Eugene, Oregon. Real liberal college towns. They&#39;ve got really good places to eat and friendly people. A little more liberal and laid-back, so it&#39;s my type of place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So that sounds like a pretty good place to live. It has a little bit of everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Maybe I&#39;ll move there.
