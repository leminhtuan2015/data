   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Santi, now you are from Indonesia but you actually are Christian, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And now most people in Indonesia are Muslim.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so are there any other
  <span class="audionotes">
   major
  </span>
  religions in Indonesia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Oh, we have about six religions, actually: Muslim, Christians. We have two types of Christians: Catholic and Christians, and then we have Buddhists and Hindus and Confuciuos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you are Christian?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So do you have a ... do you celebrate Christmas specially, like Indonesian style?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  In my family - no - but maybe other families do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what do you normally do for Christmas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  We go to ... well, as a part of family, we go to the church together and then we celebrate ... well, going out for dinner, and then
  <span class="audionotes">
   that&#39;s all
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   not that big of a deal
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No Christmas tree?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No giving presents?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  No. Even for Christmas tree, my mom always tells that if you want to decorate the tree, you have to - well - clean it up later, so we just like ... yeah, maybe later on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You don&#39;t want to do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. OK, that&#39;s interesting. So Christmas is very basic and simple?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, actually that&#39;s kind of nice. I think a lot of people from other Christian countries would probably prefer that Christmas was that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Really? Well, as a children I expect a present actually from my parents but they don&#39;t give me so ... it&#39;s OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, were you
  <span class="audionotes">
   bummed
  </span>
  when you didn&#39;t get a present?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes, sometimes. Well, looking for other friends that they got presents, like, a bunch of presents from their parents or their uncles but, well, me and my sister just don&#39;t so ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s OK, though. I mean I think maybe that&#39;s even better because maybe that
  <span class="audionotes">
   teaches children a lesson
  </span>
  , you know. So does that mean you never get presents or gifts or money or anything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  No, but we have a special celebration for Chinese New Year because we are raised a Chinese family, so we got presents in Chinese New Year&#39;s.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you celebrate Chinese New Year more than you do Christmas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Santi:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s true.
