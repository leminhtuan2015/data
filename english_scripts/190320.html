Police in the Netherlands said Tuesday they are investigating terror as a possible motive behind a shooting in Utrecht on Monday in which three people were killed.
<br><br>
Dutch police say they've arrested a third person on suspicion of involvement in the shooting.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Charles De Ledesma reports.
<br><br>
A spokesman from Utrecht's public prosecution office says three people are now in custody, the alleged shooter, Gokmen Tanis, and two others.
<br><br>
Tanis is being held on suspicion of manslaughter with a possible terrorist motive, but the spokesman adds that investigations are continuing into what drove him to allegedly open fire in a tram on Monday morning.
<br><br>
Authorities have not ruled out other possible reasons and Dutch media has quoted neighbors of Tanis in Utrecht have speculated that the shooting may have been linked to a relationship.

President Trump welcomed Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to the White House Tuesday, praising the relatively new leader and promising closer trade ties and enhanced military cooperation.
<br><br>
"The relationship that we have right now with Brazil has never been better.  I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents.  There is zero hostility with me.  And we were going - we're going to look at that very, very strongly, in terms of whether it's NATO or it's something having to do with alliance."

In a speech to parliament on Tuesday, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told about acts of bravery by police officers and victims during the Christchurch terror attack.
<br><br>
"There will be countless stories, some of which we may never know, but to each, we acknowledge you in this place, in this House."
<br><br>
Officials have now begun releasing the bodies of the 50 people killed in last Friday's mass shooting at two mosques, allegedly by a white supremacist.

Hundreds of Islamic State fighters are making a last stand for the terror group's self-declared caliphate as they lost control of their "tent city" in the northeastern Syrian [of town] town of Baghuz in what U.S.-backed forces described as a significant blow.
<br><br>
Syrian Democratic Forces made the announcement Tuesday on social media following an operation which resulted in the capture of what they described as 157 experienced IS fighters, many of them from outside Syria and Iraq.

There are no accurate figures on the number killed by Tropical Cyclone Idai [on] in southeastern Africa.  But Mozambique's president is saying it could be as high as 1,000.
<br><br>
United Nations and international agencies are rushing aid to hundreds of survivors of the storm, which struck Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.
<br><br>
Correspondent Lisa Schlein reports for VOA from Geneva.
<br><br>
The Red Cross is issuing a $10 million flash appeal for emergency aid to the cyclone victims. The World Food Program reports it is rushing food and other assistance to large numbers of desperate people stranded by the rapidly rising flood waters in Mozambique.  It says the humanitarian emergency is getting bigger by the hour.
<br><br>
The U.N. Children's Fund also is issuing a flash appeal for $23 million to help many of the 260,000 children affected by the disaster.
<br><br>
WHO says it is sending emergency kits, trauma kits, and cholera kits to take care of the immediate health needs of the people on the ground.

The U.S. Defense Department has released a list of hundreds of military projects that might be cancelled or scaled back to free of money for President Trump's southern border wall.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports.
<br><br>
It's a 20-page list of projects across the U.S. and around the world worth about $13 billion that might be slashed to make way for the border wall.
<br><br>
House Democrats say when their colleagues see military plans being scaled back in their communities, it might push them to vote to override President Trump's veto of the message that would negate his emergency declaration.
<br><br>
One example, North Carolina, home to GOP Senator Thom Tillis, where $100 million is planed for water treatment improvements at Camp Lejeune and airfield security upgrades at the Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station.
<br><br>
But Republican leaders predict the veto override effort will fail.
