  Katia
 </strong>
 : Hey Todd. How was the party last Saturday?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It was fun, you should have come.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : I know but I had too many things to do so I just decided not to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : In the end it was a lot of fun. There was a lot of good food and everybody ate too much and drank too much a little bit but maybe next year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : All right, well it sounds great, maybe for next year. But listen, I have a party this coming Saturday, perhaps you want to join us?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ooh,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m always ready for a party
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : But you do have to bring food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK. Well you know I&#39;m not a very good cook so can I just buy something?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s not a problem. There will be maybe about ten to fifteen people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : And we&#39;ll have music, we&#39;ll have food and there will be students, there will be local people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So is there anything that you can recommend that I bring?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Perhaps something without meat, so everybody can eat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK. Are you a vegetarian?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Actually no, I&#39;m not a vegetarian but I believe there will be some people that cannot eat certain kinds of meat, so just to be on the safer side maybe just vegetables or a fruit salad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK. Maybe I&#39;ll make a vegetable tray, a vegetable platter or whatever and maybe cut up some carrots, cucumbers, maybe get some dip, how&#39;s that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : That sounds really good. I&#39;m getting hungry already.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Then of course I can maybe just bring a cake or a pie. There&#39;s a nice bakery shop that I know about, they make really good cakes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : OK. That sounds really good especially as I don&#39;t think anybody else will be bringing dessert.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Fantastic. Actually that&#39;s what I did last week at the party is I brought a chocolate cake so maybe I&#39;ll get the same one, it was really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : OK, that&#39;s sounds really good. I would like to try the chocolate cake.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So this party is it going to be just kind of a casual party, will people sit around and talk and drink or is it going to be dancing, what&#39;s going on?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : I really don&#39;t know, whatever people feel like doing, it&#39;s more like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   spontaneous
  </span>
  thing. If people want to talk, there&#39;ll be talking, there will be some music of course and different kinds of people so I&#39;m not sure what will be expected but as long as everybody enjoys a good time and talk and meet new people, so really no
  <span class="audionotes">
   expectations
  </span>
  just a good time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Actually I&#39;ve never been to your place. Is this at your apartment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yes, it&#39;s going to be at my apartment which is not very far from here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK. Do you have a big apartment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Considering the norm, it&#39;s a little bit bigger but not big
  <span class="audionotes">
   considering
  </span>
  other houses or other apartments.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Big enough for fifteen people?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : We can all fit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK. What about alcohol? Is it BYOB?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh really so just bring wine or beer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yes, yes. Anything that you want to bring that you want to drink yes, but food will be provided, the main food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : The main food, just the side stuff we bring?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And the dress, is it casual?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Just casual, yes casual, yes casual.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right, yeah. Actually when does it start?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : OK, it starts, you can come between eight thirty or nine, that&#39;s the time that people will be arriving or any time after or before really, so you can come any time but that&#39;s the time that people will be
  <span class="audionotes">
   gathering
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right and what time do you think it will be over?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s a very difficult question. It depends how people are enjoying it or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And how nice your neighbors are maybe?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Exactly. It should be all right though with the neighbors.
