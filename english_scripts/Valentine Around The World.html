 <strong>
  Mel:
 </strong>
 So, Doron, what did you do last Valentine&#39;s Day?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Last Valentine&#39;s day I got disappointed I think, cause I teach at university, and I&#39;d heard that Japanese students always give their teachers
  <span class="audionotes">
   loads and loads
  </span>
  of chocolate, and even though it was my fifth year, and every other year I only got like two or three, I was still really excited cause I&#39;m at university now and I got two chocolate bars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  How, about you? Are you looking forward to it this year?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m planning on going to Korea with my co-workers to
  <span class="audionotes">
   escape
  </span>
  the Valentine&#39;s Day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  To escape?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Atmosphere, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re not a fan then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  I like Valentine&#39;s Day, but I don&#39;t plan on celebrating it this year. Is Valentine&#39;s Day big in England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  I haven&#39;t lived in England for awhile now, about ten years. When I was a kid it was
  <span class="audionotes">
   big in
  </span>
  school, like in junior school, and we used to have a little Valentine&#39;s post box in your class where you could write little messages to your classmates and then you put it in the box and it&#39;d get delivered.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Oh, in a box?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Yeah, in a little Valentine&#39;s post box.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  The teacher would deliver them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Did you only get notes or did you get candy as well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  No, it was just notes. In England we don&#39;t really give candy and chocolate and presents to people. We just give letters, unless it&#39;s like a boyfriend or a girlfriend or something. But when you are seven, you don&#39;t really bother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Well, the thing I liked about Valentine&#39;s Day as a kid was that you&#39;d get Valentine&#39;s Day cards from everyone, but I was always curious to see what the boy I liked wrote to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Did you know who wrote what to you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, they would sign their name on the card.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  What? They sign names?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;d be like. Happy Valentine&#39;s Day Adam.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Oh, in England I don&#39;t think you don&#39;t put your name. Even if you know who it&#39;s from. You know it&#39;s from your girlfriend, or your best friend, or your grandma, or something, I think you just put a big question mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   half the fun
  </span>
  . You have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   figure it out
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  But my favorite Valentine&#39;s Day gift is always from my mom.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  She gives you a gift every year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  She&#39;ll send me gifts in the mail, and when I was in elementary school, she would hide chocolates and stuff in my desk. It was awesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s brilliant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t remember getting any really really cool Valentine&#39;s presents. I remember giving a couple. I was dating a girl who lived in Norway when I was at university in England and so for Valentine&#39;s Day is the same ... I think her birthday was February the 11th or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  So, I just flew over. I e-mailed like her best friend who I knew quite well as well and he picked me up at the airport I and flew over to Norway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  And in Norway, it&#39;s a very safe country, so they don&#39;t really lock their doors a bit like Japan, and he just drove me down to the house and I walked in at like nine in the morning, and she just came down stairs and she nearly died. She thought I was a ghost.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Yeah. That would be scary but fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Scary but fun. That&#39;s what she said when she could talk.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so it was a double birthday, Valentine&#39;s Day gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Doron:
  </strong>
  Exactly.
