  My favorite time of year is autumn, or fall. I like the fall season because I think that&#39;s when the weather&#39;s the best. It&#39;s not too hot. It&#39;s not too cold. It&#39;s just nice and cool all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, usually it doesn&#39;t rain that much in autumn. The trees also are really, really beautiful in the fall. I love the change in colors when the leaves turn from green to brown, and orange and yellow and I think it&#39;s also really pretty to see the leaves on the ground.

  Also, I really like fall because I&#39;m a big baseball fan and in the fall we have the baseball playoffs and it&#39;s the start of the basketball season and the football season, so it&#39;s a good time for me to watch sports on TV. Lastly, I like autumn because my birthday is in October, and um, October 2nd, and Halloween is in October and Thanksgiving is in November and these are all my, these are my three days throughout the year.

   My favorite season has to be autumn, although when it gets to autumn I feel slightly disapointed because I know that after summer the weather gets colder and the nights get shorter and the evenings get darker. I still really like autumn. One of my favorite things about autumn is whan all of the leaves fall off the trees and you can walk about and crunch in the leaves. However I think my favorite thing about autumn is the conkers. I love it when conkers fall off trees and you can collect them.

   When I was at school we used to collect conkers and put them on stings and then we would have a competition to see who had the best conker. We would hit our conkers with somebody elses and if yours didn&#39;t smash then you could have one point so after your first game, your conker would be a oner. Then if you won twice, it would be a twoer and so on. It was a really good game and it kept us amused for hours. Conkers are great fun. Have you ever played conkers? Maybe you should. Why don&#39;t you try it this autumn?
