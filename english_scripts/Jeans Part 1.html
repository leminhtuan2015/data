  Todd:
 </strong>
 Before musicians like you said used to wear ripped jeans. Jeans with big holes or rips in them.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, that was
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the 80&#39;s
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, maybe that was my generation. So that&#39;s not popular anymore?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Some people like to wear ripped jeans, yeah, still, but mainly the rips are quite neat, so they&#39;re usually ripped a little bit around the pockets or
  <span class="audionotes">
   around the cuffs
  </span>
  , you know the bottoms, Yeah

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, yeah. That sounds like designer jeans. Maybe then like.... are they specifically made just for that style?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Well, yeah. Actually, quite often the jeans you buy in the store are already ripped or already worn so they look like they&#39;re old but they are
  <span class="audionotes">
   brand new
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But designer jeans can be really expensive, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Oh, they can be very expensive but people are willing to pay the money because they&#39;re designer jeans. They&#39;re cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, how much do you pay for jeans?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  I can pay up to 120 Euros for jeans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A hundred and twenty Euros.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a lot of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a lot of money, yeah, especially because I&#39;m a student but I&#39;m willing to
  <span class="audionotes">
   put the money into it
  </span>
  if the jeans fit very well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Just, lastly about jeans, these days there&#39;s many different colors. You have the light blue jeans, or the darker blue jeans. Which colors do you like to wear?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  That depends on the time of the year actually. In the summer I like to wear light blue jeans and then in the winter I sometimes wear black jeans or really dark blue jeans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s interesting. So you change the color by season?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, generally I think I wear more darker clothes in the winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, just off hand, how many jeans do you think you have? How many pairs do you have at home?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  I think I have about
  <span class="audionotes">
   eight or nine pairs
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a lot but actually, I use only two pairs of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Your favorites?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, my favorite jeans. And they&#39;re baggy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, thanks Mariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome. My pleasure.
