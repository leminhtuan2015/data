    Tom:
   </strong>
   Joel, you speak Thai.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Yeah, a little bit.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   Your wife speaks English.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Yep, yep.

   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   So, at home, what language do you use?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   We usually speak English when we want to have
   <span class="audionotes">
    real communication
   </span>
   because her English is much better than my Thai, but I like to practice Thai a lot so when I&#39;m being a little more playful, when the topic isn&#39;t serious and we really don&#39;t need to communicate, then we&#39;ll speak in Thai and I get a chance to practice and it&#39;s also fun for her to listen to me speak in Thai and to teach me.
  </font>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   What&#39;s interesting is that, it depends also on who we&#39;re around, so for example if we&#39;re with my family and we want to say something
   <span class="audionotes">
    in private
   </span>
   , then we&#39;ll speak in Thai but if we&#39;re with her family and we want to say something privately then we&#39;ll speak in English so her family can&#39;t understand us.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   Don&#39;t your family think that&#39;s
   <span class="audionotes">
    quite rude
   </span>
   ?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Oh, they don&#39;t really, they don&#39;t really know what we&#39;re talking about so they can&#39;t be sure. It gets more
   <span class="audionotes">
    complicated
   </span>
   , though because she also speaks Japanese and I speak Japanese, so sometimes when we are with her brother who speaks English, we&#39;ll speak Japanese if we want to speak privately.

   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   And then again, there&#39;s your little kid. What language does he speak?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   I try to speak English most of the time when I&#39;m with him because I want to have him hear me
   <span class="audionotes">
    as a model
   </span>
   because he lives in Thailand so he&#39;s always hearing Thai and I want him to have a chance to hear some English but I find that since I&#39;m around Thai people all the time, they&#39;re speaking Thai to him, I start to get used to how they talk to him, and I start to kind of copy their examples, so sometimes it feels natural to me to speak Thai with him, but I try to speak English with him as much as I can.

   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   And what do you eat in your family?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Oh, we eat Thai food all the time, yeah. I like it much better than American food.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   Is it because you like it or because your wife is good at cooking it?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   I guess both. I mean, you can&#39;t really find much American food in Thailand so it&#39;s much easier to get and if you were going to go to a restaurant, like ***** or something, even though it&#39;s not so good, it&#39;s very expensive, so, both. I like Thai food better and it&#39;s just easier to get when you&#39;re there.

    Tom:
   </strong>
   With the different languages you can&#39;t really settle down together in front of the TV.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   She usually likes to watch English programs, though, so but it&#39;s hard for me to watch Thai programs. I usually, I get bored very quickly because I can&#39;t understand much.
