   Nick:
  </strong>
  Obviously from Seattle, there&#39;s many famous people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Ah, yes, from Seattle. We have Jimmy Hendrix.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Jimmy Hendrix. Wow! I love Jimmy Hendrix.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, he is a very famous musician, and we have his statues on the street in Seattle and he&#39;s quite the star in Seattle. But he&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   no longer around
  </span>
  unfortunately.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  I know. Really unfortunate. What an unfortunate death.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Any other famous Americans?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Well, there is plenty of famous Americans. Somebody in America who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, and his name as most of everybody listening probably already knows is Barack Obama.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Oh, really, I heard that. I read that in the newspaper this morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Oh did you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s pretty amazing. Some people think that he won it too early, too
  <span class="audionotes">
   prematurely
  </span>
  because he&#39;s only been in office. He&#39;s the President of the United States. He&#39;s been so only for nine months I believe, so it&#39;s quite early to give the Nobel Peace Prize for not really having done anything yet, his
  <span class="audionotes">
   detractors
  </span>
  say. But his supporters are really, really happy. It&#39;s a big prize. It&#39;s also a lot of pressure for one man in America to hold, and he&#39;s already President of the United States of America so that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a bigger burden
  </span>
  on him. He has to
  <span class="audionotes">
   hold up to
  </span>
  the pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Is there any famous sports people? Like, I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Hmm, sports people? Well, one person I can think of that&#39;s very famous in America recently is Michael Phelps. He is a twenty â€¦ a young twenty-something guy who is probably the best swimmer in history.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Oh, Ian Thorpe is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  He recently won many, many gold medals in the 2000 Beijing Olympics. He probably won the most I think. He broke the record for having won the most. I believe it was eight medals. Eight gold medals for a swimming competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  I think Ian Thorpe only won six in one Olympics. Michael Phelps takes it out.
