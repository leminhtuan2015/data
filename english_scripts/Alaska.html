  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Asako, you lived in the United States for a long time.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  For six years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a pretty long time
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Where did you live?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  I lived in Alaska.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Alaska.

   The last frontier

 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m an unusual one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, yeah, cause usually when people go and live in America for a long time, they don&#39;t choose Alaska.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s right, but Alaska is such a beautiful state.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why did you choose Alaska?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Well, I went to university there. There was a university. I wanted to go. That is the reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And then you stayed for six years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   I fell in love
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Just beautiful. That&#39;s it. Just beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what do you remember most about Alaska?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Wilderness. Mountains. Glaciers. Mosquitos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mosquitos?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Mosquitos.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Big ones
  </span>
  . Really big. You can&#39;t see such a big mosquito anywhere else on this island, not on any other place, but huge mosquitos.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Some people say
  </span>
  mosquitos are actually the state birds of Alaska.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The state bird. Really. So obviously there&#39;s lots of beautiful things and the mosquitos, but what else? Like what was the city like? I mean, was it a big city or a small city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Well, the biggest city is called Anchorage, and... but it&#39;s not really big-big. In the middle... the biggest street in Anchorage you can see moose.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You can see moose?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Just walking around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Walking around. Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  In the city there&#39;s moose?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  Yes. Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now can you go up and pet them like....
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Asako:
  </strong>
  No, never. Never. They are wild things. You can&#39;t pet them, but, I mean, they are very, very calm and nice animals but if you meet a mother moose and if there are children, her children are around, they can be really mean. So you don&#39;t really pet them. You can look at them and admire them, but that&#39;s it. Beautiful things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s good to know.
