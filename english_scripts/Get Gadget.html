    Joel:
   </strong>
   So, I know a lot of things are cheaper in Thailand, but like electronics,
   <span class="span_blue">
    are they cheaper in Thailand
   </span>
   <span class="audionotes">
    or
   </span>
   <span class="span_blue">
    cheaper in Japan?
   </span>
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s a difficult question. I think electrical
   <span class="span_blue">
    <span class="audionotes">
     accessories
    </span>
   </span>
   are cheaper in Thailand. Do you know what I mean by that? I mean, the plug-ins, like if you want a computer mouse or programs or.

   <strong>
    Joel:
   </strong>
   Like a memory stick.

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   Memory sticks, yeah. They&#39;re always cheaper.

   Cheaper in Thailand?

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   In Thailand, yeah. (and) I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s maybe about 30%,
   <span class="span_blue">
    <span class="audionotes">
     20 or 30%
    </span>
   </span>
   <span class="audionotes">
    less
   </span>
   than you would find it in Japan.

 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   But things like computers and cameras: the shop price is about the same. If you want to get
   <span class="span_blue">
    those
   </span>
   cheaper,
   <span class="span_blue">
    <span class="audionotes">
     you&#39;re better off
    </span>
   </span>
   going duty-free. When you&#39;re going through the airport the first time, check out the stores, check out what they&#39;ve got. They always have a very
   <span class="span_blue">
    <span class="audionotes">
     limited selection
    </span>
   </span>
   in duty-free shops, and then when you&#39;re on holiday, go onto the internet and find out about the products you saw in shops, so that when you&#39;re on your way home, you can pick it up at duty-free and that way you save, you can make big savings. You can make big deals.

    Joel:
   </strong>
   I see, so you just figure out what you want, when you go to the shops, but then you buy it all at the airport.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   The difficult thing is the airport shops don&#39;t have the
   <span class="span_blue">
    full-range
   </span>
   . They only have the latest stuff and the best stuff, so in a way, you&#39;re getting top-quality at a bargain price, but you do need to do the research first.

    Joel:

   Are you going to buy anything when you go back for holiday?

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Tom:
   </strong>
   I&#39;ve just done a lot of shopping. I think the holidays is going to take all of my money out, but there&#39;s a few little things I need to get: some hook-ups for my computer.
