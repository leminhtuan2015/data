  Mari:
 </strong>
 Hey, Mike, so we live in the countryside, and we go to school up on a mountain. Could you see yourself living here?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, I do really like living in the country, but I don&#39;t think I could stay here for a long period of time, even though I do like staying here for the period that we are here now.

   Mari:
  </strong>
  Where do you want to live?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;ve never lived in a big city, so I think that I would like to try to live in a big city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Like which one?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Possibly one
  </span>
  like New York or London. I think, I&#39;ve always seen it on TV and I&#39;ve always wanted to try to live there but I&#39;ve never, so I thing that would probably be really interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   What attracts you
  </span>
  to those cities?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  I guess just the diversity that you might find or just the fact that so much
  <span class="audionotes">
   stuff is going on
  </span>
  in the city. I might like to see how that lifestyle is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Sounds cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I couldn&#39;t see myself living here in the long-term. I grew up in two really big cities so... and I&#39;ve moved around a lot and... so in the future, I think I just want to stay in one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  What types of cities?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I guess a big city in Japan. My parents live here, so I feel like I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   more inclined
  </span>
  to live here. My brother lives in the States and so if we both lived in the United States, I think my parents would feel a little bit lonely so I feel more inclined to live in Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Which city in Japan would you like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  My parents live near Osaka. I grew up in Tokyo. I&#39;m thinking maybe like Kobe. I think that... I like Kobe a lot because it&#39;s like an international port city, or originally it was. We have the ocean, the water, and the mountain and it just seems like a very
  <span class="audionotes">
   cosmopolitan
  </span>
  city to me in Japan.
