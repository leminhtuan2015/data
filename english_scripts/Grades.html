   Todd:
  </strong>
  What about the idea that some people think that maybe there should be no grades? That there is just maybe you achieve or don&#39;t achieve. It&#39;s more
  <span class="audionotes">
   binary
  </span>
  . Either yes or no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t really know how I feel about that. I went to a school when I was younger that actually didn&#39;t have ... everybody was just put together in a large room and different teachers worked with different students according to their abilities and there were no grades. As an adult now, I&#39;m not really sure how I feel about that system. I wasn&#39;t there long enough to see what I could do with that environment. If it
  <span class="audionotes">
   benefited
  </span>
  me, or if it was to my
  <span class="audionotes">
   detriment
  </span>
  , so I really don&#39;t have an opinion on that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How about when you were younger, were you often stressed about your grades?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  Yes. Yes, I was. I was very stressed. I used to stay up until three or four o&#39;clock in the morning trying to complete projects. Studying all the time. I also did track, so I was very worried. You&#39;re in competition with your classmates because later on you have to go and get into college and then you have to get a job and it all starts in primary and secondary school, so it&#39;s important to do well there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you&#39;re very young but later in life with children, would you want your children to worry about grades, or would you want to be a parent that tell them &#34;huh, not so much!&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  No, they will definitely be ... if I have children, they will definitely be concerned about the grades that they&#39;re earning, and I will not be
  <span class="audionotes">
   easy on
  </span>
  them in that regard at all. So, they
  <span class="audionotes">
   have a lot coming to them
  </span>
  .
