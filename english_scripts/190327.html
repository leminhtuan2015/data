The U.S. House failed to override President Donald Trump's veto Tuesday of a resolution blocking his emergency declaration at the southern border.
<br><br>
AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani has details.
<br><br>
It's a win in his bid to spend billions more on border barriers but actually doing it will likely be held up by long court battles.
<br><br>
He declared the emergency after Congress authorized far less money than he wanted for the barriers.
<br><br>
Both chambers approved a resolution blocking the declaration.  He issued the veto almost immediately.

The Trump administration says it wants the entire Affordable Care Act, known as "Obamacare," struck down.
<br><br>
In a filing Monday with a federal appeals court, the administration said the entire law should be struck as unconstitutional.  Previously, the administration had called only for parts of it to go.
<br><br>
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says this could leave millions of Americans without coverage.
<br><br>
"President Trump said the Republican Party will be the party of healthcare.  If that is true, God help middle-class Americans."
<br><br>
House Minority Whip Steve Scalise says the GOP healthcare plan will continue the protections for people who've already been diagnosed with an ailment.
<br><br>
"We will number one protect people with preexisting condition.  We strongly support that.  And we also want to lower premiums.  This is the big difference between Republicans and Democrats from Washington.  We want a healthcare plan where families can choose the doctor of their choice from wherever they wanna buy a policy."

Millions of people benefit from the ACA's taxpayer-subsidized private insurance plans but enrollment is declining.

A Justice Department official says it will take Attorney General William Barr "weeks' not months" to finish revealing special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report and make a version available for the public.
<br><br>
The official spoke on the condition of anonymity Tuesday as Republicans say it's time to move on from the investigation of now disproven allegations of collusion.

Israel's U.N. ambassador is warning Gaza's Hamas rulers if attacks continue Hamas leaders will face the "might of the Israeli military."
<br><br>
Hamas fired a rocket Monday that hit a home in central Israel, wounding seven people.  Israel responded with airstrikes and Palestinian militants fired rockets before an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire appeared to take hold early Tuesday.

Cyclone relief operations are moving deeper into remote Mozambique as experts now fear a spread of disease.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Charles De Ledesma reports.
<br><br>
Relief operations are pressing into rural Mozambique where an unknown number of people remain without aid while World Health Organization officials warned of a "second disaster" if disease breaks out.  They fear a "spike" in malaria cases in Mozambique.  The disease-carrying mosquitoes breed in standing water.
<br><br>
WHO says 900,000 oral cholera vaccines are expected to arrive later this week.
<br><br>
However, the United Nations says some 1.8 million people still need urgent help and has made an emergency appeal for $282 million for the next three months.

Prosecutors in Chicago have dropped all charges against "Empire" TV actor Jussie Smollett.
<br><br>
AP's Ed Donahue reports.
<br><br>
Smollett was accused of lying that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.
<br><br>
Prosecutors in Chicago say they still believe Smollett made it all up and angry Mayor Rahm Emanuel calls it "a whitewash of justice."
<br><br>
Prosecutors say one the reasons charges were dropped was because they want to focus resources on Chicago's gun violence.  "Mr. Smollett is still saying that he is innocent, still running down the Chicago Police Department.  How dare him?"
<br><br>
Usually, when charges are dropped, the defendant accepts responsibility or offers an apology.  "I've been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one.  I would not be my mother's son if I was capable of one drop of what I've been accused of."
<br><br>
Smollett did agree to do community service.

A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 Max made a safe emergency landing Tuesday in Orlando after experiencing an engine problem.
<br><br>
AP correspondent ??? reports the jet is part of the fleet that's been grounded.
<br><br>
"Southwest was shuttling the plane from Orlando out to Victorville, California, where it's storing all the Maxes while grounded ???out the desert.  But let us better, as this plane was taking off, it had some sort of engine trouble and had a turnback to the airport.  The crew declared an emergency and landed safely and had nothing to do with the software problem suspected in both the prior crashes."
<br><br>
That's AP correspondent ??? reporting.
<br><br>
Airlines are allowed to move the grounded planes as long as they don't have any passengers.
