   Todd:
  </strong>
  So,
  <span class="audionotes">
   going back to
  </span>
  before you went in to the army, what made you get so big? Was it just that you were sitting all day? Were you eating hamburgers everyday or what were you doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   blame
  </span>
  American culture ... but
  <span class="audionotes">
   as you said
  </span>
  , like pizzas, like especially not Italian pizza but like Pizza Hut, like American pizzas and hamburgers made me really big. And I really liked that ... like coke and stuff and that made me really big. I always liked reading books. Reading books and eating something was my only hobby that I did at my home. I really didn&#39;t like to exercise or join the soccer games with my friends. I was just a really quiet person, but in the army I had to change. I had to learn how to fight, I had to learn how to, you know, move my body Everything was for protect our country but besides that, I became more healthy too. I really appreciate that thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that is a great story actually. So ... but you said that you are healthy now and you&#39;ve lost all this weight but you used to eat burgers and pizzas. Do you eat them still, sometimes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  Sometimes, yeah it&#39;s hard but you know, all the temptation of that is always tough but I&#39;m still,you know, I won&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   deny
  </span>
  that. I really like burgers or pizzas even now ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh I&#39;m with you man, I like it too!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  But I am trying to avoid it ... I still now, I prefer water than coke. But I still like, you know, sweet things or something but still now, you know last point, even I have changed a lot but I have to keep that &#39;til even now, but there is &#34;
  <span class="audionotes">
   no pain, no gain
  </span>
  &#34; - I got the word from the army ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  And I have to keep this, I wanna ... I like the way I am now and if I wanna keep this, I have to, you know, do many things for me. I have to pay it
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well you look fantastic. I have only known you the size you are now, so I can&#39;t imagine you being 117 kilos so ... I can&#39;t wait to see the photos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  OK, I&#39;ll give you the photos later, you can see it. I&#39;ll show you that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, thanks man.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  OK, see you later.
