    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Akane, I hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;m being rude but you look amazing. Have you lost weight?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Actually, I have.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Wow. How did you do it?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well, I&#39;ve been really eating healthy and working out a bit as well.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Wow. I read recently actually in the newspaper that there are lots of new gyms opening up.
   <br>
   Is that what you&#39;ve been doing, going to the gym?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Ah, yeah actually. I joined a new gym. It wasn&#39;t that expensive either and it&#39;s been really good.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So, how much was it?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   It was about $30 a month. (Oh) Yeah.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So when you so to the gym, what kind of thing do you do?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Um, well, my favorite thing to do is to run on the treadmill, and sometimes I also do weights.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   You do weights as well? (Mm-hm) Really heavy weights?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   No just lighter ones.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, I see.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So do you mind the fact when you&#39;re in the gym the air is really stuffy and you can always smell people&#39;s sweat? Does that not bother you?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   It does actually bother me so I do prefer to go when it&#39;s not too crowded.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Of course, yeah.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   People tend to go after work so I try to go a little bit earlier, or a little bit later. That&#39;s a good plan.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   But you know, sometimes I still wonder if it&#39;s healthy to exercise inside because if you
   <br>
   exercise outside you can get more fresh air.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   I think you&#39;re right about that. It does feel better when I do get exercise outside,
   <br>
   but sometimes I&#39;m so busy and if the weather&#39;s not good, it&#39;s just easier to go the gym.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, I suppose so.
   <br>
   <br>
  </font>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah, and a little exercise inside is better than no exercise.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   You&#39;re right actually.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   So if I want to lose weight, what would you recommend?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Basically, just exercise within you limits and eat healthy.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   I think it&#39;s just common sense.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Really. Do you think I&#39;ll lose weight.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   For sure. I think so, but I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. You definitely don&#39;t need to lose weight.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Well, that&#39;s kind of you Akane. OK, thanks.
