  Jess:
 </strong>
 OK, so Tom, I&#39;ve told you all about my beauty regime. You look very well groomed. Could you tell me what do you do to keep yourself looking good?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  Well, thank you Jess. I mean this look is the product of many
  <span class="audionotes">
   stages of evolution
  </span>
  . When I was a teenager, I had long hair pulled back in a pony-tail, but at that time I wasn&#39;t growing a beard yet so I did get mistaken for a girl, so since then I&#39;ve had short hair. There have been some periods when I&#39;ve been traveling and when I&#39;m traveling I don&#39;t like to bother too much about grooming, and my beard has started to grow, and it was a couple of years back that I went back to my job after traveling. I didn&#39;t have time to shave, and my colleagues and students saw me with a full beard, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   to be honest
  </span>
  they weren&#39;t as rude as I thought there were going to be, and I thought well maybe this looks good, so I thought I&#39;d keep that. The beard lasted perhaps a year and then it began disappearing and appearing
  <span class="audionotes">
   according to my whim
  </span>
  and now
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;ve settled on
  </span>
  a goatee which is where I shave my cheeks and underneath my chin, but I keep the mustache and and beard around my mouth. I&#39;ve never grown sideburns because
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m a little embarrassed to say
  </span>
  , I&#39;ve never managed to get the connection between my beard and my hair. There&#39;s a little gap just by my ears which never has quite grown hair, so that&#39;s where we got to where we are today.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  And have you ever removed hair from, waxed or shaved or any other part method from any other part of your body?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  Do you mean my legs? No, I have never shaved my legs. I&#39;m not a very hairy guy, but I just don&#39;t feel comfortable with men shaving their legs. A friend at university was a cyclist and he always shaved his legs and I thought it was strange because ... I mean, seriously, is
  <span class="audionotes">
   wind resistance
  </span>
  that important that you need to shave you legs to get the extra bit of speed on a bicycle, but he explained to me, &#34;No&#34;, it&#39;s to do with evening after cycling and you have to get a sports massage and a massage is much easier if you don&#39;t have hair on your legs. I always thought it was about wind resistance, but I was completely wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  So, it sounds like in comparison to mine your beauty regime is very simple.
