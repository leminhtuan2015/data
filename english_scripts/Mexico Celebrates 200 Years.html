   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Hi, this is Silvia. I&#39;m from Guatemala.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  And this is Diego. I&#39;m from Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  I want to talk about Mexico today. I know your independence is coming soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes, Mexico&#39;s Independence Day is September 16, but we usually start celebrating the night of the 15th, and it&#39;s usually a long weekend so everybody has holidays.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  And what do you do for that day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  We do a lot of traditional things. The first one and the most
  <span class="audionotes">
   obvious one
  </span>
  is we gather to eat a lot. We eat the most traditional food or dishes. One of them is Chiles en Nogada. And chiles is peppers, like you know, and what is so interesting about this dish is that it has the same colors of the Mexican flag, like it&#39;s red, white and green, and well the peppers are green and it has like a white sauce on top and it has these sort of like fruity grains that are red on top, so it&#39;s really, really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  What else? Apart from the food? Do you have any activities that you do that day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes, we usually refer to this holiday as like the screaming day because when the
  <span class="audionotes">
   War for Independence
  </span>
  occurred there was this priest or this independence character that was like screaming to the people to
  <span class="audionotes">
   fight for liberty
  </span>
  so in each independence party there&#39;s usually this guy who
  <span class="audionotes">
   reenacts
  </span>
  that and he rings the bell and he starts screaming like liberty and freedom, so we usually do that and it&#39;s quite funny I guess. It&#39;s very amusing for people who see it for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  And it&#39;s always on the same time, am I right? Is there a specific .... I remember someone telling me that it&#39;s at a certain time, like at midnight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  It is at midnight. You do it like I said. We celebrate on the night of the 15th and then
  <span class="audionotes">
   as soon as
  </span>
  it turns to the 16th that&#39;s when that happens.
