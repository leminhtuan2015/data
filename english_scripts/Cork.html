   Eucharia, can you talk about where you are from?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Eucharia:
   </strong>
   I’m from Ireland and I’m from the second biggest city in Ireland which is Cork. Now the name ‘Cork’ doesn’t come from wine bottle cork, it comes from the irish word ‘kirkig’ which is ‘marsh’ so you can imagine how wet Cork is. We have a lot of rain.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   And is Cork a big city?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Eucharia:
   </strong>
   It’s a sprawling city. Most people live outside of the city and commute and my parents live about a 25 minute walk to the city centre and that’s quite normal, so most of the city spreads outwards and the surburbs tend to be quite big and you can get lost quite easily!

    Todd:
   </strong>
   What are the people in Cork like?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Eucharia:
   </strong>
   Well when I go home its really strange for me because the men in my city speak with a very high pitched accent voice so it sounds very strange to me, and girls tend to speak in a lower voice because a lower voice in Ireland usually means intelligent and most people would like to seem intelligent. However, most people love to laugh in Cork so there is a really good sense of humour: you just walk on the streets and you hear people laughing all of the time. It’s great.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh that’s nice. And what would you say is the best thing about your city?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Eucharia:
   </strong>
   The best thing are the people of course, but also the food. The entertainment is just fantastic. Every night you can go out, you can have dinner. After you can go to the theatre, you can go to classical music concerts, you can go to pop concerts, rock concerts. You can go dancing, different types of dancing. Oh I miss dancing! You can do Irish dancing, more Hip hop dancing, disco dancing. Anything is possible any night of the week.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Ok and what’s the worst thing about your city?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Eucharia:
   </strong>
   The worst thing has to be rain because Cork is such a wet place. We don’t have a lot of snow in Cork because when it snows the snow quickly fades away because the ground is made of limestone so I’ve never seen real snow before, but getting back to the rain, it rains almost non stop from autumn until spring.

   Still it sounds like a nice place.
