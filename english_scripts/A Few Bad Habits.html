  Erina:
 </strong>
 So Mike, do you have any bad habits?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Of course not. I&#39;m perfect, I&#39;ve no habits that are bad. Yes, I do have some bad habits. One of my bad habits is fidgeting and I think I&#39;m a very high energy person so, especially when I&#39;m on the phone, mixed with my slightly
  <span class="audionotes">
   obsessive compulsive
  </span>
  tendencies, I tend to arrange all the things on a desk so if there are pens and books and different things on the desk, I would be turning them and arranging them in order and pretty much always using my hands and keeping them busy and although this might not be such a bad habit, perhaps for people who are with me or next to me they might be a little bit uncomfortable because it seems like, you know, I&#39;m a bit nervous or, you know, have something on my mind so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Not in confidence for your speech, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Right, in fact that&#39;s not the case but what happens is I start playing with things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve seen you do that before.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Oh have you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well then I guess that really shows it is one of my bad habits. You know, I think that I do that to focus because, you know, while I&#39;m speaking to somebody or while I&#39;m on the phone, I arrange things on the desk and that is kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   metaphorically
  </span>
  me arranging my thoughts in my head which is probably where this habit has come from.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  I see. Yeah, do you have any other bad habits other than fidgeting?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well maybe a bad habit is driving quickly and I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s considered a bad habit but I guess when I get behind the wheel of a car I sometimes get
  <span class="audionotes">
   impatient
  </span>
  and that impatience drives me to put more weight on the gas pedal and
  <span class="audionotes">
   in turn
  </span>
  I go faster and of course speeding is not a good thing especially when you get pulled over by the police. So that&#39;s a bad habit that I might have to work on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Yeah, definitely. You don&#39;t want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   lose your licence
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  No.
