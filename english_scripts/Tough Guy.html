   Ann:
  </strong>
  Hey, Nobu! I&#39;ve heard that you practice martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Can you tell me about K1?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  Yes. Well actually, what I practice is a type of martial arts called
  <span class="audionotes">
   mixed martial arts
  </span>
  .
  <span class="audionotes">
   No holds barred
  </span>
  ! Mixed martial arts is a mixture of everything, kick boxing,  boxing wrestling, submission fighting, so on and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  What are you best at? What do you like practicing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  I am very good at grappling. Grappling is the type of sports that you
  <span class="audionotes">
   kill your opponent&#39;s joint
  </span>
  and
  <span class="audionotes">
   choke him out
  </span>
  or anything like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  Do you use your hands or your feet a lot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  Hands, feet, legs, every part of your body.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  Biting?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  No biting. No biting, no
  <span class="audionotes">
   fish-hooking
  </span>
  , no groin striking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  What is the fish-hook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  The fish-hook is a kind of illegal movement that you use two fingers. Point finger and middle finger hooking your nose or eyes. Like that!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  Sounds dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  Yes!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  Do you ever compete?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  Yes, I compete a lot. Actually,  I was a champion back in the States.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  In the States?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  What kind of champion were you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  Grappling champion.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  Grappling champion. What did you win?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  Well, I entered this grappling tournament called Western Grappling Tournament. I won first place in 185 division, 185 pound division.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ann:
  </strong>
  All right, that&#39;s great! Thanks a lot for that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nobu:
  </strong>
  Thank you.
