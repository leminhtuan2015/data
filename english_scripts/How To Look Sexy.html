    Todd:
   </strong>
   So, Jeyong, you like to go to night clubs. When you go to a night club,
                                          what do kids wear these days? Like what makes you look cool in a night
                                          club or how should you dress?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   These days being sexy is what kids prefer, and
                                          by saying sexy, wearing a tank top, and a top that shows a lot of your
                                          skin.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, a lot of skin. So tank tops. What about a
                                          guy? What would a guy wear for a shirt?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   A guy would be wearing
   <span class="audionotes">
    casual
   </span>
   hip-hop pants,
                                          and maybe a polo shirt.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   A polo shirt.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   Or a top.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Like just a t-shirt.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   T-shirt.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, now for a, would a girl wear hip-hop pants?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   No, girls wear also sexy clothes, maybe short
                                          skirts or comfortable jeans with high heels.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   High heels! Now aren&#39;t high
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">
    heels
   </span>
   hard to dance in?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   They are actually, but then it looks better
                                          with high heels on. They look taller.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, what do the guys wear? Obviously they don&#39;t
                                          wear high heels.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   No. Guys wear
   <span class="audionotes" style="font-weight: bold;">
    sneakers
   </span>
   .
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Ah, sneakers. OK. Now do you wear anytime of
                                          jewelry or anything? Do you wear necklaces or?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   I personally don&#39;t wear a necklaces but
                                          earrings. Big hoops. Silver ones. Those look really pretty at the clubs
                                          because it kind of
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">
    shines
   </span>
   , and
                                          make-up is really important, too.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Really! OK.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   Like for eyelashes, you want to have a really
                                          strong look for your eyes, and maybe lip-gloss, would look good on too.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Now, do the men wear make-up these days?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   No, but then perfume would be a nice thing to
                                          put on guys.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK. Now you said you want to look sexy, right,
                                          but you&#39;re 19, so when you go to the night club, can you leave your
                                          house looking like that, or is that something you have to
   <span class="audionotes" style="font-weight: bold;">
    hide
   </span>
   <span class="audionotes">
    from
   </span>
   your parents?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Jeyong:
   </strong>
   First, of all I don&#39;t go to night clubs that
                                          often because I&#39;m not a party-party girl, but then I like dancing so I
                                          only went to club once when I was in Korea and I actually
   <span class="audionotes">
    told my
                                            parents the truth
   </span>
   that I am going to a party at a club so it was
                                          alright for me to wear sexy clothes and then leave home.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Ah, that&#39;s good, you have very
   <span class="audionotes" style="font-weight: bold;">
    supportive
   </span>
   parents. OK, well thanks.
