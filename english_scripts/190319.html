Following an hours-long manhunt, Dutch police have arrested a suspect in a shooting incident on a tram which left three people dead and five others wounded in the city of Utrecht on Monday.
<br><br>
Ferd Grapperhaus is the Dutch justice minister.  "Fortunately, this person was on camera, on the surveillance camera of the tramway.  So we were able to very soon spot him, to also connect him to a runaway car in which he had fled from the place of the assault.  So we have now arrested him.  We do not know as yet as to what his motives are."
<br><br>
Police had earlier identified the suspect as 37-year-old Turkish-born Gokmen Tanis, releasing a photo of a bearded man sitting at the tram wearing a dark blue hooded top.

Officials in Mali have put the death toll from Sunday's militant attack on an army camp at the village of Dioura at 23.
<br><br>
Suspected jihadists briefly seized the base in the central Mopti region and officials blamed Sunday's attack on deserter army colonel-turned-terrorist leader Ba Ag Moussa, who is said to be close to a Tuareg military (militant) chief with ties to al-Qaeda.

The U.S. Defense Department has provided Congress with a list of possible military construction projects that it could use to help pay for the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that President Donald Trump has ordered to be constructed.
<br><br>
Acting Pentagon Chief Patrick Shanahan sent the list to Congress on Monday.
<br><br>
Defense Department officials say not all the projects on the list would be cut as the combined cost of all the listed construction is around $12.9 billion, far more than the 3.6 billion that President Trump has sought to take from the military budget.

The speaker of Britain's House of Commons may have dealt a potentially fatal blow to Prime Minister Theresa May's ailing Brexit deal.
<br><br>
"What the government cannot legitimately do is to resubmit to the House the same proposition or substantially the same proposition as that of last week which was rejected by 149 votes." :Speaker of Britain's House of Commons John Bercow.
<br><br>
The government intended to try a third time to get lawmakers to back the deal, ideally before the prime minister joins EU leaders Thursday at a Brussels summit where she is set to ask the bloc to postpone Britain's departure.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Monday that her department may have been founded to combat terrorism, but its mission is shifting to also confront emerging online threats.
<br><br>
With more, here is Sagar Meghani.
<br><br>
When DHS was founded after 9/11, Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says it had one main mission "the war on terror."
<br><br>
The role has shifted with technology.  With the nation facing threats in cyberspace, Nielsen says it's no longer just troops and federal agents on the front lines.
<br><br>
"It's U.S. companies.  It's our schools and gathering places.  It's ordinary, everyday Americans."
<br><br>
Nielsen says enemies are mercilessly targeting everybody's phones and networks.  She says China and Iran are among the nations mimicking Russian election interference tactics and America needs an all-of-society approach to fighting back.

For Russia, Venezuelan President Nichol&aacute;s Maduro remains the country's only legitimate leader.  Russian officials are expected to emphasize this point when they meet with the U.S. special envoy for Venezuela in Rome on Monday and Tuesday.
<br><br>
The U.S. and some 50 other nations have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaid&oacute; as Venezuela's interim president.
<br><br>
Russia is to reiterate its position that a U.S. military intervention in the South American country would be inappropriate, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency on Sunday.
<br><br>
