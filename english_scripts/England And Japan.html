   Todd:
  </strong>
  Clare, you&#39;re from England.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clare:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How would you compare England and Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clare:
  </strong>
  Well, I think.. let&#39;s take
  <span class="audionotes">
   price-wise
  </span>
  , they&#39;re actually quite similar. Well, not maybe not England as a whole but say Japan and London is very similar. I found in supermarkets, in housing and things like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other respects, the people are certainly different. I mean, British people are
  <span class="audionotes">
   renowned
  </span>
  to be very polite as Japanese people are too. Japanese people are very helpful as well, probably more so than British people I would say. Mm, what else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What about the weather?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clare:
  </strong>
  The weather? Well, it&#39;s been raining a lot in Japan recently so we could say that it&#39;s quite similar, although actually, when I was e-mailing my parents they&#39;ve been
  <span class="audionotes">
   going on about
  </span>
  how there hasn&#39;t been much rain the past couple of months and how they think there is going to be a drought. That typical British
  <span class="audionotes">
   stereotype
  </span>
  of the weather is not true at the minute and it&#39;s probably wetter in Japan. But yeah, I think that climate wise it&#39;s quite similar in terms of temperature. It&#39;s definitely much more
  <span class="audionotes">
   humid
  </span>
  here than at home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Thanks a lot.
