   I&#39;m an English teacher in Japan and when I first came here I didn&#39;t really have very much money so I found things quite expensive and I went out looking for cheap bargains. I came across a shop and it called the 100 Yen shop. It&#39;s absolutely fantastic. 100 Yen is about 50 p, 50 pence that is. I think that&#39;s about 1 dollar, and you go in there and everything is 100 yen. You can buy all sorts of things in a 100 yen shop. You can buy food. You can buy things for your house, things for your bathroom, your kitchen. You can buy ornaments and stationary and things like shampoo. I really, really like to get a bargain and when I go in and I know that I&#39;ve found something and it&#39;s worth buying, I really, really get excited about it, and it sends shivers down my spine. We have a shop in Britain and it&#39;s quite similar to the 100 yen shop. It&#39;s called Pound Land and so everything in it is 1 pound. Not everything is a real bargain.

   Some things are really pretty rubbish but if you do find a bargain, it&#39;s great. It reminds me really of what we have in Britain called car boot sales. They are places where people go and they fill their cars full of things that they don&#39;t want anymore and they sell them and people look through other people&#39;s items and they find the things that they want to buy and they barter, so they try and get things for a cheap price. It&#39;s really good though when you get a bargain. How do you feel about that?

  Todd:
 </strong>
 Now, I thought we would talk a little bit about your country. First of all, about shopping, what is shopping like in Sri Lanka?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   The basic difference
  </span>
  of shopping in Sri Lanka is that you can bargain, like most of the places you can bargain, so if you and talk to the seller like very friendly and saying that you don&#39;t have that much money, you only have this much money, and then he will of course reduce the price for you.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty cool. So, does this only apply to shopping for food or shopping for clothing or is it for everything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s for everything, even for jewelry, furniture, everything you can bargain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now are things, most things in Sri Lanka much cheaper than they are in Japan or the United States?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Of course, it&#39;s very much cheaper.When I come here and see and it&#39;s like half the price.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, half the price.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Yeah, most of it. For example, if it&#39;s like a 100 yen here, the thing in Sri Lanka will be like maybe ten yen, twenty yen, so it&#39;s like very cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. That is a big difference. Only twenty percent of the original cost.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  But on the other hand, the salary that we receive is quite lower than the salary that you receive in Japan, so maybe in terms of Sri Lankan people it&#39;s expensive but for me, when I see
  <span class="audionotes">
   from this perspective
  </span>
  it&#39;s very cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so if you buy a shirt, like a nice cotton shirt in Sri Lanka, how much would that cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Around a 100
  <span class="audionotes">
   rupees
  </span>
  in terms of yen, and it will be around 150 yen, 200 yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That is cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s very cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and how about if you want to buy a nice suit, you want to buy slacks and a jacket and a tie and a dress shirt, how much would that cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  If you want to order it
  <span class="audionotes">
   order-made
  </span>
  , it will be around 5,000 yen, around 4,000 rupees, but if it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   just like
  </span>
  the suit in the shop, it&#39;s more cheaper than that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Even cheaper.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Yeah, around 4,000 yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, 4,000 yen. Now, 4,000 yen is how much in rupees?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  3,500, 3,200 rupees around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think in dollars that would be about 35 dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s very cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s really cheap.
