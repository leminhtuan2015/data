  Mike:
 </strong>
 So we&#39;re talking about ideal hotels. What do you think is an ideal hotel for you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a tough question but when I choose a hotel I would look at where the hotel&#39;s located.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  And also the food. So as long as the hotel is surrounded by nature, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   preferably
  </span>
  on the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  And maybe some mountains in the back and if the food, the breakfast and dinner and all the food that they have is amazing, I&#39;m good,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m set
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Now what about facilities? I mean, you know, hotels have various facilities whether it&#39;s gyms or movie rooms or computer rooms that allow you to do, you know, internet and various things. You know some hotels have pools. Would those be things that you would want in your ideal hotel?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah. Gym, I&#39;m not so interested in because I can, you know, play sports outside when I&#39;m surrounded by nature. Why would I be, you know, inside working out?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  But in terms of swimming pool, I&#39;m actually interested because when I was looking at pictures, I don&#39;t know which country it was, but there&#39;s an outdoor pool, infinity pool, that looked like it was connected to the ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  And it was just so beautiful and, you know, before I thought why would I swim in the swimming pool when I have an ocean in front of me but, you know, if there is a swimming pool like that at the hotel, I would definitely stay there for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Right. Now what about spa facilities? You know, massages and different spa treatments. Is that something that would interest you in your ideal hotel?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Oh, yes, yes, for sure. I&#39;m so into massages and yeah, I would definitely want massage room and spas in the hotel. That would be perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  OK. And, you know, there are some really expensive hotels that offer the service of a
  <span class="audionotes">
   personal butler
  </span>
  . Do you think that would be necessary for you in your ideal hotel or would that be one
  <span class="audionotes">
   amenity
  </span>
  that you could do without?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  I think it depends but I don&#39;t really, when I&#39;m staying at the hotel I would usually, you know, want to be alone and want to enjoy my time with my family or my, you know, my husband or myself that I actually don&#39;t want anyone following me everywhere I go. So, you know, to a lot of people it might be that&#39;s a good idea, you know, it&#39;s a nice treat to have but I am personally
  <span class="audionotes">
   not up for
  </span>
  that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  OK, well it sounds like a pretty nice hotel you&#39;ve just described.
