   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So, what&#39;s your favorite thing to do in the winter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  My favorite thing to do in the winter is probably to go skiing. As I said before, forty-five minutes from Montreal is a great ski resort called St. Sauveur. You
  <span class="audionotes">
   go up there
  </span>
  for the day, dressed warmly of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably you leave your house around seven-thirty in the morning. Get up there by eight-thirty. Go skiing all day. And while you are going skiing you
  <span class="audionotes">
   take breaks
  </span>
  to go into the lodge where you get hot chocolate or poutine. So, many people don&#39;t know what poutine is. Let me explain. Poutine is french fries with cheese and gravy all mixed together so when it&#39;s cold outside and you&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   dying for
  </span>
  something warm and maybe carb-heavy because you&#39;re doing so much exercise skiing, I allow myself a little poutine
  <span class="audionotes">
   treat
  </span>
  where I go into the lodge and, you know, get my poutine. Many people don&#39;t like it. Many people think it&#39;s kind of strange. Normally those people are people who aren&#39;t born in Quebec or aren&#39;t Canadian, but once you acquire the taste for poutine it&#39;s difficult not to order it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Well, I really like sweets in the winter when I&#39;m cold. For some reason I crave sweets, so is there anything that I would like to eat in the winter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  Yes! Because of the French influence in Montreal there are great crepes so another popular thing to do for apres-ski, which is
  <em>
   after skiing
  </em>
  , is to go to a creperie where you get a big bowl of french onion soup
  <span class="audionotes">
   dripping with
  </span>
  cheese and for desert you&#39;ll have a crepe, you know, with chocolate in it or bananas. There is something to satisfy all tastes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Sounds fantastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s wonderful.
