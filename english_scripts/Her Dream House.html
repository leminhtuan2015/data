   Curtis
  </strong>
  : All right. So Spencer if you could design your dream home, what would it be like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Spencer
  </strong>
  : I know exactly what it would be like. It would be all wood, old-style beach house on the ocean and on the sand. So it would have ocean front porches all the way around. The biggest thing is the porches because I don&#39;t really care about having, you know, massive extra rooms for guests or whatever like I want to be able to be outside. Like being outside
  <span class="audionotes">
   is big for me
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I love screened-in porches as well. So that and a library. I&#39;m a huge kind of book nerd, so I would love to have just a library with lots of different shelves and, you know, a couple of desks for studying. That&#39;s the dream home for me. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Curtis
  </strong>
  : Actually, I&#39;m wondering about the outside. Would you paint the house or would you just leave it the natural wood color?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Spencer
  </strong>
  : I want a natural color. There&#39;s an island south that&#39;s all kind of pastel Easter egg looking colors and it&#39;s too much for me. Also too like all the beach houses in LA, they&#39;re all kind of too tacky for me. Like I don&#39;t know. I like kind of the old look kind of traditional style.

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Curtis
  </strong>
  : Do you think you would use natural wood on it or a different material? I know that the beaches are really tough on the
  <span class="audionotes">
   siding and paneling
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Spencer
  </strong>
  : That is true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Curtis
  </strong>
  : Okay. What would th e kitchen be like in your dream house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Spencer
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m not much of a cook but I hope that my future husband is. So I would like to have a big kitchen for him. Lots of table space. I want one of those islands, you know, in the center of a kitchen where there&#39;s a marble countertop that has, you know, a couple of sinks and the ability to kind of put multiple different parts of vegetables or fruits out and about while you&#39;re cooking and preparing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yeah. I&#39;d also like kind of a bar counter space as well so that people kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   pull up a chair
  </span>
  and maybe help cook or maybe just be there for company while you&#39;re cooking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Curtis
  </strong>
  : And how about your living room, do you have any ideas for that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Spencer
  </strong>
  : Living room mainly just comfort. My parents had a living room in their house but it was all just really nice antique furniture and we were never allowed to go there. So it&#39;s kind of like what&#39;s the point of having a room in a house that you never go into?
 </p>
 <p>
  So I would like a living room, yes, maybe with a fireplace and some antique furniture but nothing too nice that, you know, my child or my dog were to come in from outside could really like
  <span class="audionotes">
   mess up
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Curtis
  </strong>
  : And how about your yard, do you have any ideas for a yard around your house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Spencer
  </strong>
  : I want a lot of dogs. So I would like a big yard that they could be able to run around in, as well as if I have children, like have enough room for them to be able to, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   slip and slide
  </span>
  . So, you know, one of my best friends back home she had a yard that had a creek in it. And that was so much fun like growing up being able to like catch different, you know, creepy-crawlies in the stream as well as have a messy or muddy day if we wanted to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Curtis
  </strong>
  : And how about the bathroom?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Spencer
  </strong>
  : I want a massive bathroom actually. You know, my favorite shower in the world has like five or six different faucets and it&#39;s just massive. That gives you space. I&#39;m kind of a clumsy person, so if I fall down I don&#39;t want to be able to, you know â€“ I don&#39;t want to hit my head on anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also like a big Jacuzzi bathtub. My grandparents have this really, really, big old
  <span class="audionotes">
   porcelain
  </span>
  tub that I swear like five people could fit into. So I&#39;d really like to be able to have a big bathtub.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Curtis
  </strong>
  : Okay. Thank you.
