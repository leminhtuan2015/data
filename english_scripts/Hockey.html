   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Steve you were saying that you&#39;re a big hockey fan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steve:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. I love hockey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Why? What is it about hockey?
 </p>

   Steve:
  </strong>
  Well, hockey is a really exciting sport. It&#39;s played on the ice. It&#39;s really fast. It&#39;s aggressive. Also, it requires a lot of skill. It&#39;s a really good sport for spectators to watch because there&#39;s lots of action. You can watch it at home with friends. Drink beer, eat pizza, and have a really good time. I also like it because I&#39;m Canadian and it&#39;s Canada&#39;s national sport, and Canada is the best hockey team in the world right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now Canada has the best hockey team.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steve:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. We won the gold medal. We won the world championship. Both the men&#39;s and the women&#39;s teams.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s pretty cool. In hockey, how long is the game?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steve:
  </strong>
  The game is three twenty minute periods, but because of stoppages in play , it usually takes about two and a half hours for a whole game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK, and did you play in high school when you were younger?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steve:
  </strong>
  Ah, no, I&#39;m not that good a skater. You have to be a really good skater, but I played street hockey and floor hockey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what&#39;s the difference between street hockey and ice hockey?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steve:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s pretty much the same thing. Street hockey you play on the road or on a tennis court and instead of using a puck you use a hockey ball or a tennis ball.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and do you run or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steve:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you run.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, you run!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steve:
  </strong>
  Yeah. It&#39;s pretty well the same game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, alright, thanks Steve.
 </p>
