  Todd:
 </strong>
 OK, Richard!
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Hi, Todd. Good to see you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Good to see you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Long time no see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s been awhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s been awhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Richard, you helped me out when I first started the website.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  My pleasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you&#39;re very kind and you talked about your dog!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Lucky!
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Here he is! This is Lucky&#39;s picture.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s big. So tell us about Lucky. How&#39;s lucky been the last two years?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Lucky, the last two year! Yeah! Lucky is almost two years old. His birthday is November the 11th! One-One-One-One, so he&#39;ll be 2 years old. He&#39;s doing well. He&#39;s developed some unique, sort of characteristics, personality traits. One is that late at night he doesn&#39;t like walking just with me, it has to be with me and my wife together. So he has two big bodyguards. It&#39;s true. It&#39;s an unusual thing but he will not walk by the river where it&#39;s very dark with just one person. He needs two people to walk him. Which is unusual for a dog. He&#39;s a golden retriever so he&#39;s a big dog, but he&#39;s just, he needs two people and he gets very lonely, you know he likes to follow people around the house the whole time, you know he&#39;s a really, he&#39;s a very sort of sociable dog.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What a lovely dog?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Yes, lovely dog!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I want to meet him!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, anytime!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, I think you were saying something earlier about how he gets cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s the other thing. One of the other unique things about Lucky is that I think he&#39;s a but spoiled. I mean, you know, a lot of dogs live outdoors but this dog lives indoors, and you know the kotatsu, in the winter my obaachan, my wife&#39;s mother has the kotatsu.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, like the kotatsu is like a big blanket.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Ah, yeah, like a little low table.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, the kotatsu, oh, yeah, yeah, sorry
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  An electric heater underneath it
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s right, sorry!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  And cat in Japan, cats are famous for going under the kotatsu in winter but my dog goes under the Kotatsu, so and he&#39;s quite big right, so you just see his legs poking out of the kotatsu. I mean that&#39;s a very unusual behavior for a golden retriever. Yeah, yeah, he&#39;s and unusual dog.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how much does he eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  I see, what about my son. I want to talk about my son.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, no but like, first I&#39;m just curious, how much does you dog eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  How much does he eat? Well, it&#39;s three times a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I mean, how much does it cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Oh, the cost!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, to feed a dog in Japan!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  Well, that&#39;s a good, that&#39;s a tough question. I buy a big bag of food. It costs me 18,000 yen and that lasts about three months, so about 6,000 yen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man, that is expensive! So you&#39;re dog, that&#39;s at least 6,000 yen a month on food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  And then Vet&#39;s bills are pretty high.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! But he&#39;s worth it! It seems like you love your dog.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  I love my dog. I carry his picture everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s my favorite dog too! Golden Retrievers. They&#39;re so kind.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Richard:
  </strong>
  I also love my son! Can I talk about my son!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, we&#39;ll do your son in the next interview.
