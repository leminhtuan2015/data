  : Hey Hana, how are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : I’m fine, thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : So tell me, you lived in London, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well, I’m planning to go to London and I’m really
  <span class="audionotes">
   looking forward to
  </span>
  it. But I’m not really
  <span class="audionotes">
   sure
  </span>
  and I don’t really know
  <span class="audionotes">
   what to expect
  </span>
  and what I can see there, can you tell me a little bit, please?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yeah, sure. London is a very interesting place. It’s a place where a lot of cultures are mixed. There are lots of historical buildings, for example, Buckingham Palace and Big Ben. There is a very famous museum called the British Museum. And a lot of people come and visit every year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : That’s really good because I’m really interested in history and I really want to see history there. But is there any other thing that I should see in London or I should try in London, for example, is there any good local British food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Well, England isn’t very famous for food, but it is famous because a lot of food from different countries is all
  <span class="audionotes">
   gathered
  </span>
  . For example, there’s a very good place called The Camden Market and you can go and buy food from
  <span class="audionotes">
   all over
  </span>
  the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Good, that sounds really interesting, really looking forward to it. Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : You’re welcome.
