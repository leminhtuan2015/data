   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nicola, you&#39;re from England.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Yes, I am.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Now in England you have something called &#34;Boxing day&#34;.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Yes, we do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, we don&#39;t have that in America. What is Boxing day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Well, boxing day is always on the 26th of December, the day after Christmas day, and it was originally called boxing day because it was the day in England when the very rich people in Victorian times gave presents to their servants, the day after Christmas, and usually it would be something like money, or food but they would give it to them in a small box, and so on December the 26th, servants would receive their boxes,the Christmas boxes, and that&#39;s why it was called Boxing day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Today, people don&#39;t really receive money or food so much, sometimes you give extra tips at Christmas, but Boxing day has stuck. So that&#39;s the name.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do people do on Boxing day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Nothing really. Uh, eat the leftover turkey, turkey sandwiches, watch TV, and in my family we usually go and watch dog racing, grey hound racing. Yeah, and lose some money...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Lose money!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Yeah always. At least I do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, cool. Dog track. Is there a dog track near your house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nicola:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there is, where I live, yeah.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Mark, what happens on boxing day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  On boxing day in England it&#39;s usually football day. Everybody goes and watches the football. Usually all the family go, so maybe granddad and grandma will go. In England on Boxing day, it&#39;s usually the highest attendances of the year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so we wake up on boxing day around about 11 o&#39;clock, usually with a big hangover because we&#39;ve been drinking of Christmas
  <br>
  day, and so to get rid of the hangover, what do we do, we actually drink more alcohol, so we usually go to the bar around 11, drink a lot of beer, and then go the football around about 2 and watch the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s it like at the stadium?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Usually a really good atmosphere on boxing day, because, yeah and there are really big crowds and everybody is really happy cause it&#39;s Christmas so usually there&#39;s some guys dressed as Santa Clause or people are wearing like Christmas decorations and it&#39;s a really good atmosphere.
