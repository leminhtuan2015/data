    Todd:
   </strong>
   So, Shuan, you talked about being on a cruise and going to Key West. Were there any other places that you remember that were really good on your trip?

   Yeah, we ended up in Cancun for two days, and I have a really interesting story that I probably
   <span class="audionotes">
    shouldn&#39;t tell
   </span>
   , but I will anyway. Well, the first day it was just normal, pretty much shopping and we
   <span class="audionotes">
    checked out
   </span>
   the local sites and stuff and went to a Mayan, an old Mayan temple (nice) and it was kind of scary. They told us that they had
   <span class="audionotes">
    human sacrifices
   </span>
   and everything there so.

   </strong>
   Ooh, gory.
   <br>

   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   <span class="audionotes">
    It was kind of creepy
   </span>
   but.
  </font>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   On the second day, we went snorkeling and
   <span class="audionotes">
    we lost track of time
   </span>
   . The bus dropped us off at around 12 o&#39;clock and we were supposed to meet back at the bus at around 4 o&#39;clock. Unfortunately for me and my friend, we didn&#39;t have watches, so we went snorkeling, and while we were snorkeling we found these underwater tunnels which were just filled with fish and coral and we basically lost track of time and we went swimming through all of them, and, or yeah, another story about that is we actually saw a sea lion.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, really.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   A sea lion, yeah. It just came right up next to us so we added that and.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   It let you touch it?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   It let us touch it, yeah.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   That is cool.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   We swam around with the sea lion for a little bit. And then we headed back, cause we thought it was around 3 o&#39;clock, but unfortunately it was 4:30 and the bus had already left.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, no.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   So we had to rent a taxi, and I would say that taxi drivers in Mexico are probably the most dangerous taxi drivers ever. On the way back, I noticed that his speedometer wasn&#39;t working, and we must have been going around a 130 kilometers per hour down this road. It was only a two lane road. One way for one-way traffic, and one way for the other way traffic, but he was driving on the shoulder of the lane we wanted to get on so he was passing trucks and cars and motorbikes, just all on the shoulder and he basically drove 130 kilometers per hour, right down the side of the road.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   And we got to the ferry terminal where we were supposed to catch the ferry back to the cruise ship, or back to another island which the cruise ship was parked at we actually missed the ferry by three minutes.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh!
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Yeah, so they told us that the next ferry would be three hours later and we just couldn&#39;t afford to wait because our ship was going to leave, so we couldn&#39;t think of anything else but to charter an airplane. So this is all on my dad&#39;s credit card, mind you, so we chartered an airplane and we flew to the island which was about a ten minutes flight, not that long, but it ended up costing us 500 U.S. dollars
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, man.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   And that was just to get back to the cruise ship, and it was just the worst time I&#39;ve ever spent there.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, man, what a story. Well, what did you dad say about the credit card bill?
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Um, I got billed for it a few months later.
