A rare bipartisan commitment between the White House and Congress to make sweeping changes on infrastructure dramatically collapsed on Wednesday.
<br><br>
As AP's Sagar Meghani reports, President Donald Trump abruptly walked out of a meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer after Pelosi said that Trump was involved in a coverup.
<br><br>
It lasted all of three minutes.  "To watch what happened in the White House would make your jaw drop."  "It was very, very, very strange."
<br><br>
Sources say President Trump walked in, told Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi there would be no negotiating while Democrats investigate him, and then walked into the Rose Garden, where reporters who'd been urgently summoned to minutes earlier waited.
<br><br>
"Let them play their games."
<br><br>
He's furious over Pelosi saying hours earlier he'd engaged in a Russia probe coverup.
<br><br>
The Democrats, though, say it was all staged in excuse not to talk about infrastructure.
<br><br>
"He had to run away."
<br><br>

A federal judge has ruled that President Trump and his family must turn over bank records from two of Trump's major lenders.  Deutsche Bank and Capitol One clearing the way for banks to comply with congressional subpoenas.
<br><br>
We get details from AP's Mike Gracia.
<br><br>
U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos has refused to block subpoenas from two House panels seeking financial records from two banks that did business with President Donald Trump.
<br><br>
Trump and his company filed a lawsuit arguing the subpoenas from the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees were unlawful and unconstitutional.  But in a ruling delivered from the bench in New York, Ramos concluded the subpoenas have legitimate legislative purpose.
<br><br>
Lawyers for the two committees say they need the documents from Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to investigate possible foreign influence on the U.S. political process.

A months-long investigation has failed to determine if Virginia Governor Ralph Northam is one of two men featured in a racist photo that appeared in his 1984 medical school yearbook.
<br><br>
AP's Ed Donahue has details.
<br><br>
The photo is of a man in black face next to someone in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe.
<br><br>
"We have identified no information that the photograph was placed on Governor Northam's personal page in error or by any other means not at his direction."
<br><br>
Ben Hatch's law firm hired by Eastern Virginia Medical School conducted the investigation.
<br><br>
"We could not conclusively determine the origin of that photograph."
<br><br>
Northam initially acknowledged he was in the picture and apologized but later said he was convinced he was not in the picture.
<br><br>
The governor has managed to survive the uproar.  He has defied calls to resign.

Supporters of the opposition candidate, Prabowo Subianto, were met with tear gas on Wednesday.  They threw fireworks and debris in return.

An election supervisory agency said there was a lack of evidence to support claims of systematic cheating and independent observers have said the poll was free and fair.
