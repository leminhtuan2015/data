  Tom:
 </strong>
 Jess, you were talking before about getting your hair done.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jess:
  </strong>
  Every month, I have my hair done. Well, every four to six weeks I have my hair done. I have highlights which is one color. They take
  <span class="audionotes">
   small strands
  </span>
  of the hair and color that so overall it looks like it&#39;s more sunkissed, like it&#39;s bleached in the sun. But then I also get a low-light put through it, which is less harmful to the hair and gives more volume to the color if you have two colors, and that takes a long time to do. They wrap the hair they&#39;re going to color in foil and it takes about half an hour for it to take effect and during that time they put a big ... I don&#39;t know how to describe it really. It&#39;s like a big helmut which releases hot air onto your hair, which speed up the process of the coloring, so it&#39;s quite long and
  <span class="audionotes">
   drawn out
  </span>
  . I usually get through two or three magazines while that&#39;s happening. And then they wash out all of the color, and I have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   treatment
  </span>
  to protect the hair because the color often makes it dry, so the colors kinds of ... the treatments
  <span class="audionotes">
   nourishing
  </span>
  and
  <span class="audionotes">
   moisturizing
  </span>
  and they leave that on for about twenty minutes again so usually I fall asleep
  <span class="redhighlight">
   at that point
  </span>
  , and then they&#39;ll rinse your hair and then cut it and style it so anything between two and a half and four hours, so much more complex and longer than you&#39;re
  <span class="redhighlight">
   half-an-hour short-back and sides
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Yeah, I have a whole monthly beauty regime. I also go and get my nails done and I have a manicure and a pedicure simultaneously to save time. And I love that. It always feels decedent to have one person working on your hands and another scrubbing away at your feet, and sometimes I&#39;ll have like a matching polish which always makes me feel good. What else do I have done every month? I try to go for a massage and a facial once a month. At the moment, I&#39;m doing like a workout regime so I&#39;m working out every day, so my muscles are aching a lot, especially when I stand up and sit down, so I&#39;m going for special ... what&#39;s the word ...
  <span class="redhighlight">
   ayurvedic
  </span>
  . I&#39;m not sure what the right word is: special massage where they really push down on your muscles and then I have a facial afterwards. Yeah, I think that&#39;s about it. I think that&#39;s enough, no!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="redhighlight">
   I don&#39;t envy all that time you spend
  </span>
  ! But you do look great.
