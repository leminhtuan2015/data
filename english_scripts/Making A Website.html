  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Mark you said that you want to build a website.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. Yeah. So I noticed that you have a website, Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Did you build that yourself?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I did actually. I knew nothing when I first started and I learned and it&#39;s pretty easy actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Really, I was looking at the program called Dreamweaver. Do you now that one?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually, Dreamweaver is probably the most popular program.
  <span class="audionotes">
   It&#39;s what I use
  </span>
  . It&#39;s quite good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so you use that to build your website.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  OK, cause
  <span class="audionotes">
   I actually managed to build
  </span>
  a website. I was building one for my Auntie&#39;s small hotel in Spain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah. And I managed to build it - about four pages, but I was having problems actually putting it on the internet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Have you any advice for me? She didn&#39;t want to pay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. She wanted to do it for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  For free, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, usually you can get website for free but what will happen is they&#39;ll put a banner or they&#39;ll put some type of advertisement for that company on the website, so it&#39;s pretty hard to get free server space without some type of advertisement unless you pay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right. So how much does it cost per month to put your website on the internet?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I only pay $40 dollars a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  $40 dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and I get
  <span class="audionotes">
   quite a bit of bandwidth
  </span>
  . I only use half of my bandwidth so it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a really good set up
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  And then you have... Is there a way to keep track of how many people hit your website per day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so actually a hit usually just refers to like the computer pulling up a picture or a text or an audio. A unique viewer is how many people view the website, so usually the company will tell you how many unique viewers you have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And also if you want to make money on advertising,
  <span class="audionotes">
   the key thing is
  </span>
  unique viewers and also pages, page impressions, which means how many different pages are pulled up on the screen, so that&#39;s what advertisers want to know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right. OK.
 </p>
