    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So, Akane, tell me about your family. Who do you get on well with in your family?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well, I think I get along the best with my mother, I would say.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So, why is that?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well, I think it probably has to do with the fact that we&#39;re both female. I mean the only other
   <br>
   people in my family are my father and my brother.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So, what does your mom look like?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well, she&#39;s actually taller than me. She has dark hair and a pretty firm build.
   <br>
   Um, she&#39;s not too thin and not too fat, and yeah!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   And what does you mom do? Does she have a job?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Oh, good question. She&#39;s actually a hair dresser. (Wow) Yeah, so she does my hair and
   <br>
   she&#39;s also an aesthetician as well so I get free skin care products from her.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Oh, that&#39;s fantastic.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So what does your mom like to do when she is not working?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well, she used to take sewing lessons, so she really likes to sew things like her own curtains
   <br>
   and she even made me some clothes a few times.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Wow, so she&#39;s talented.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah, she&#39;s quite artistic.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   So when did you last see your mom or speak to your mom?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Well, the last time I saw her was this spring. I stayed at my parents house for about a week and,
   <br>
   yeah, that&#39;s when I saw her.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Was that a couple of months ago?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Yeah, a couple of months ago, that&#39;s right.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   And what was the last thing your mom bought for you?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Actually, just before I came here, we went shopping together and because I have to fly away
   <br>
   to a new country she bought me some new clothes. She bought me a new coat actually.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Ruth:
   </strong>
   Wow, that&#39;s really nice. Well, thanks for that Akane.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Akane:
   </strong>
   Thanks.
