  Jana
 </strong>
 : So we have homework, tests, what about attendance? Should we require students to attend classes or? Sometimes people argue at university level it shouldn&#39;t be
 <span class="audionotes">
  compulsory
 </span>
 .
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : I think you should attend some classes at least. You&#39;re going to university, you&#39;re paying for your education so you should attend some classes but it doesn&#39;t mean if you&#39;re not attending a class that you can still get the information and study by yourself too. That&#39;s why I like internet so much because I think people can get so much information from academic institutions
  <span class="audionotes">
   via
  </span>
  the internet, they don&#39;t have to attend a physical class.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s right and on the other hand you might attend physically but you&#39;re not really paying attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  :Exactly. You might as well sleep in class sometimes. It doesn&#39;t prove that you&#39;re learning if you&#39;re there. It depends on the person again I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : So maybe rather than strictly checking attendance, we should check what the students have learned?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : Yes, and how do you do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s right. Now we come back to that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : Testing? I don&#39;t know. I think there are other ways of finding out if students have learned things if they, you don&#39;t have to call things tests, you can set students tasks to find out if they can do the required
  <span class="audionotes">
   task
  </span>
  without calling it a test.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s right and then it becomes maybe a bit more practical too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : Yeah, yeah, I think so. I think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : Did you do a lot of projects when you were a student?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : Not so many and I think when I studied like education has quite changed in the last twenty years or so and I think people are doing more projects than they used to do when I was a student for the first time but I really like projects because I think it&#39;s putting your knowledge to work and finding out how you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   apply your knowledge
  </span>
  to make it practical and usable so I really like projects. I wish I could give my students more projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that&#39;s true. Maybe they&#39;ll be better than tests.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : I think so too, yeah. It&#39;s a better way to find out if people know things if you give them a project that involves what they&#39;ve studied.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : And in the real life they won&#39;t be taking tests any more. They need to be able to apply the knowledge, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : Exactly, yeah, exactly. Do you use projects a lot in your class?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : Not as much. As you know, we have quite a
  <span class="audionotes">
   strict
  </span>
  schedule so that we need to follow but like you I also didn&#39;t have a lot of projects in my school when I was growing up but yeah, I think it&#39;s definitely something to think about.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   tricky
  </span>
  to give a project in language, like making a language project. For example, I remember doing biology projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : Then you go out and you find information and you do research so you can find stuff but for doing, how do you do that for a language? Do you have any ideas?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s a very good question. Yeah, just to use the language, right? That&#39;s the main project isn&#39;t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I guess. See if you can use the language in different ways like for example.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana
  </strong>
  : There is some homework for us to think about.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter
  </strong>
  : I think so too. Yeah, let&#39;s think about that.
