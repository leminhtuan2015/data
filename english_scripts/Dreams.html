   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Hey Hana, you know, I had a horrible dream last night, horrible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Really, what is it about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well I can&#39;t tell you because it might become true so I&#39;m not going tell, I&#39;m just going to tell you I had a
  <span class="audionotes">
   horrible
  </span>
  dream, that&#39;s it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : No, no, you have to tell me like I heard that you have to tell otherwise that will come true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : No, no, it&#39;s the opposite, trust me. So, do you dream a lot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Ahm, well yes, I usually remember my dream every day but I forget it so I don&#39;t really remember it now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Oh because, you know, I&#39;ve been reading a lot about dreams because
  <span class="audionotes">
   lately
  </span>
  I&#39;ve been dreaming a lot and people said that you dream every single night but the difference is whether if you remember the dream or not, so do you know that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I read something similar to that. I heard that you dream seven dreams like seven different stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Seven?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yeah and you only remember the fourth and fifth dream.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Why is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t know, you only can remember the fourth or fifth so that&#39;s why sometimes when you have a dream, there are many different stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : So that means if what we read is true it&#39;s like we dream every night and every night we dream seven different stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yes and I heard it&#39;s good if you write your dreams down while you remember it and it&#39;s really interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yeah it is but even if you remember the dreams because that has happened to me, you wake up, you remember the dream but really quickly and really say you forget the dream. Has that happen to you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that happens to me a lot that&#39;s why I think really should
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep a diary
  </span>
  of my dreams because I heard a lot of things that you dream about can be
  <span class="audionotes">
   hints
  </span>
  for your life or what you&#39;re thinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Oh that&#39;s really interesting so well, I think I&#39;m going to get a notebook or something and keep it, you know, on my
  <span class="audionotes">
   bedside table
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yeah, me too.
