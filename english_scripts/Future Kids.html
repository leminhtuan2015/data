   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Simon, I was wondering you know, you have a newborn son and before you know it, he&#39;ll probably be 10 years old, 12 years old, and I wonder if his life will a lot different than it was for us when we were 10 or 12. Like for example, education, do you remember what school was like when you were 12.

   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sure I do. I think his education will be the same as mine. I don&#39;t think, like I had a classroom with maybe 15 or 20 students in it. He&#39;ll probably have a classroom with 15 or 20 students in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Of course there will be a lot more technology in his classroom. I mean, I remember my first computer had green and white, green and black screen. He&#39;ll probably have
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/645-1-3-deminsional.mp3">
   3-dimensional
  </a>
  shapes with his computer screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That will be amazing. What about sports? Do you think sports will be the same? That he&#39;ll play
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/645-2-pick-up-games.mp3">
   pick up games
  </a>
  with his friends and go to the park and play soccer, whatever.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Sure. The only difference is for example, I played soccer when I was young. I played on grass. He&#39;ll probably play on
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/645-3-artificial-turf.mp3">
   artificial turf
  </a>
  on the top of a building somewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Actually that kind of worried me about kids today. They don&#39;t play sports and freely as they did, you know, when I was 12. Cause when I was 12, we would always play pick-up basketball games or pick-up baseball games. I don&#39;t know if kids do that so much anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  I think they probably do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You think so. OK. Well what about entertainment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  I think some things never change so when he is 12 years old he will do exactly what I don&#39;t want him to do, which is exactly what I did so those things might be different, like I would probably
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/645-4-hang-out.mp3">
   hang out
  </a>
  with my friends and go skateboarding. He&#39;ll probably have a jet board instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A jet board. Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Well, who knows. I don&#39;t know, but something, something new.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right. OK, that&#39;s cool.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Anything else you think might be different for your son, especially when you son is 30, in his 30&#39;s like you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but I guess technology, I think technology and
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/645-5-over-population.mp3">
   overpopulation
  </a>
  so he&#39;ll probably see a lot less natural sites or won&#39;t be able to experience nature as I did. I mean even now I don&#39;t see as much nature as I did 20 years ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Yeah, it&#39;s kind of a sad thing. OK, anyway, thanks a lot Simon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, no problem.
