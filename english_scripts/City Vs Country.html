  Joel:
 </strong>
 So, Michele, you said you are from Canada.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  What part of Canada?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  I lived in Ontario in a small town called Beaverton.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Beaverton. And so how big is the town?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  It was pretty small, about seven or eight thousand people I think.

  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s pretty small.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Did you like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  I think when I was really little I liked it. It was nice to play outside with your friends and we always felt really safe. When I got older as a teenager, sometimes I thought it was pretty boring being in such a small town, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   I think overall
  </span>
  it was good to live in a small town.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  What would you do for fun when you were a teenager?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   there was actually a movie theater
  </span>
  in our small town so sometimes we&#39;d go to the theater but it wasn&#39;t a great one. We usually went outside of the town into the city to go shopping or see a movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  And so since then have you lived in any big cities?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve lived near Tokyo in Japan, so that&#39;s a pretty big city. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  So I guess you prefer that then... to your hometown?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Well, actually I felt that Tokyo was too big of a city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s the
  <span class="audionotes">
   opposite extreme
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s so crowded and the people aren&#39;t as friendly so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s probably a big difference between a small town and a big town, huh? Like you know practically everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  So, you walk into a store. You walk down the street, you can say &#39;hi&#39; to almost everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, actually, I&#39;ve also lived in a really small town in Japan too and I prefered the small town in Japan to the big city like Tokyo. The people in the small town knew my name and were very friendly. If I needed any help then because it&#39;s a small town, everybody knows everything about the things in the town so if I needed to find a place or if I wanted to join a club I could easily get the information in a small town,
  <span class="audionotes">
   whereas
  </span>
  in a big city people don&#39;t know the things as well, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  You also have to be careful what you do because everyone will talk.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  You can&#39;t hide.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  In a small town, you don&#39;t have as much privacy but I think
  <span class="audionotes">
   the friendliness outweighs the privacy issues.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  OK, thanks Michele.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Michele:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
 </p>
