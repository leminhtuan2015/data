   Shantel
  </strong>
  : So Todd, you live in Japan. Do you see your family often?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yes. I see them often. I see them usually once a year, but I write to them often, and I call them sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : Okay. And when you see them, do you go to the United States to visit them, or do they come to Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I go to America, and then everyone goes to my mom&#39;s house, and everybody meets me at my mom&#39;s house, which is nice. I see my sister, and we talk a lot, and it&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : Does your mother miss you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yes. She misses me and I miss her a lot, so it&#39;s very nice to see her, and also, I miss my dad. I miss him a lot, so I&#39;m always happy to see him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : Nice. What about your sister? When you&#39;re in the United States, do you have some activities you like to do together?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, sometimes we do stuff together. Maybe I will meet her at a caf√©, or I will go shopping with her, so we do something fun each time I go back.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  :  Nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Also, when I go home, I see my best friend, and that&#39;s always nice. I usually meet him for dinner, and of course I call him, and it&#39;s always nice to see my best friend. How about your family?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : Well, since I live in Japan, I also call them and write them, but usually, we only Skype about once a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh. So, who do you Skype with the most, your mom or your dad?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : I Skype the most with my father, because he wakes up very early, so his time and his schedule match my schedule, so it is easy for us to Skype.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you call him or does he call you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : I usually call him, but sometimes he calls me. Usually, if he calls me, it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t called in a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Uh-oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : Mm-hmm (affirmative).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So sometimes, you make him mad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : A little angry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right. That&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : But-
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You have a brother too, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : I do have a brother, and I call him less frequently, because he is so busy with his job, so we speak about once or twice a month, by messages or by phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s nice. Do you follow your family on social media?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : Yes. I use Facebook.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, I use it too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : It is a really easy way to keep in contact with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I agree. What about other social media? Do you use Twitter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : No. I don&#39;t use Twitter, and I don&#39;t use other social media either, only Facebook.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ah, that&#39;s good, I think. Too much is too bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : I agree, but I do love Facebook, because I can speak with my brother, and my mother, and my father anytime.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So, with Facebook, do you check it every day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : I do check it every day. Maybe it&#39;s a bad habit, but I do like to check it every day. Do you check your Facebook every day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Not every day. I check it maybe three times a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shantel
  </strong>
  : hree times a week?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I don&#39;t use it much, and I don&#39;t use it on my phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shantel: Oh. That&#39;s a good idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Todd: Yeah. I like my free time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shantel: Do you use other social media, such as Twitter or Instagram?
 </p>
 <p>
  Todd: I do use Twitter, but I don&#39;t use it on my phone. I only use it on the computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shantel: Okay. What about Instagram?
 </p>
 <p>
  Todd: Oh, I don&#39;t use it at all. Do you use it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Shantel: No, I don&#39;t use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Todd: Oh, that&#39;s right. You only use Facebook.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shantel: I only use Facebook.
 </p>
 <p>
  Todd: Oh, interesting. Well, that&#39;s nice that we can talk to our family on Skype and Facebook, because Japan is so far from America.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shantel: Yes, and I think they are very happy too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Todd: Yeah, I think they are happy.
