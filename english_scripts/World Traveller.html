   Todd:
  </strong>
  Tennessee?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  We&#39;re gonna talk about sports.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  OK. I&#39;m not
  <span class="audionotes">
   big on
  </span>
  sports but..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Well, that&#39;s OK. So you don&#39;t like sports?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  Well, I like sports but I&#39;m just not an
  <span class="audionotes">
   avid sports watcher
  </span>
  . You know I would usually rather watch a movie or some kind of history program.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. So you&#39;re into history.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  Oh, yes!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What kind of history?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a kind of a difficult question. I would say I&#39;m interested-- primarily, I&#39;m interested in ancient and medieval but I also like studying the history of the countries that I visit it makes it more interesting when I go
  <span class="audionotes">
   sight-seeing
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What countries have you visited?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve been to 26 countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Yeah, you can&#39;t name them all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  The big ones I would say, I&#39;ve been over a good bit of Europe,  Mexico, Peru.. I spent almost a year in Egypt and I went to Isreal, Jordan and now I&#39;m here in Japan. I&#39;ve been here in Japan  a year and a half. And while I have been here, I visited Korea for about a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Wow! That&#39;s a lot so did you do the Pyramids in Egypt?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  Oh, yes. Actually, I climbed the pyramids.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really? Nice. What&#39;s it like on the top?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  Very, very interesting. You can see-- it was during the summer so the
  <span class="audionotes">
   visibility was rather low
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  But, to see we were on The Great Pyramid and the second Pyramid Kefron was right nearby and it is a very different perspective to
  <span class="audionotes">
   see it from.
  </span>
  Very interesting to be eye-level, to be on the same level as the top of that second pyramid.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Wow! So you were in Peru, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What&#39;s the big thing people see in Peru?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  <em>
   Machu Pichu.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <em>
   Machu Pichu
  </em>
  . OK. What is
  <em>
   Machu Pichu
  </em>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  <em>
   Machu Pichu
  </em>
  is the ruins of a city that was built by the Inca People.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  Maybe over six hundred years ago and was lost, no one knew what happened to it until it was recently discovered about a hundred years ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Wow. Nice. All right, thanks a lot David.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tenn:
  </strong>
  Sure!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Or Tennessee.
