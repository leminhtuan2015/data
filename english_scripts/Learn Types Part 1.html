  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Julia, we&#39;re both teachers.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And are you familier with the different learner types?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  A little bit, yes, I
  <span class="audionotes">
   encounter
  </span>
  different kinds of learners in my classrooms.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so for example, what kind of learner are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I think possibly more than one, maybe overlap on a couple, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   primarily
  </span>
  a visual learner so I&#39;d have to take it in through my eyes usually like with a picture. I certainly have to see a word if I&#39;m learning a language. I have to see it written down.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you need a
  <span class="audionotes">
   phonetic
  </span>
  <span class="audionotes">
   script
  </span>
  ? You need something?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I need something visual.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah for it to stick in your head?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  For it to stay in my mind, it has to have a visual. I can&#39;t just hear it for example. I can&#39;t just hear a word and remember it. I have to have some sort of visual to connect it to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so you&#39;re a
  <span class="audionotes">
   visual learner
  </span>
  , anything else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s called a visual learner. I don&#39;t know the technical term for it but an emotional learner if a...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah. If a piece of information or the thing that I&#39;m learning is attached to an emotional experience, I store it very definitively. I can remember it. I can
  <span class="audionotes">
   recall
  </span>
  it. If it&#39;s just a neutral, say a sentence, I can&#39;t remember it. It has to have a back story. It has to have an emotional connection somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. It has to have some connection?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yes, yeah. Usually a personal story especially humor. If there&#39;s a joke involved, if it made me laugh at the time of learning it. I&#39;m a laughter learner, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a real one but definitely an emotional response makes it much more easy for me to learn something.
