   Adrienne
  </strong>
  : So, Lisa, you&#39;re Canadian, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  I am. I&#39;m
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    a very proud Canadian
   </span>
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  And, I believe you&#39;re from Montreal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  I am.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Can you tell me a little about your hometown?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  Sure. Montreal is a big city
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    for Canadian standards
   </span>
  </span>
  located in Eastern Canada. It is in the province of Quebec, which is one of the biggest provinces in Canada. It has a population, or Montreal has a population, of three million people and it is a city that was founded by the French and has always
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    maintained its French roots
   </span>
  </span>
  , so that in Montreal today, it is
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    a perfect blend
   </span>
  </span>
  of European French influences with English speaking from the rest of Canada culture, so in Quebec people are
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    bilingual
   </span>
  </span>
  ; they speak English and French, and you can, when you go traveling in Montreal, and you speak to someone first in English, they will reply to you in English, or if you start a conversation in French they will reply to you in French.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, very interestingâ€¦. Well, what&#39;s interesting to do in Montreal?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  Montreal is just so fabulous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Let&#39;s talk about daytime. What can you do during the day in Montreal?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not only about daytime, but also what season we&#39;re talking about, so let&#39;s start off with summer first, because summer in Montreal is probably the nicest season to go. Starting with festivals that happen in Montreal, there are three major festivals where we get people from all over the world coming into the city. The first festival is called
  <em>
   Juste pour rire
  </em>
  , which is &#34;just for laughs&#34;. It&#39;s a comedy festival. It started in Montreal and has now attracted talent from all over the world. There are comedy shows going on. There&#39;s also outdoor events, and you can sometimes see that
  <em>
   Juste pour rire
  </em>
  or just for laughs videos, when you&#39;re riding in airplanes. They have it before movies come on. There&#39;s also the Jazz festival where all over downtown Montreal you have Jazz, free jazz concerts or paid jazz concerts in all the different areas, all the different stadiums or concert halls and so the summer.
