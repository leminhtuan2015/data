   Todd
  </strong>
  : So Meg, thanks so much for helping me clean my house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : You&#39;re welcome. No problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s terrible when you have so much to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah. For example, tomorrow, I really have a lot to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh no, really? What? What do you have to do tomorrow?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Well first, I have a lot of laundry that I need to do. So I&#39;ll need to wash my clothes. After I wash my clothes, I&#39;ll need to iron my clothes, of course. And then finally, after I iron my clothes, I need to hang up all the clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, yeah. That&#39;s terrible. Yeah. Actually, I never iron my clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Really? Why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I always put my clothes in the dryer and they, you know, come out and they&#39;re okay. and I just hang them as soon as my clothes get out of the dryer. So I never iron my shirts. And sometimes, I take things to the dry cleaners so I don&#39;t have to iron.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes, that&#39;s something I also have to do is drop off a few dresses at the dry cleaners, some formal clothes. I need to take them to the dry cleaner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh really? Well, wait. How about this? You helped me clean my house, so I want to help you. So I can take your clothes to the dry cleaners.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Really? Is it okay?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. No problem. Actually, it&#39;s easy because I need to return some movies. So when I go to return my movies, I can drop off your clothes at the dry cleaners.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hey, while you&#39;re going to the dry cleaners, can you mail some letters for me?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. No problem. That&#39;s easy because the post office is really close to the dry cleaners.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh that&#39;s great. That will save me time because I need to go buy groceries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh yeah? Where do you buy your groceries?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I usually buy my groceries at Maxx Value, a grocery store.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. Yeah. I like to go there because they have really cheap milk, they have cheap bread; they have lots of good meat. Yeah, I like that store.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah. They have a lot of delicious bread also.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You like the bakery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I do like the bakery at Maxx Value.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s good because actually I know you bake. You like to bake bread. So if you like the bakery, their bread must be good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : It is good. I recommend it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. I&#39;ll go check it out.
 </p>
 <p>
