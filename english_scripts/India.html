  India is full of surprises. When you are in India you see many things that are very shocking and very strange to your culture. For example, the cow is a very holy animal there. It&#39;s part of the religion so you don&#39;t eat meat in India, and the cows are allowed to go free and go wherever they want, so maybe when you are driving down the street there will be a cow standing in the middle of the road and you have to drive around him, so this is very, very strange sight. You&#39;ll never see a cow in New York city, but you will see a cow in the middle of New Delhi city and it&#39;s very surprising at first, and maybe another strange site are the holy men, the Indian Sadus or Indian holy men. They give up everything. They give up their family, they give up all their belongings. They give up their car, their money, and they just wonder around the country, from religious site to religious site, and they beg for their food and they beg for money to take the bus, and they all wear orange, orange robes and many of them have big long beards and long hair, and they are very distinctive looking, and their very wonderful people, very kind and very nice, and they&#39;re very, their inner strength for their religion and for life is very strong and you learn a lot from these people, and you learn a lot from India

  My name is Jeff Eagar. I&#39;m from Canada but I just spent six months in India and I love India. I think India is my favorite country in the whole world. India is very interesting. It&#39;s real life. It&#39;s the good and the bad, and the rich and the poor, and the happy and the struggling, all together in one country, and when you go to India, you feel a lot of emotion, you feel a lot of sadness and happiness and joy and that&#39;s why India is my favorite country.

  India is a very interesting culture, and it&#39;s a very old culture. It takes a little bit of time for you to get used to India when you go there. They go things differently from other countries. I was eating with my hands in India. You eat with your hand and your left hand acts as toilet paper, because they don&#39;t have toilet paper in India, and they are mostly Hindu and they believe in the Hindi, Hindu religion, and it&#39;s a very old religion. A very beautiful religion, they have many gods and many deities, and it&#39;s very colorful and they do lots, lots of religions ceremonies with fire and with bells, and with holy priests, and it&#39;s very visually, for your eyes, it&#39;s an interesting place, a very interesting thing to see
