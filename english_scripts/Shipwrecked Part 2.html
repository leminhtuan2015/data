 : So we spent fourteen hours floating in the sea, and we floated all night until the next day. At mid-morning the next day, a fisherman -- we had drifted during the night. When we first went down, there was nothing, just open sea all around us, so it was very frightening, and then during the night we
 <span class="audionotes">
  drifted
 </span>
 with the current, so the next day we maybe five or six kilometers away from an island, so we were in view of an island, but still too far to swim. The current was too strong, but a fisherman in a small kayak saw us and paddled into the nearest island, and they rescued us with a bigger boat, and once my feet touched the land again I cried. I really cried for
 <span class="audionotes">
  a good hard cry
 </span>
 . I was so happy to be alive. It was the only time I cried in the last fifteen or twenty years.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ve known you for awhile, you&#39;re not a very sensitive guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : And then we had to go back. My brother was hurt, so we had to take him to the hospital in London, and it took him a few weeks to recover, and after that we went back and reshot the documentary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : What happened to your brother?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : He was -- he got some cuts. When the boat was going down, he was cut from the barnacles on the hull of the boat, and he got a serious blood
  <span class="audionotes">
   infection
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : I mean you&#39;re lucky there weren&#39;t any sharks or anything I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : Well that was a big fear. The captain was saying that all night long. He was saying, you know, there&#39;re sharks in this water, and you know, he was a bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   deranged
  </span>
  , and he was really worried about the sharks, so yeah, we were all pretty afraid of the sharks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Wow, you made it out. Everybody
  <span class="audionotes">
   made it out
  </span>
  OK. Everybody was alright?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  : Yep, survived to live another day.
