   Todd:
  </strong>
  Eli, could you talk a little bit about what you study to be an animator and how the industry has changed over the years?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, I actually studied, the degree I did was a graphic design course, which taught you art, every aspect of graphic design but they looked at graphic design as actually communication design which is basically just trying to get a message across a certain way thought the use of graphics, you know graphical methods, so I mean, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean just you know text, words, on a screen, you know, words on a poster. I mean, people&#39;s people&#39;s views of graphic design is usually like posters, advertising, um, adverts in magazines but we were sort of made to think that that is just a tiny bit of graphic design, I mean you can communicate message, through any medium, you know even sort of acting, and stuff like that, they were, it was really that broad so, obviously with my love of anime I chose animation, I mean, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been interested in for a long time and I do 3D computer animation kind of like &#34;Toy Story&#34; but obviously not as good. I was actually the only person on my course doing that, so it was quite a challenge. I had an amazing animation tutor, who had got some pretty amazing portfolio behind him, to help me out, and if it wasn&#39;t for him, I probably would have torn my hair out years ago and maybe even quit the course cause I, there was a big, dispute with sort of my view of computer animation, what I was interested in with the graphic design tutor&#39;s views, they were all about deep meaning and you know, messages behind work and I was actually about learning how to animate well, you know the techniques of animation. I mean it&#39;s always very important to have the background skills of ideas because you can be technically good at something, you can be able to use a computer program brilliantly, but if you don&#39;t have the sort of ideas or background then you&#39;re never going to be able to make a good piece. I mean, I&#39;ve heard that Pixar, the company who make &#34;Toy Story&#34; actually hire actors instead of animators to do their animating. They hire them for their acting skills and then they teach them how to use the software afterwards, cause actually, that&#39;s what it&#39;s about, it&#39;s making characters act, it&#39;s whatever it is, whether it&#39;s a coke can or a book, if you want to give that a personality, you got to think about how you&#39;re gonna give this inanimate object a personality, how are you going to make it looked scared, how are you going to make it look happy, um, that&#39;s what I was interested in, sort of techniques of learning how to do that, so, yeah, it was a struggle but it was definitely worth it in the end, and I think I&#39;ll go on to have a good career.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Raphael, what did you study at university?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  My main specialty is stage design, but stage design is basically theater decoration, but it tends to disappear because there is not so many job in this field, so it&#39;s closely related to interior design and light design as well, so basically I&#39;m doing light and interior design. That&#39;s my job!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Why is theater design going away? Because people are not going to the theater?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  No it&#39;s not being away, but the point is it&#39;s a difficult job because there&#39;s not so many money coming from this practice, you know, because the theater system is not, not so many people go to the theater comparing to cinema or exhibits or, you know, this kind of things, and it&#39;s quite a reserved to the helet, and it&#39;s very difficult for the, actually, the artists who works in this area cause there&#39;s not a lot of money coming from it so just living, like designing for theater is quite difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I can imagine. So, what kind of design would you like to do then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Now, I&#39;m really interested in light design. That&#39;s the reason why I came to Japan, because they have some really interesting light designer here, especially because they don&#39;t have the same strict architecture rules that we have in France, like every time you want to build something new, or just decorate a shop, anything, you need, once the project is over, everything&#39;s prepared you need to show it to an architect who specialize in this very rules. He will tell you if you can or not actually build it, corresponding to the rhythm of the existing buildings, you know the lines, the structure of everything, things like that. It&#39;s really difficult, so Japan is changing faster, they destruct, they build a new building, and they destruct, and they build something new, they don&#39;t really care about the past of the buildings so there&#39;s a lot of liberty from light designer. It&#39;s very free. They can do some really interesting things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, what would be your dream job, if you could have any job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  My dream job? I wish I could make a connection between my light design skills and my taste for music, sound design. Actually it&#39;s, theater is one place where these things mix up. Cinema is one place where it mix up as well, but there&#39;s not a lot of fields where you can like think at the same time about the effect produced by the sound, and the effect produced by the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, it&#39;s be like a scary movie has dark lighting and dark music?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, this kind of thing. This kind of, but when you want to produce a moment because it&#39;s basically what it&#39;s about, it&#39;s producing a moment, a feeling, like you can use any media, right? Whatever it is, it&#39;s not important. The important is what are you creating, has an effect, but when you use at the same time, light and sound it&#39;s quite complement, complementary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Well, best of luck.
 </p>
