   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : So, Ginger, I hear you have a new apartment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Yes, it&#39;s great. I just moved in last week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Nice. Where is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s near Victory Monument. Do you know where that is?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I do. How do you get to work from there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Well, I take the Sky Train.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s really convenient. It is. It is. It&#39;s just a five minute walk. And what&#39;s the neighborhood like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s a crowded neighborhood. There are a lot of people. Lots of cars. Just lots of energy in general.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : And is it
  <span class="audionotes">
   conveniently located
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s very convenient. It&#39;s about a five minute walk to the Sky Train station.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Why did you decide to move?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Well, it&#39;s near a park, and I love living near a park and it&#39;s also just a five minute walk to my gym.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : And have you made any new friends in that neighborhood?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : I have. I&#39;ve met a couple of new people in my apartment building, and I&#39;ve gotten to know a person who owns a restaurant across the street. There&#39;s some great restaurants on the street also.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Oh, what kind of restaurants?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Well, most Thai restaurants. A lot of Thai people live in the area, but there&#39;s also a Western restaurant and a Japanese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : And is it a safe neighborhood?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : I feel very safe there. I&#39;ve heard that there&#39;s some thefts on some of the quiet streets where the motorbikes will
  <span class="audionotes">
   snatch your bag
  </span>
  off your shoulder, but I&#39;ve never actually seen it myself, and I feel very safe sleeping there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : What about traffic?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : There is a lot of traffic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Oh, no!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Yes. the traffic ... and a lot of street traffic too. Lots of people walking on the streets, so it can be
  <span class="audionotes">
   tough to get around
  </span>
  . But there&#39;s still a lot of excitement in the area so it&#39;s fun to be out and
  <span class="audionotes">
   people watch
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : It doesn&#39;t sound like a quiet neighborhood.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : No, it&#39;s not quiet at all. Unless you go into the park, and then it&#39;s very quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : How often do you go to the park?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Almost every night. Every night after work I&#39;ll take a walk in the park and there&#39;s a pond with a water display with music, so it can be very
  <span class="audionotes">
   soothing
  </span>
  .
