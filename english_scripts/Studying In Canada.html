  Steve, I have a friend who wants to go study in Canada. What&#39;s the best way for a student to get into a Canadian University?

   Steve:
  </strong>
  Well, it all depends on your nationality, and your level of English, in terms of your TOEFL score. If you have a very low TOEFL score then probably your best bet would be to first go to Canada for three to six months and study in an English college there, and try to improve your English. While in Canada you can take practice TOEFL tests, and you can find tutors to help you write essays, then when you return to your home country, if it&#39;s Japan, there&#39;s lots of good English schools, English tutors in Japan, Korea as well. I&#39;m not too familiar with other countries but basically you have to apply for a student visa. It&#39;s usually not that difficult to get. Along with your student visa, you&#39;ll have to take a TOEFL test, which requires you to understand grammar.

  There&#39;s a listening portion, um, there&#39;s a reading comprehension portion, and the most difficult portion for non-native English speakers is the essay question, because you have to write an essay during the TOEFL test, so I recommend that you practice writing essays and if you want more information I would ask the Canadian Embassy in your country or do a search on the internet where there&#39;s lots of information.
