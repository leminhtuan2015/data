   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Phil, I&#39;m thinking about going to China and I&#39;m really into nature. I love wildlife. Can you recommend anything to me?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  The best thing I did in China was go through Zhang Jia Jie National Park. That&#39;s Hunan Province, and if you like nature, that&#39;s really highly recommended. It&#39;s an UNESCO cite. It&#39;s easy to find on the internet, but it&#39;s just craters, gorges, trees sticking out of really strangely shaped hills, lots of caverns and very very few people there. It was empty when I was there. I had never heard of it before. I had just been recommended by a tour guide. It was
  <span class="audiodef">
   spectacular
  </span>
  . If you like nature and like hiking it will definitely give you a
  <span class="audiodef">
   workout
  </span>
  and you&#39;ll take a lot of pictures.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, well, how big is this park?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Good question. I didn&#39;t see the whole thing, and I spend three days there walking different parts every day, so I really don&#39;t know the size of it except that it&#39;s massive. So you just went hiking and then you camped overnight, or did you just hiked for the day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Just day hikes, the tour I had been organized with had rented us a hotel, just stayed in the hotel, slept there at night, and walked most of the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh. Did you see any
  <span class="audiodef">
   wildlife
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Some insects and some butterflies, but no, nothing, no
  <span class="audiodef">
   mammals
  </span>
  , nothing like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Was the, were the trails
  <span class="audiodef">
   steep
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but most of them do have stairs so, regardless of your fitness level I don&#39;t think it would be very difficult for anybody to, some people might be a bit slower than others but you should be able to make it up alright.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, where is this again? You said in Hunan Province!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I believe it&#39;s North-Western Hunan Province.
