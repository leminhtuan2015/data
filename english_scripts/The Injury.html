   I ended up in the hospital once after a baseball practice. What happened was, I was on first base trying to run to second base, as you might know in baseball that&#39;s called stealing a base, so as I was stealing second base I tried to slide and rather than putting my hands up to protect them I landed on my arm and as soon as my arm hit the ground, everyone could hear a large &#34;snap&#34;. It was like somoeone snapping their fingers really loud, and it was so loud that my dad, who was playing catcher asked me, &#34;Did you break your arm?&#34; and I took a look at my arm and it was completely out of shape.

   It wasn&#39;t straight anymore. It was bent and I was actually very calm. I answered him, &#34;Yeah, I broke my arm, so instead of crying or panicing, I was very calm about it, and he took me to the hospital. The doctor put my arm back in its normal place, put a cast on it, and that was that.
