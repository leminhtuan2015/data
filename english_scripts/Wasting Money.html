   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Anita, we&#39;re talking about money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I have some questions for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Fire away
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  First question: are you good at saving money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  You know now that I got married, I think I&#39;m much better at saving money, than I was before.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think it&#39;s definitely one thing that
  <span class="audionotes">
   comes with age
  </span>
  . The older you get, the better you get at saving money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Definitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But we all waste money, so what is something you waste money on?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Oh, what do I waste money on? Probably movie rentals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Movie rentals, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I love watching movies, and I am capable of renting five movies a week, so that&#39;s one thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know, actually, not that you mention it, I have a huge problem with movie rentals, not so much the movie rental but the late fee. I&#39;m terrible. Like, I&#39;ll have a movie for two weeks, and I could have bought the movie for the price I have to pay for the rental, for the late fee. Oh,
  <span class="audionotes">
   it drives me nuts
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  You should do what I did. I moved to a new apartment last month and that apartment is right in front of  a movie rental place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the solution. Always live by the movie rental place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s my way of saving money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, these days you can actually download movies on the internet which is really convenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  If you&#39;re American, yes. Usually many of these websites where you can
  <span class="audionotes">
   legally download
  </span>
  movies are only for American or people with American credit cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Unfortunately, it&#39;s not available to the rest of the world yet, but I know in my country we have a website where you can rent movies. You download them from the internet and you get a special password, so the movie, you can only access the movie within those 24 hours that you rent it for. I&#39;ve never tried it but the system is there and I think it&#39;s a great system.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a cool technology.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yeah, very.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What about other things like music and books? Do you spend a lot of money on that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Books, yes. Books yes. Music not as much. But one thing I definitely spend a lot of money on is my phone bill.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Talking on the phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Yes, talking on the phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, actually it&#39;s funny because those are two things I never waste money on. 1) I hate talking on the phone, so I&#39;m never on the phone. I always have extra  minutes, and 2) for books, go to the library. It&#39;s free.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  But then you can&#39;t keep the book at home and
  <span class="audionotes">
   the whole beauty of reading a book
  </span>
  it to... after you&#39;ve read it, put it in your own personal library and feel good about yourself when you look at your library and think. &#34;Ah, I&#39;ve read so many books&#34; but I like having books at home because you can reread them anytime you feel like it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s interesting. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever reread a book, ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, one time and that&#39;s it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maybe I just don&#39;t have the same love of reading as you do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Could be.
 </p>
