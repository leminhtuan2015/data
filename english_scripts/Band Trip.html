   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Alex you were saying that you took trips, band trips.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Yes, sir.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so why don&#39;t you talk about a band trip.
 </p>

   Alex:
  </strong>
  OK, let&#39;s see. The band trip we went to Florida, Disneyland actually. It was a lot of fun. Actually getting the money for the band trip, I had to fundraise a lot, and that was just a big humongous problem, cause, I don&#39;t know, the band organization was kind of disorganized, anyway, so the band trip, we went to Disneyland. It was a lot of fun, but we ended up playing frisbee all the time because we had nothing better to do really, and to tell you the truth I like Disneyland, but it&#39;s kind of kiddish
  <strong>
  </strong>
  to tell you the truth, um but it&#39;s a lot of fun. We actually, where did we march, Epcot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, the Epcot Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we marched around the Epcot center an hour or a half or so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how long was the trip down there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Oh, we actually, we flew so, it wasn&#39;t that long. A couple of hours at most. The funny part is, half the band isn&#39;t, they hadn&#39;t flown before the actual trip so everybody was kind of nervous. It was kind of funny, but yeah I made a lot of friends. It was very interesting. I mean I got made of, made fun of, excuse me, in school, because you know the whole marching band, band geek, whatever
  <strong>
  </strong>
  but it was a lot of fun. You make a lot of friends and you just get out there and do what you like and it&#39;s a lot of fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that sounds like a fun trip. So when you were at Disneyland did you see Mickey mouse?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex:
  </strong>
  Yes, I did.
