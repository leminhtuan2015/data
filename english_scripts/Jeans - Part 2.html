  Todd:
 </strong>
 Now, Mariel, what kind of clothes do you love to wear?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  My favorite clothing is jeans, for sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so you then are
  <span class="audionotes">
   the jeans expert
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  I could be. What would you like to know?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, there&#39;s so many kinds of jeans now and it&#39;s a bit confusing so what is
  <span class="audionotes">
   trendy
  </span>
  or popular right now?

  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Right now? You see different kinds of trends, but I think tight jeans and
  <span class="audionotes">
   baggy jeans
  </span>
  are very popular.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, wow, that&#39;s quite a difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   It&#39;s a contrast
  </span>
  . Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, let&#39;s start with the baggy jeans. First of all, who likes to wear baggy jeans?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  I think baggy jeans go with
  <span class="audionotes">
   the hip-hop kind of style
  </span>
  . Also, skateboarders really like to wear baggy jeans. People who like to feel relaxed and move around a lot are usually baggy jeans fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What about you? Do you like to wear baggy jeans?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Oh, those are my favorite kind of jeans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Your favorite?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I love to wear baggy jeans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s just that they&#39;re so easy to wear and so relaxed and I can just do whatever I want in baggy jeans I feel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sounds good. Well, then what about tight jeans?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Mm, tight jeans. To me they&#39;re very unconfortable, but a lot of girls like to wear them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, usually only girls wear tight jeans?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mariel:
  </strong>
  Some guys do as well. Again, those people are usually very trendy and it&#39;s quite often that punk people and rock people wear tight jeans.
