   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Anita, we&#39;re talking about money. When you go shopping, do you prefer to pay by cash or credit card?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  You know, there are times when I prefer paying by credit card because it makes me feel better because
  <span class="audionotes">
   at the end of the day
  </span>
  , I don&#39;t feel like I spent that money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  Because if I pay by cash, that money is gone out of your wallet, and you really feel it missing, so there are times when I prefer credit cards. There are times when I prefer cash, but if you look at it
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the long run
  </span>
  , I prefer cash because you know exactly what your financial situation is. You don&#39;t have to worry about getting a credit card bill at the end of the month, and not being able to pay it, so I would say I prefer cash.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know, I used to think exactly like you do, but I changed because I found that when I was using cash, I couldn&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep track
  </span>
  of how I was spending my money. I really had no record. I couldn&#39;t keep the receipts. I would lose the receipts, so a friend of mine said you should do everything on credit card or debit card and then it&#39;s on the computer. You can check, and then you could buy software and you can keep track of your finances and I did it and it works. It&#39;s really good, like I&#39;m more careful with my money because I know exactly what I am spending on and I can check it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true. That&#39;s true, and I do something similar except I don&#39;t have computer software for it but I have a little cash book where I write my expenses.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You mean writing, actual work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anita:
  </strong>
  I.. yes actual work: pen and paper, but for me that works better because if I use my credit card unlike you, I
  <span class="audionotes">
   lose track
  </span>
  of my spending. I forget when I use the credit card, when I didn&#39;t use it and it&#39;s much easier for me to buy things with a credit card. If you have cash in your wallet and the cash is not enough to buy whatever you want, you know that you cannot afford it,  but with a credit card, that is not there so sometimes you tend to overspend and buy things you don&#39;t actually need.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  True, that is a good point. I guess
  <span class="audionotes">
   the key thing
  </span>
  is to be careful.
