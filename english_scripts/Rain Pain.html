  Daniel:
 </strong>
 Hey how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Fine and you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Fine thanks. I have a topic for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s a really, what do you think of the weather? Do you like this kind of like really changing weather, thunderstorms.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Actually not that much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  No?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  No. I don&#39;t like the things like this every day raining.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   annoying
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  The
  <span class="audionotes">
   combination
  </span>
  of rain plus humidity plus hot, I don&#39;t like it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, for me it&#39;s really difficult to get used to it because for me rain means winter and cold weather and having, you know if it&#39;s raining I&#39;m going to get my umbrella and my coat, my scarf and everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  And it will be cold of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, of course. But sometimes it just rains and it&#39;s really hot. You&#39;re wearing
  <span class="audionotes">
   flip-flops
  </span>
  so I don&#39;t know it is, at least now it&#39;s not a matter if I like it or not, it&#39;s I&#39;m not used to it and I don&#39;t really know what to wear when it&#39;s raining.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. It&#39;s like summer clothes and rain doesn&#39;t go at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it doesn&#39;t go together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Valeria: No, no, no
  <span class="audionotes">
   and another thing
  </span>
  that bores me a little is, I mean in Argentina if it rains one day, it&#39;s one day and maybe it will rain again in one week but every day raining is kind of too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  I need to wash my clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Exactly
  </span>
  . I have the same problem. I have exactly the same problem.
