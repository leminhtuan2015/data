   So, Mark, what do Kiwis like to do in the summer?

   Yeah, I think the first thing for some people to realise is that Christmas is midsummer in New Zealand.

    Mark:

   So Kiwis combine Christmas holiday and New Year holiday with a summer vacation as well.
   <br>
   I can remember when I was small, we’d have family Christmases and then the next day, which is Boxing Day, we’d go to the beach or we’d travel somewhere and rent a small house on the beach. They call them ‘batches’ in the north of the island or ‘cribs’ in the south island. And you just spend 4, 5 days, maybe a week, 2 weeks, just swimming in the sea, playing in the sand dunes, walks in the forest: just a really relaxing time with family and family friends.

   That sounds nice, so you know in Australia they’re really

   There is a surfing population. I think the Australian beaches are probably much larger and
   <br>
   maybe they have better waves, I don’t know, but several of my friends used to go on surfing holidays in summer as well.

   And what foods do people like to eat when they get together for the summer?

   Barbecue is almost

   What meats do people barbecue?

   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Again, New Zealand foods used to very much sort of be the lamb or beef, but now it’s getting a lot more varied, you can grill a nice fish on the barbecue, you can still have sausage, chicken, pork, beef, lamb, whatever you want.
