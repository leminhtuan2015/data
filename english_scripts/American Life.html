   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Yoko!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Hi!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  We&#39;re going to talk about your trip to America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Trip to America. OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. When did you go to the U.S.?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s about 4 years ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And what did you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Actually, I went to Michigan and I worked as a
  <span class="audiodef">
   volunteer teacher
  </span>
  in public school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What was the
  <span class="audiodef">
   public school
  </span>
  like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  It was not big, and so it was not big. I don&#39;t know how to say that, so what should I say....
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It was just a small school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Small school. So only maybe 200 students I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was really small.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that is small.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did you know all the students?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so. I just visited some classes. Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what did you think of America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  I think it is a
  <span class="audiodef">
   great country
  </span>
  for many people who wants to try new things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  You know, so for example I did not have any
  <span class="audiodef">
   special skills
  </span>
  to teach, but they let me to work there as a volunteer, and they gave me a great oppurtunity to meet a lot of students, who are really nice I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, OK. I agree. What were your students like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  They were really motivated to learn Japanese, but they didn&#39;t learn a lot. They just, they just wanted to play with me, from other countries. Who is from, sorry!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Do you have any special memories from your trip?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yoko:
  </strong>
  Yes, I visited lots of places
  <span class="audiodef">
   by myself
  </span>
  and I was really afraid of speaking English to people there but they tried to understand me, and they helped me a lot and I really think OK, they are lots of people who are nice all over the world.
