U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday during a visit to Afghanistan that the Trump administration is aim(ing for a peace deal in the war-ravaged country by Sep)tember.
<br><br>
"Now I've said the word 'peace' more than half a dozen times.  It's our priority.  But the pursuit of peace should not wait until the Afghan presidential election.  Election planning must go forward without delay as we pursue the peace that Afghans deserve."
<br><br>
His visit came as American and Taliban negotiators prepared to meet in Qatar later this week for the next round of talks in their months-long dialogue aimed at finding a political settlement to the Afghan war.
<br><br>
Afghanistan is due to hold presidential elections on September 28.

The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection says he's stepping down as his agency is under siege over the discovery of dozens of children in filthy conditions at one of its stations in Texas.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Shelley Adler reports.
<br><br>
Although he did not give a reason, Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders said in a message to employees that he would be resigning on July 5.
<br><br>
Previously CBP's chief operating officer, Sanders was named acting commissioner in April.  That's after the agency's previous leader, Kevin McAleenan, became acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
<br><br>
CBP is the agency that apprehends and first detains migrant parents and children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump told VOA on Tuesday that the U.S. was close to reaching a safe third-country agreement with the Central American country of Guatemala.
<br><br>
An unsigned draft agreement obtained by VOA and presented by a U.S. delegation to Guatemala on June 13, a deal between Guatemala and the United States would block Salvadoran and Honduran nationals from seeking asylum in the United States.  Most asylum-seekers would have no choice but to file their claims in Guatemala.
<br><br>
According to the United Nations, in 2018, Guatemalans made up the second-highest group of foreign nationals applying for U.S. asylum right behind the nationals of El Salvador.

After pulling back from a strike on Iran, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new round of sanctions targeting the country's leadership.
<br><br>
Tehran has hinted at willingness to negotiate if the United States would lift the sanctions.  White House Correspondent Patsy Widakuswara has the latest.
<br><br>
Trump ordered the fresh round of sanctions on Monday following weekend reports that the U.S. launched cyber attacks on computers used by Iranian intelligence.  Tehran called the attacks a violation of international law and dismissed the latest round of sanctions.
<br><br>
"Is there any sanction left for America to impose that has not been imposed on us recently or in the past 40 years?  And is there anything they gain from this?"
<br><br>
The administration targeted sanctions on Iran's highest authority, Ayatollah Khamenei, blaming him for the regime's hostile conduct.  But some observers question the effectiveness of the sanctions, considering it's unlikely that Khamenei would use financial instruments under American jurisdiction.

The fianc&eacute;e of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has taken her campaign for justice over his grisly slaying to the United Nations' top human rights body.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Charles De Ledesma reports.
<br><br>
Turkish citizen Hatice Cengiz has urged the U.N. to take the next step following a blistering report from an independent investigator on alleged Saudi involvement in Jamal Khashoggi's slaying.
<br><br>
Cengiz says she hasn't gotten over the October 2 killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.  She remains haunted by the prospect that Khashoggi might not really be dead because his body has never been found.
<br><br>
She is engaged in speaking on the theme "silencing dissent," which mostly criticized alleged rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
