   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Jessica, you lived in Spain right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Yes
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, believe it or not I&#39;m going to Spain this summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Are you really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, on my way home I decided to stop over in Europe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So I plan to spend about ten days in Spain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool. very cool!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do you recommend I do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  OK, well, I lived in Madrid, so I&#39;m a little bit partial to that city. It&#39;s a really, really, nice time.., when are you going?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I should get there mid August.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  OK, then stay away from Madrid because it&#39;s too hot. It&#39;s about like 40, 45 degrees Celsius, so it&#39;s really, really hot. So, the south is really, extremely warm as well, but the north and the east coast is really nice, cause they have a lot of really nice beaches, and Barcelona is really beautiful. It&#39;s a really great place. They have this cathedral there by Gaudi which is incredible, it&#39;s incredible. Ah, Valencia is really cool. It&#39;s a very nice place to go. They have a really nice beach. A really nice downtown city. The southern coast is really nice. They, but it&#39;s incredibly hot, like I said so, so you definitely have to take advantage of the siesta, and sleep through the majority of the day and then stay up late at night, so you wouldn&#39;t burn outside basically, so sleep away the warmest part of the day, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now if I can go to one country around Spain - Morocco, Portugal, or France, which one would you recommend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  I would say that Morocco is definitely the most different. It&#39;s definitely the most unique. Portugal is very similar to Spain, and France is of course France. Personally I would probably go to France, but if you want something very exotic and different, Morocco is definitely, definitely the place to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd: O
  </strong>
  K, thanks Jessica.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Thank you.
