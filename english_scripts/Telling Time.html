   Todd
  </strong>
  : Natalie, let&#39;s talk about times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Like, when we do things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : First, when do you get up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I get up around 7:30.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I get up early too. I don&#39;t get up at 7:30, but I get up at 8:00.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, well, sometimes I get up at 8:00. Maybe at the weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Actually, I always wake up at 6:00. I wake up very early, but I don&#39;t get out of bed. I wake up. I have some water, and then I sleep some more. I sleep two more hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s a bad habit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Sometimes I wake up at 7:30 and I play on my phone for maybe an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s so bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I read that it&#39;s not good to check your phone in bed. I never check my phone in bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, I should try that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about breakfast? When do you eat breakfast?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I usually eat breakfast at around 8:30, but sometimes I don&#39;t have breakfast.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : No time. How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I usually have breakfast right away. I wake up at 8:00 or I get out of bed at 8:00 and then I eat something at 8:15. I eat something as soon as I get up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh. No. I usually have to wait before I can eat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, I always eat and I always have coffee very early.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Do you have coffee every day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Every day. I have three cups of coffee. I have one cup of coffee around 8:00. I have another cup of coffee around 10:00 and then I have my last cup of coffee around 2:00 or 3:00.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Whoa, three coffees?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. My office is by a café and the café has really good coffee. I love their café mochas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, I really don&#39;t like the taste of coffee, but I do love a hot chocolate.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  :  Oh, I hear you. When do you start your day at work or school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Well, I work as a teacher, so I start at 9:00 a.m.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s fairly early.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it&#39;s okay. I work for a few hours in the morning and lunch comes by really quickly. How about you? When does your day start?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Well, I have two jobs. Now, I make websites and I work at an office. I start at 12:00, so noon. I start my day late. I finish working at 8:00 or 9:00 at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I wish I started work at 12:00, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d enjoy working so late.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, it&#39;s great. I love it, because there&#39;s no traffic at noon when I go to work and there&#39;s less traffic at night when I come home. I finish at 9:00 and the train is not crowded and it&#39;s really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : How long does it take to get to work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It takes 15 minutes by train. If the weather is nice, on nice sunny days I walk to work, it takes one hour and I walk home, it takes another hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I bet that&#39;s really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It is nice. I like to walk to work and I like to walk home. I work at night, so I eat dinner really late. I eat dinner at 10:00 and that&#39;s very late and a little unhealthy. When do you eat dinner?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Well, yeah, 10:00 p.m. is really late. I&#39;m usually in bed at that time. I usually have dinner I&#39;d say maybe 7:30 p.m.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. You have dinner before I finish work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I know, but if I don&#39;t eat at that time, I get really cranky.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You go to bed around 10:00?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, most nights, but at the weekend, I usually go to bed later. I&#39;d say midnight, sometimes 1:00 a.m. or 2:00 a.m.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. That&#39;s interesting, because on workdays, Monday to Friday, I go to bed late, but on the weekend, my days off, I go to bed early.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. On Saturday night and Sunday night, I go to bed at 10:00, but Monday to Friday I work, I go to bed at 12:00 or 1:00.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Why get up early at the weekend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t know. I actually don&#39;t like staying up late, but I do it for my job. It&#39;s strange I guess. On the weekends, some people like to sleep in. On the weekends, I like to go to bed early.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, my. At the weekend, I love to have a lie in bed. Sometimes I stay in bed all day and watch movies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, you know, I&#39;m guilty of that too. I do that also.
