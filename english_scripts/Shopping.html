  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Shona, you talked about shopping today. You bought some food and you bought some furniture. Are you a big shopping fan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Not really to be honest. I&#39;m not one of those people who go shopping every weekend or every weekday, or you know, but to be honest, like if I am around shops, and I do see something that I really like, I don&#39;t have much
  <span class="audionotes">
   willpower
  </span>
  , and I will buy it, which isn&#39;t great, but yeah, I have
  <span class="audionotes">
   accumulated
  </span>
  like a few, you know, things over the years, specifically clothes, which I do enjoy buying.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you like shopping for clothes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  I like shopping for clothes but I don&#39;t really like shopping for anything else.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now when you buy your clothes, are you saying you usually
  <span class="audionotes">
   buy clothes on impulse
  </span>
  . You see them and you like them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true. Yeah, I probably would say that. I&#39;m not like staying at home and looking at catalogues, and I think, &#34;Oh, I want a black t-shirt&#34; and I go out and buy that. I will just be wondering about. Something will
  <span class="audionotes">
   catch my eye
  </span>
  , and I&#39;ll think it looks nice so I might end up buying it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know, these days, you mentioned a catalogue. These days you can buys stuff on the internet quite easily. Have you ever bought clothes over the internet?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yes, I have actually. Yeah, I&#39;ve bought a couple of items over the internet which is like lots of fun, because &#39;Is it going to fit?, Is it going to look nice?&#39; You don&#39;t know, so once you get it it&#39;s like always a bit exciting, like to see how it actually looks in real life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did it fit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah. Actually there we like two really, like, items that I wear quite  a lot, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What did you buy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  I bought like a pen-striped jacket, like this little jacket thing with all these like different badge things on it, and I also bought like, this nice like blue and red and white stripy dress, which is really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool. Now when you shop, do you always pay cash or do you pay by credit card, or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m more like prefer to pay by cash because then I know how much I&#39;m spending, like if you pay with credit card, or whatever, you don&#39;t really, you&#39;re not aware of how much money you&#39;re actually spending, so I prefer to take cash out and pay with that, so then I have more of a budget.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s pretty good because you say you&#39;re an impulse shopper, so I think credit cards usually people like to use them. They see something, they got to have it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Exactly, which is probably going to
  <span class="audionotes">
   lead them into a lot of debt
  </span>
  eventually, which I would try to avoid.

 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Rebecca, talking about shopping, is shopping something you enjoy doing?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes, when I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the mood
  </span>
  for it. Definitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So I guess when you talk about shopping, we talk about clothes shopping, mainly right, so how often do you go clothes shopping?

  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Not very often. Maybe once every three months. It depends on my money. If I have the money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you usually follow the fashions?
  <span class="audionotes">
   Try to stay hip
  </span>
  , and you know?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  No, because sometimes the fashions aren&#39;t comfortable. I prefer comfortable clothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So are you
  <span class="audionotes">
   a bargain shopper
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   I try to be
  </span>
  but if there is something that I really, really like, I will save up and buy it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  For example what is something you saved up to buy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I saved up to buy a really nice black jacket and I&#39;ve had that now for two years so it was definitely a good purchase.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And you bought this in Australia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it wasn&#39;t during the sale, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how much did it cost?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I think it was about two hundred dollars, three hundred dollars. Yeah, so it was quite expensive for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that is a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Mm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Have you ever bought any clothes online?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  No, I haven&#39;t but my friends have and my friends have bought shoes and dresses and tops and, yeah, they really love shopping online.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, they have no problems? Everything is OK?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Everything is OK. They haven&#39;t had any problems at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how come you don&#39;t shop online?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I think I prefer the contact with sales people and seeing dresses and clothes and trying them on.
  <span class="audionotes">
   You never know if
  </span>
  they&#39;re going to fit or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right.
