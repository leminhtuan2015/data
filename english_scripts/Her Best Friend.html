   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Okay, Rebecca, you quizzed me about my best friend, now your turn. Who&#39;s your best friend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  My best friend is maybe one of my best friends from college. His name is Richard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Where did you meet him?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Actually, we met in college because my roommate was out hunting for people with similar interests, and so she put on a t-shirt from Final Fantasy Seven. Actually she caught me with the same t-shirt. And she found this guy&#39;s. She&#39;s like &#34;Oh, I know that game. It&#39;s Final Fantasy Seven&#34; and so we all started talking because of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  So is that why you&#39;re good friends, because of this common interest?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I think that does have a lot to do with it. We had a lot of good times as a group playing video games together or watching different Tv shows and a lot of cartoons and anime and stuff, but I think we&#39;re good friends because of the amount of time we spend together. When we were in college, we both had similar majors. We were both doing the English major with our foreign language which is Japanese, so you only have a certain number of classes you can take, and we ended up being in all the same classes, so we spent a lot of time together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  So, how often do you meet each other these days?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Nowadays we both live really far apart. He&#39;s out in Tokyo and I&#39;m actually down here in Kyuushuu so we&#39;re really far apart, but the modern world is all full of technology so meet online a lot. Like we talk using skype, so we talk on the phone basically
  <span class="audionotes">
   for hours on end
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Do you ever fight with him?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  If we stay apart from each other, we don&#39;t fight, but if we visit each other which we do on occasion, we have to keep the visit to under a week because if not, we&#39;ll start trying to kill each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  So what do you usually fight about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Oh, it&#39;s always silly little things like he does one of my pet peeve&#39;s is people who chew with their mouth open. Like I
  <span class="audionotes">
   can&#39;t handle it
  </span>
  and normally for you know like the first so many days, I can
  <span class="audionotes">
   get over it
  </span>
  , but once you get past that week part, it&#39;s you know, the one week, it&#39;s like &#34;Uh, nope, nope. I&#39;m gonna kill you now. Done! I&#39;ve
  <span class="audionotes">
   reached my limit
  </span>
  .
  <span class="audionotes">
   Game over
  </span>
  .&#34; (Note: There are two separate notes)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Great. Thanks very much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  No problem.
