   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Hey, Vella. Well we&#39;re talking about things, big things you want to achieve in your life, so how about you? What do want to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Well, one of my biggest dreams is to become an actress.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Uh-uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Because I really love acting and, you know, it would be fun to act in a movie and to play, you know, as a different character than who you really are.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Uh-uh. What kind of movies especially, do you have any preferences?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : I would love to try all characters. You know, maybe play in a horror movie or comedy or romance, anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Where do you want to do this? Back in Indonesia, in the States?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Well, I would love to become a Hollywood actress, but it might be too impossible so I would just try in Indonesia first, and maybe if I can go international, then that would be amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK, good. Do you have any, like do you want to do it within ten years or something?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Well, since I&#39;m graduating pretty soon, I would love to try, you know, as soon as I get back to Indonesia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Uh-uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : And, you know, start trying to go to
  <span class="audionotes">
   agencies
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Is there any other dream that you want to achieve?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : This might sound silly, but I love Ricky Martin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Uh-uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : And, you know, I really want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   have the chance
  </span>
  to meet him and maybe dance with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Because he&#39;s Latino and I&#39;m really into Latin culture, and I know that dancing is really, you know, a big part of the culture.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Oh, yeah, it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : And it will be really amazing if I could just dance, you know, with Ricky Martin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : He&#39;s a really good dancer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : And maybe I could be in his music video.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : That would be nice. That would be really, really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : And the last thing is probably get married and
  <span class="audionotes">
   start my own family
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Uh-uh. How is that going? Do you have any plans? Do you have a boyfriend, like do you have any...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Well, I&#39;m in a relationship right now, so hopefully that goes well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Oh, good. So you want to start a family right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : How many children would you like to have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Two to three, maximum three.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Two to three, OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : I would love to have twins.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Wow, why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : A girl and a boy so ....
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Oh, it sounds, it sounds really fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Because no one in my family, you know, has twins, so I think it would be cool to be the first one to have twins.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : But at the same time, it seems to me to be quite hard to raise like twins because everything comes double, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s the same thing as having like two or three children, you know, you just get them at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s why it&#39;s even harder because you have, I don&#39;t know, double
  <span class="audionotes">
   expenses
  </span>
  ,
  <span class="audionotes">
   double everything
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : Yeah, well I&#39;d just love to try having twins.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : No, great, that sounds like a good plan. Thanks.
