  Aiste:
 </strong>
 Hello, Christophe. What are you doing this afternoon?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Hi, Aiste. I think I&#39;m going to run this afternoon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  To run? But it&#39;s raining outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t care. I love running in the rain, and I have to run because I am training for a marathon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  A marathon! Isn&#39;t that like some 100 kilometers of running?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Oh, no. A marathon is a race where you run 42 kilometers. It&#39;s a long distance, so you need to train every day for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  So do you actually run 42 kilometers every day when training for it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Oh, no. Actually, a good preparation for a marathon is about 12 weeks of running, and you never run for 42 kilometers in one training. You never do this because it&#39;s actually very, very bad for your body if you would do that, so you run a
  <span class="audionotes">
   maximum
  </span>
  , like 32 to 34 kilometers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Every day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Not every day of course. I think, right now, I run about 80 kilometers a week, but that&#39;s almost every day, 10, 15 kilometers that you have to run.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  And how many marathons have you done already?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve already ran about four marathons, and now I&#39;m preparing for my fifth marathon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  What is that going to be like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, I hope to run less than three hours. It&#39;s quite fast. It&#39;s like fourteen kilometers average during forty-two kilometers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Whoa!
  </span>
  That sounds difficult. I&#39;m not really into sports very much, so I think for me, even a five-minutes run seems kind of difficult and requiring lots of
  <span class="audionotes">
   endurance
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Well, in the beginning, it&#39;s hard maybe, but once you try running a little bit longer, you really start liking it, so I would recommend you to do one training with me and you start slow and then you
  <span class="audionotes">
   build up
  </span>
  slowly until you can run five, maybe ten kilometers, and then you will see, you will
  <span class="audionotes">
   get addicted
  </span>
  and you will love it too. I think in a couple of years, you will run your first marathon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Oh, that sounds great, but ... I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s for me.
 </p>
