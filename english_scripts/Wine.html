 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, you are a
  <span class="audiodef">
   wine connoisseur
  </span>
  . Or wine teacher. No!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  Not really!

 <p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
  Not really?

   Sandra:
  </strong>
  A wine connoisseur. No, that&#39;s sort of a
  <span class="audiodef">
   snobby
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. So, how would you describe what you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  A wine professional.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A wine professional. OK, so what does a wine professional do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  Try to
  <span class="audiodef">
   make money
  </span>
  from wine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  So, I&#39;m a wine writer, a wine columnist. I teach wine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so let&#39;s say if I&#39;m going to have friends over, and I&#39;m making let&#39;s say steak. I&#39;m having a grilling steak. Can I serve wine with steak?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  Yes. Steak
  <span class="audiodef">
   goes with
  </span>
  almost any red wine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. OK. So, red. How about if I want to mix wines. Is it OK to go red wine, white wine?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  You always start out with white wines going towards red wines.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, always go white wine first, then the red wine. (Yes) OK, and how about for dessert. Is there a special dessert wine?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  There are many great dessert wines, so it depends on what you like, how sweet you like and what you&#39;re making for dessert.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so how about I&#39;m making terimisu.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  Terimisu, then I would probably have a tawny port, either from Portugal or from Australia, which makes great ports, or you might even go for a fruity and oaky zinfandel, which is dry wine from California.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, nice. How much will that cost me?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  Depends on how much you want to spend. For a port, a tawny port, anywhere in between 3,500 to 10,000 (OK) And for a California Zinfandel, a good one probably about 3,000 (yen).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  3,000. I think I can maybe afford that. Not much. And, how about what would be a good wine to
  <span class="audiodef">
   start off
  </span>
  for like appetizers or with a salad or something like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  I always start off with a sparkling wine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A sparkling wine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  Yes. I prefer champagne but if you can&#39;t afford it, even though champagne is the lowest price anywhere in the world is in Japan
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  And many of my students load up on cases of champagne and have it sent home by their companies container.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sandra:
  </strong>
  Yes. But champagne is a good starter.
