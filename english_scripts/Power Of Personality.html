   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : So Rory, in the last conversation we were talking about changing your personality and you never said what you thought of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Well, I think, I think when you learn a language often your personality does change. I notice with my students that they often seem quite different when they speak English to when they speak Japanese. I’m not sure if that’s a language thing or a cultural thing. But I mean you speak more than one language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Yes, I do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Do you think your personality is different in each language?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That’s a really good question. Just thinking of it right now, I think maybe for me it’s more a question of the culture because I think when I am in an environment where I’m expected to be more
  <span class="audionotes">
   extroverted
  </span>
  , I tend to try to live up to that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I tend to try to be more
  <span class="audionotes">
   cheerful
  </span>
  , more open, more friendly or friendlier, I should say. But when I’m somewhere where I know that it’s expected of me to be quieter, I do tend to become more quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : So I don’t know. That’s a really good question.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : And do you think there might be something in languages which make them like a more extroverted language or a more introverted language? Like I think about Italians – maybe it’s a stereotype of Italians, but they seem to be very extroverted and the language seems to help them in that extroversion.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That’s true. That’s very true. That’s a good question because I’m just trying to think of culture and languages in general, and there’s that debate of how cultures and languages are
  <span class="audionotes">
   intertwined
  </span>
  . Is it the culture that came first or is it the language that made the culture the way it is. So I don’t know. I really don’t know. But I would love to read more research and find out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I mean, I noticed since I moved to Asia, to countries like Japan and Korea, the people do seem more
  <span class="audionotes">
   introverted
  </span>
  and the language also seems more introverted. So I wonder if the language or like you say, I wonder which came first, the language or the culture?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : And I think to add on to that, when I think of Asian students that I’ve noticed speaking English, which to some people is a more extroverted language, they always seem more confident.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : They seem friendlier. They seem more open to talking about themselves, their family life. But when you talk to them in their native language, it seems like they
  <span class="audionotes">
   revert back
  </span>
  to their
  <span class="audionotes">
   cultural norms
  </span>
  which would probably be less…
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Right, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Yeah, so maybe there is something there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Yeah. And I guess the culture over here in Asian countries is people are less likely to share information. There’s less – I mean, in the West especially recently, there’s quite a pressure on you to be more open.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That’s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Whereas maybe in Korea, Japan and China, people are more closed and just have different boundaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I’m just trying to think of African countries, like being a Nigerian myself, we’ve had the issue of colonization and where the Western British culture is valorized. So coming from that aspect, I wonder before how we were. Were we more introverted? Because in a lot of ways we’re very similar to Asian cultures and Asian values. We have a lot of that as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now it’s true that being able to speak English and express yourself in a more Western way is a lot. It weighs a lot. It means a lot, so people really enjoy that. People really take their value from that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : So yeah, I think it’s a really interesting topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Because I mean people often see England or British people as a bit introverted and a bit quiet, a bit cold and yet we share the same language as America. And people tend to think that people from North America are quiet brash and extroverted.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That’s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : So like I said it’s more cultural than language-based.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Yeah, maybe. Maybe we’ve come to a solution then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rory
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : We’ve found it. It is the culture more than the language then.
