   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well actually speaking of extreme sports, we&#39;re talking about extreme sports, have you heard about ultra marathon?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m reading a book right now that&#39;s about a tribe of
  <span class="audionotes">
   ultra
  </span>
  runners in Mexico and I thing it&#39;s gonna come on to the subject of ultra marathons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I mean what has the book talked about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  The book talks about this very old tribe who can run for days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Days?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Like days, yeah, and some of the members of this tribe are already in their eighties and nineties and they scale mountains and they have a very frugal diet. They run barefoot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Barefoot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  They run barefoot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  In the desert, on rocks?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  In the desert yeah, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  And they are bought, like they run from, well from they don&#39;t, as soon as they learn to walk they&#39;re running and they run their whole lives and they run like a hundred miles is just like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a walk in the park
  </span>
  to them. They just...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s insane.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  At speed, at speed, at very high speeds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I mean do they have some secret, some traditional secret?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Well, yeah, they do, they&#39;re a very mystical tribe and they&#39;re not that well known. This, the book is written by a journalist who investigates and he records his story of how he gets to meet, just even finding them and meeting them is
  <span class="audionotes">
   a huge ordeal
  </span>
  in itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Because I mean physiologically it sounds like that&#39;s impossible. Like the human body can only run so far because it needs water, it needs food, it needs rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t know. I think part of the philosophy of the book is that we&#39;re limited by our belief in that and that in fact this tribe don&#39;t have that belief, therefore they don&#39;t have those limits. They kinda surpassed those limits simply by they just do it. Nobody told them they couldn&#39;t so they...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  They just do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Nobody told them they needed a pair of, you know, hundred dollar shoes in order to run. They just run, it&#39;s like it&#39;s a natural human thing and it&#39;s like an atavistic thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  You know humans, we can run down gazelle, we can run faster than hor..., I mean we can run further than horses and these creatures, creatures that we think have a running ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Are you sure about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Absolutely, yeah, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve never, I&#39;ve never heard that before that...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s why, you know people who, it&#39;s quite dangerous to run with a dog for example. People who run and take the dogs because dogs can&#39;t run as far as humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah. And dogs can&#39;t sweat. Humans can run and run and run for days, that&#39;s how they, that&#39;s how they killed prey when we were in the cave.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Before we gave up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  No, you can outrun an antelope because an antelope can only have short sharp bursts of speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  But a pack of humans can run down any animal on the planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s good to know. If I ever need to kill an antelope...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Well yeah obviously you can&#39;t just, you know, stick your shoes on and set off and...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, good stuff though. So, but would you like to try it some day, try one of these ultra marathons?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s good to have a goal but I like training for these kind of things and ultra marathon, I just mentally, I don&#39;t know I have that ability to run for that far and that long. I&#39;d like to have, yeah, I&#39;d like to try and develop that stamina.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I think we, maybe in my younger days but...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t think you do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Or in another life but...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m gonna pass.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I think that running actually requires a lot of maturity so the older you get the better you are at running because you give up on stuff when you are young and your brain&#39;s quite, you know, you can&#39;t concentrate. You learn concentration and discipline and they
  <span class="audionotes">
   come with age
  </span>
  and maturity so I think we get better runners as we get older. That&#39;s what I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   banking on
  </span>
  anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, me too. I got that on my side.
