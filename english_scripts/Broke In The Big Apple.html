  Todd:
 </strong>
 So Kevin, I thought we would talk about money today, and you have many interesting stories about being
 <span class="audionotes">
  broke
 </span>
 .
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yes.  I have been broke a number of times.  Anything in particular that you would like to hear?  I&#39;ve got
  <span class="audionotes">
   quite a bunch
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So tell me when was the first time you were really broke?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  The first time I was really broke was, I was 19, and I moved to New York City.  I followed a girl that I met in Glacier National Park, I was working out there as a singing waiter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Went out to New York, followed her, and I
  <span class="audionotes">
   ended up
  </span>
  living in an apartment with three other people and the share of my rent was $500 a month.  Now that was 20 years ago, and $500 a month 20 years ago to a 19 year old kid with no education, no experience... that was a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I worked three jobs.  I worked from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. at the George Washington Street Bus Terminal and subway station
  <span class="audionotes">
   handing out flyers
  </span>
  , American Express Moneygram flyers, then I would take the subway to Midtown, to FAO Schwartz, you know the big toy store...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh yeah, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  ...from the movie, &#34;Big&#34;...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s really famous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  ...where he dances on the piano.  Yeah, and I was... I would wrap presents there.  And then I would work there from 11 to 4, and then I would take the subway back down to
  <span class="audionotes">
   The Village
  </span>
  where I was living, and I would work from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. as a waiter and bus boy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   That&#39;s brutal
  </span>
  .  That&#39;s pretty harsh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s really brutal.  Well, how I ended up being broke was, the restaurant was a New Orleans style restaurant, and I got fired for talking to the customers too much.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Truth is
  </span>
  , the customers were interested in the fact that I was from New Orleans and it was a New Orleans style restaurant.  And for... I lasted two more months.  And I only had enough money everyday to buy a slice of cheese pizza and a pack of cigarettes.  And...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  One slice of pizza and a pack of cigarettes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Well, and a Hostess Fruit Pie lunch.  But one time, during lunchtime at FAO Schwartz, I went down to the vending machine and I got my Hostess Fruit Pie and I took a bite in it and it was hollow.  There was no fruit in it and I really had a small
  <span class="audionotes">
   panic attack
  </span>
  , and I called the
  <span class="audionotes">
   toll free number
  </span>
  on it, and I complained, &#34;You just don&#39;t understand how much of my
  <span class="audionotes">
   daily nutritional intake
  </span>
  that pie represented&#34;, and all he did was apologize and I was hoping they would send me a case of pies, but they didn&#39;t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No such luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.  When I went home, I was probably about 30 pounds lighter than before I left.  And I was really poor.  So that&#39;s the first time I was really broke.
