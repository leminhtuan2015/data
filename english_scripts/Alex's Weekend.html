  Katia
 </strong>
 : Hey, Alex.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Hi, Katia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Listen, I just have a question. What do you like doing during the weekends?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : During the weekends? Well usually I like mountain biking. That&#39;s one of my hobbies so whenever I&#39;ve got time and the weather is fine, I like taking my bike and going somewhere. Sometimes I go far and sometimes not that far but I like doing that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : That is so cool. Do you usually go alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Well
  <span class="audionotes">
   whenever
  </span>
  I have friends or I have someone to go with I try to go but most of the times I go alone, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s cool. What about during the mornings or in the evenings, what do you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Well if I can get out, go somewhere with my friends, I always try to go drinking or I try to go have dinner or something. Usually when I&#39;m at home, I try to get together with my family. My mom likes cooking and likes having everybody over so sometimes my cousins come, my grandparents too, so that&#39;s one of the things I do when I&#39;m home. When I&#39;m not then I try to meet my friends. Sometimes I
  <span class="audionotes">
   invite my friends over
  </span>
  , I cook for them,
  <span class="audionotes">
   nothing more
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : What about Saturday night? Do you go to a restaurant or to a bar?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I love going to restaurants and bars but I really don&#39;t enjoy going to discos or clubs. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not such a big fan of that. I like going downtown like, yeah, meeting my friends, going to bars, talking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : So you don&#39;t like
  <span class="audionotes">
   crowded places
  </span>
  or loud music?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s really not about crowded places or loud music, it&#39;s more that I enjoy being with my friends and I enjoy being able to talk and to say things and when I go to those places, you know like there are so many people that you don&#39;t really get to talk to people, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t enjoy that much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : During the weekends do you usually or sometimes go out of town or on a trip?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I do. I do and I love going to places but that&#39;s really when the weather is nice and I&#39;ve got some time. If the weather is not so nice then I&#39;d rather just stay home because I kind of like
  <span class="audionotes">
   resting
  </span>
  . Usually during the weeks I&#39;m kind of busy but if the weather is nice and I&#39;ve got time and I can go with friends or something, I do that. I don&#39;t enjoy going somewhere in the weekends just by myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Nice.
