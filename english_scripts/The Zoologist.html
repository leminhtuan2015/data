   Ana
  </strong>
  : Hey, Michael. I heard your mom is a
  <span class="audionotes">
   zoologist
  </span>
  . What is it exactly?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : A zoologist. Well, that&#39;s true. She is a zoologist. So a zoologist is someone who studies animals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Oh, interesting. So does she study all animals or does she
  <span class="audionotes">
   focus on
  </span>
  a specific animal?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Well, she&#39;s worked at universities studying animals for a long time. So she&#39;s worked on many different kinds of animals. But at the moment, she is studying South African tortoises.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Oh, interesting. Do you have any
  <span class="audionotes">
   tortoises
  </span>
  in your house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Actually, we have more than 40 tortoises in our garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : More than 40. Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Yes. People are always very surprised when they visit and they see all our tortoises.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : So, do you know a lot about tortoises as well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t know very much about them but I mean, my mom has always got them around at the house or she&#39;s often busy with some sort of tortoise&#39;s related activity. And so sometimes, as a high school kid, I got home and she would have a tortoise that â€“ a pregnant tortoise, a female tortoise with eggs inside. And in order to
  <span class="audionotes">
   monitor
  </span>
  these eggs, she would have it in a bath of water with an
  <span class="audionotes">
   ultrasound scanner
  </span>
  and a screen up on the dining room table.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Wow. That is really interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : I had a very interesting childhood with all of these animals and things around the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s great. Did you have any other pets?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Yes. We&#39;ve always had a couple of dogs and I like cats. So I&#39;ve got my pet cat at home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Wow. That&#39;s really interesting.
