  Hi, this is Tara. I&#39;m going to talk about Tokyo.
  <span class="audiodef">
   All in all
  </span>
  , I&#39;ve been in Tokyo now for about a year and three months, and I really love it here. Sometimes I
  <span class="audiodef">
   find it hard
  </span>
  because the culture is so different from where I am from, but I find the people really friendly and once you
  <span class="audiodef">
   make Japanese friends
  </span>
  they will really
  <span class="audiodef">
   help you out
  </span>
  with whatever you&#39;re doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I work in the
  <span class="audiodef">
   evenings
  </span>
  so it&#39;s quite exciting for me to see, you know live in a big city and always see the nightlife. I do dancing here. I&#39;ve had a lot of good experiences in Tokyo, some of the best times of my life, so, yeah, I&#39;d like to stay here a bit longer, especially because I like looking at Japanese boys.
