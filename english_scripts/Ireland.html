   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Shane, you&#39;re from Ireland.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shane:
  </strong>
  I am, indeed, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Where are you from in Ireland?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shane:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from a small town about 30 miles away from Dublin called Anfield, where there is plenty of cows and farmers and those type of things, so it&#39;s a good place. Lots of green fields. No mountians. Very small town you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  I&#39;d say there is about maybe 2,000 people living there, but I actually live outside the town so I live, a sort of
  <span class="audiodef">
   bungalow house
  </span>
  and it&#39;s sort of far away from the town so, that where I&#39;m living, or that&#39;s where I was living, I was living in Dublin though, the capital but I originally from about, a sort of
  <span class="audiodef">
   rural town
  </span>
  you might say.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What is the best thing about your town?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shane:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a very
  <span class="audiodef">
   close-knit community
  </span>
  , so if you go into a bar or a pub everyone seems to know each other. You know so whether, you have young people who
  <span class="audiodef">
   interact
  </span>
  with people who are 50 or 60 years of age, and there&#39;s people playing football and all that stuff, there is lots of interaction between people, so everyone
  <span class="audiodef">
   seems to know each other
  </span>
  .
