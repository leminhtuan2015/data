  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Buddihini, today we&#39;re going to talk about roles and family: traditional roles or what people do. Now in Sri Lanka, is it common for usually the women to do all the cooking?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   It was so
  </span>
  . It was so, but still
  <span class="audionotes">
   the mentality is such
  </span>
  that they expect the daughters and the wives to do the kitchen stuff and the cleaning, the laundry and all that, but we do have a lot of working mothers now and they are many single parents as well so the culture has been changing a little bit, but still the majority is that women should do the usual household stuff and the men do the work outside and get the money. If it&#39;s like the cityside, and if the wife is also working, obviously it&#39;s not expected that the wife ends up doing everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what happens? Do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   split the duties
  </span>
  or do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   hire a servant
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  Yes, hiring some helper is quite common in Sri Lanka. I personally don&#39;t agree with that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really, you don&#39;t want to have like a cook or a maid or anything like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi
  </strong>
  : It&#39;ll be nice to have but I wouldn&#39;t want to have. I want to do my things on my own. I think it&#39;s easier to do things on your own, and I&#39;d make sure when I get married that I have the correct partner who&#39;d want to help me out with things and having kids and all that. I wouldn&#39;t want somebody else to come and help us out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, when you get married, you&#39;d like to split the duties with your husband?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you expect your husband to cook and clean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  At least help me out and make sure that he knows what I&#39;m doing.
  <span class="audionotes">
   He values what I do
  </span>
  cause I&#39;m definitely not the kind who&#39;ll stay at home and do only the household stuff. I&#39;ll definitely go out and get the money as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you want to be
  <span class="audionotes">
   the bread winner
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  I wouldn&#39;t say that. We will share. I mean, why he suffer alone, and why I suffer alone at home. We suffer together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now is this a common viewpoint with most young women from your country?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;d say so. I&#39;d say so, but there are many people who don&#39;t like to go out and be a working mom. They&#39;d rather prefer staying at home and you know, waiting for their husband to come home in the evening or stuff like that, but I&#39;m definitely not that kind.
