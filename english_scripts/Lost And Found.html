  I&#39;m going to talk a little bit about an embarrassing situation. In Japan, I&#39;ve lost my wallet four times. The first time I lost my wallet I was in a taxi cab going home late at night and my wallet slipped out of my pocket and I didn&#39;t notice. The second time I lost my wallet I went to a night club with my friends and I drank to much and I wasn&#39;t paying attention and I left my wallet on the counter of the bar. The third time I lost my wallet I was hiking in a mountain region in Japan and I went into a small convenience store on the way home and I bought an ice-cream and I left my wallet on the counter and forgot about it. The fourth time I lost my wallet I was in Ueno station, a really, really busy station in Tokyo and I left my wallet on the counter at a supermarket, and the most amzing thing is that I still have the same wallet. In each of these instances I got my wallet back. In two of the cases the person at the store called me and I just had to go back to the store and get it. In one instance, the person that ran the convenient store in the mountains mailed me my wallet, and another time I had to go to the police station and pick it up, but I think that says a lot about Japanese people. They&#39;re very, very honest and sometimes I think maybe Japan is the only country in the world where you could lose your wallet four times and still get it back.
