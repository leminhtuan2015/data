  : Hey Kat, you were just telling me about all the pros and cons of different renewable energies and you just got me thinking we&#39;re going to run out of oil in the next couple of decades. There&#39;s reports that say we&#39;re going to run out of oil in the next twenty years, but I&#39;m guessing that in fifty years or a hundred years we really will run out and we&#39;ll need some sort of other energy source. What do you think&#39;s going to happen?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kat
  </strong>
  : I think it&#39;s going to be a combination of all the renewable energy sources we have right now, but there&#39;s a lot of development going on especially into solar energy. Solar panels are becoming
  <span class="audionotes">
   more and more
  </span>
  efficient. There&#39;s now solar panels that are flexible and you can actually bend them around objects and the newest ones are actually made by biodegradable materials and they start to be see-through so you can actually apply solar energy harvesting tools to windows and I think that might be the future of renewable energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matthew
  </strong>
  : What about as far as cost performance goes and
  <a href="../../ANA/AN/1101/1106-A3-sustainability.mp3">
   sustainability
  </a>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kat
  </strong>
  : Well when it comes to sustainability, I think these new forms of solar panels that are made of biodegradable material, I think they are definitely going to be the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matthew
  </strong>
  : It seems like it&#39;s a lot of resources. We use a lot of energy every day. Every person uses a lot of energy every day. Do you think that there&#39;s going to be a time where all houses are run by renewable energy? Do we have the space, the capacity on this planet to actually fit every household with solar panels or wind energies?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kat
  </strong>
  : Well as far as the resources go as how much solar energy actually hits our planet, we can provide energy for the world a thousand times over. That is not a problem but I think financially it&#39;s going to be very difficult. At the situation we are at right now, I think it won&#39;t be possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matthew
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m sure that scientists are going to figure out something but I just think solar panels, wind turbines, everything, they actually use plastics and metals and in order to produce those you need oil. Now if you have
  <a href="../../ANA/AN/1101/1106-A4-zero.mp3">
   zero
  </a>
  oil, how are you going to produce these renewable energy resource products?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kat
  </strong>
  : I have been trying to explain that earlier with biodegradable materials. There&#39;s actually solar panels being built from renewable materials themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Matthew
  </strong>
  : You&#39;re in the industry, you&#39;ve been working there for a while and I am just wanting to ask you do you think that it&#39;s going to be successful? Will there be renewable energy throughout the globe or are people going to be too stubborn?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kat
  </strong>
  : Well
  <a href="../../ANA/AN/1101/1106-A5-as-the-situation-stands.mp3">
   as the situation stands
  </a>
  right now, renewable energy will not be able to take care of our energy needs and I truly hope that there will be scientific discoveries in the next fifty years because as it is right now we will not be able to go on as we are just supported by renewable energy.
