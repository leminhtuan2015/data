   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Eli, can you talk a little about England and maybe about it&#39;s climate and it&#39;s weather, it&#39;s leaders, what people eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m not going to talk about leaders right now because that&#39;s a bit of a sore point but England weather, hmm, that is a bit of a sore point to. It&#39;s not the greatest weather in the world, especially compared to Japan where I am now, which the weather I just love. England is always cold, almost always cold even through the summer it&#39;s quite cold I hear. This summer it&#39;s been sort of jacket weather all summer with only a few days of sunshine and it rains a lot, so it&#39;s pretty miserable as far as weather&#39;s concerned.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, you&#39;re from Bristol right. What&#39;s your hometown like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  Bristol&#39;s a great town. I used to live in London which is the capital of England and it&#39;s very gray and big and unfriendly but when I moved to Bristol it was just great. It is a city but it&#39;s a very small city so you can always bump into your friends, um, always meet people. It&#39;s got big green areas. It&#39;s got a place called the downs which is a big park, and it&#39;s the architecture of the city is very old. It&#39;s very near Bath, which is a very famous old Roman town, where the Roman baths were, so all the sort of architecture of the city
  <br>
  the houses, all of it&#39;s very pretty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What are the Downs like? You said the downs. Is that a park?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  The downs. It&#39;s, it&#39;s a big area of green basically. It&#39;s not a park as in lots of trees and trees and sort of shrubbery and stuff. It&#39;s just a big wide spread of greenery where you can play football. I mean there&#39;s
  <br>
  football matches sort of every week. You can go fly your kites. You can take your kids there. And that joins on to the Avon-gorge, which is where the Bristol suspension bridge is, which is very famous as being I think the first ever suspension bridge built, and from standing on the bridge and looking out into the gorge, I mean you&#39;d think you&#39;re in the middle of the mountains, not in the middle of the city. It&#39;s a really pretty area.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sounds like a nice place.
