  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Eli, you&#39;re young and you&#39;re into Manga, so I take it you like video games?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  Mm-hm, I do very much. It&#39;s my other hobby. Um, almost an obsession sometimes. I think my friends get quite worried about me sometimes, the amount I play, but yeah I&#39;ve always since I&#39;ve been little liked computer games. I think my dad on his old macintosh forced us into it originally, so I blame it all on him, but that sort of developed into obviously in my field that I do which is animation. It&#39;s very close connected to it, and I&#39;d like to maybe work making computer games one day, uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s a really good game? What do you think is the best game?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  My favorite games are I think a split between two, the Final Fantasy series, which is a spread of lots of different games which are RPG which are role playing games, where you are, you&#39;re a character, or party of characters and you run around talking to people, discovering things, fighting battles, lots and lots of puzzles, lots of secrets. That&#39;s what I like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is the setting now or the future or the past?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  The setting&#39;s always in some fantasy world, but you don&#39;t know about. That&#39;s kind of, that&#39;s one of the nice things about computer games, it&#39;s almost escapism. You can escape the reality of the real world and go and run around in some fantastical world I mean, now that the graphics and computer games are getting so advanced it really does feel like your going into a new world of your own actually,and that you&#39;re there running around, so yeah, that&#39;s great and I think my other favorite game would have to be the SIMS series, which is,
  <br>
  started with SIM city, which is a little city building game, where you&#39;re the mayor of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re the mayor!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re the mayor of the city and you have to build up your city over hundreds of years and advance it, and then from that they made the SIMs which actually goes into the houses and you control the lives of the little SIM people in the houses. It&#39;s almost like playing dolls houses, but very, very advanced and they have their own wants and needs and they fall in love and they go to work and it&#39;s basically just determining the destinies of your little character and furnishing their houses at the same time, which is always fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, what a game! So actually, shows how old I am, you said, &#34;computer games!&#34; So you don&#39;t say video games anymore?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  Well, the SIMS and SIM City, I mean the first SIM City series I played on, probably the Mac had only just got a hard drive, um, really old when I was about, sort of seven or eight, even younger than that, so yeah, those PC games, mac games, and also video games, video games are Play Station, the ones that you play on the TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Which to you prefer a play station or an actual arcade game to play on?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  Uh, I never actually got into arcade games, cause you got to put money in to play them so, and I don&#39;t
  <br>
  think my, our parents ever wanted us to sort of waste money like that so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What kind of player do you have: a play station?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  I have a play station, and a Dreamcast, and an X box, and a Game Cube, and an N64 and a Gameboy
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, I don&#39;t even know what those are.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eli:
  </strong>
  And a PC!

  I can&#39;t remember what this toy was called but I had this very interesting, basically it was, like a robot car you could program in how forward you wanted it to go and then, when it would stop and after it would stopped, if it was going to make a right turn or a left turn, and you could also make it go backwards or in
  <span class="audionotes">
   diagonal
  </span>
  , and it was very fun. You could set it up in your house or outside and try to program in directions so that it would follow a path, so you could try to make it go from the living room and take a left into the kitchen and stop just before it ran into your mom, and back up before she kicked it and
  <span class="audionotes">
   yelled
  </span>
  at you, or make it turn around in circles. I think it also had some sounds you could make, but it&#39;s very interesting to think back that, that kind of technology existed, you know, in the late 80&#39;s, early 1980&#39;s, too. Of course, everybody&#39;s favorite when I was a kid anyway, even today, are video games, not only home video games but the
  <span class="audionotes">
   arcade style
  </span>
  games. I was a, I was a good kid but I can remember of the few times that I
  <span class="audionotes">
   got in trouble
  </span>
  with my dad was because I ended up at a arcade, and I was playing video games for so long and I didn&#39;t call home and ended up coming home very late and that was very upsetting to my parents and they were worried about me. Also, it seemed like the kids in school that were most popular were the kids who had video games at their houses. I didn&#39;t have a video game at my house so I always had to find friends and
  <span class="audionotes">
   go over to
  </span>
  their house to play.

 <strong>
  Lindsay:
 </strong>
 So, since we are talking about technology, I have a question for you. Is there any gadget or technology that you&#39;re really addicted to?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  That would have to be video games. I have pretty much every video game console that was releases since the late 80&#39;s.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Are you serious?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yes. Every one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Wow. I actually don&#39;t really like video games.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Why not? They&#39;re fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. I used to when I was a kid, but recently
  <span class="audionotes">
   they just don&#39;t appeal to me
  </span>
  ... to sit in front and like, use my thumb to press this thing to make it jump and I guess I&#39;m just not very good at them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, they&#39;re getting more and
  <span class="audionotes">
   more involving now
  </span>
  , it&#39;s kind of like having an interactive movie except you get to be the main character in the movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess. I need to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get used to it
  </span>
  . I&#39;m really bad at them right now, so I&#39;m just not comfortable with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I know what you mean. One thing I&#39;ve noticed a lot with games lately is that they&#39;re so complicated to control that you have to be like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   hard core gamer
  </span>
  to even begin to understand how to play the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Do you think you&#39;re a hard core gamer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  I would have to say I am though
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m not exactly proud of it
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. What
  <span class="audionotes">
   constitutes
  </span>
  a hard core gamer? How often to you play?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Pretty much, well, probably for most hard core gamers, it would be every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Every day. How many hours?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  An hour or two, at the least.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  OK, what about you? How often do you play every day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, since, I&#39;m working, there are lots of days when I don&#39;t play at all, and I would like to be able to play more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  OK, so one of your goals in life is to play more video games?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  No, I wouldn&#39;t say that but it&#39;s a good way to relax and sometimes it&#39;s more fun than just watching TV when you have nothing better to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  OK, so you play... try to play every day but sometimes you don&#39;t and then, are there any tips you can give me to become a good video gamer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, just the more you can play, the better you&#39;ll get. I don&#39;t necessarily want to play more because as you know there isn&#39;t really any reward for playing games more.
 </p>
