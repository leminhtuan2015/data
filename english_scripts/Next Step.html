  George:
 </strong>
 Where are you working these days?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m working at the restaurant around the station.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s it like working in a restaurant?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s ... busy times are busy, but boring sometimes. It&#39;s just usual work: washing dishes, serving and then that it&#39;s pretty much.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Not a big deal
  </span>
  job. I really like it, but at the same time I&#39;m looking for more. I think I should look for a desk job or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Oh,
  <span class="audionotes">
   a desk job
  </span>
  !
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. Maybe I could work at a ... maybe a clothing store.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Oh, really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I do enjoy fashion, and I need to
  <span class="audionotes">
   update my wardrobe
  </span>
  , so a little discount would be nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  I hear that there&#39;s a opening at Bloomingdale&#39;s.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Oh, awesome!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  You should give it a try.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Maybe. But then again I&#39;m not a very ... I&#39;m not really
  <span class="audionotes">
   a people person
  </span>
  , though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  A people person! What do you mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I can&#39;t just go up to new people and start talking to them. It&#39;s a little difficult for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Well, on my point of view, I think that&#39;s a little ... sometimes I think that&#39;s sort of a little annoying. One time like this lady at the market, she just started talking me, &#34;Oh, this looks good on you!&#34; OK, I don&#39;t need that. You know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Yes, they use some very strong
  <span class="audionotes">
   mind tricks
  </span>
  to get you to buy things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Well, you&#39;re good with mind tricks aren&#39;t you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m good at
  <span class="audionotes">
   being played
  </span>
  by mind tricks, but now good at doing mind tricks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Aye! Well, I guess you still have nine months left.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s a little depressing though.
