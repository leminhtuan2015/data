   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Tara, I see you&#39;ve just bought a new guitar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tara:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I have, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tara:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s very nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what&#39;s the
  <span class="audiodef">
   reasoning behind
  </span>
  buying a guitar?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tara:
  </strong>
  Well, I work at nights so I have the daytime free, and
  <span class="audiodef">
   to be honest
  </span>
  , most people they work in the day so I&#39;m often
  <span class="audiodef">
   on my own
  </span>
  , and I just want something to keep me entertained in the daytime, and I don&#39;t really like reading books, so I want something to do with my hands, so I thought buying a guitar is a good idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you have any kind of music you would like to sing or learn to play?
 </p>

   Tara:
  </strong>
  I&#39;d like to learn, have you heard, there&#39;s some English bands, like Cold Play and Turn Break so I&#39;d like to learn that kind of style.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Do you plan to
  <span class="audiodef">
   take lessons
  </span>
  or just learn on your own?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tara:
  </strong>
  No, well a couple of my friends, they you know, they can, they learned guitar as well. I can&#39;t really take lessons in Japan. I think that might be
  <span class="audiodef">
   a bit too much
  </span>
  , but my friends are going to teach me. Hopefully. Yeah!
