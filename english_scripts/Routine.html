   Hi, I&#39;m Mike and this is my daily routine. I get up early every day, around 6:30 and I go to the gym for a
   <span class="audionotes">
    work-out
   </span>
   before I go to work. I usually do aerobic exercise for awhile and then do some
   <span class="audionotes">
    weightlifting
   </span>
   for maybe half an hour at the gym, then I&#39;ll return home, and as I work from my home, I turn on my computer and start working on
   <span class="audionotes">
    what needs to be done
   </span>
   . I usually skip breakfast and I&#39;ll work until about 12:00 then I&#39;ll prepare lunch and have a fairly big lunch because I don&#39;t eat breakfast. Then after lunch, I&#39;ll go back, continue working on Internet or whatever I have to do for work, until about 6:00 when I usually start getting phone calls from friends of mine who
   <span class="audionotes">
    live abroad
   </span>
   and then in the evenings if I&#39;m not using my time doing things with the Internet or surfing the web, then I&#39;m speaking to people on the Internet or on my phone and that pretty much
   <span class="audionotes">
    sums up
   </span>
   my usual daily routine.
