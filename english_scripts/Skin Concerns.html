  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Rebecca, talking about your country, I hear that skin cancer is a serious problem in Australia?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is. I think our environment is the cause of it
  <span class="audionotes">
   in a way
  </span>
  because we do have the beautiful beaches that you always want to go out and swim and be in the sun, have the barbecue, so you&#39;re outside a lot, especially during the time of the day that it is really quite stong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so is the government doing anything, or do people do anything to try to prevent it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the government&#39;s put out the slogan, &#34;
  <span class="audionotes">
   Slip, slop, and slap
  </span>
  &#34; so slip on some sun screen, slap on a hat, and yeah, something along those lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, it works, right. Is skin cancer cases going down?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I think the deaths from skin cancer are going down. The number of cases of skin cancer that are increasing still, maybe it&#39;s because they can check and see if you&#39;re going to get it earlier than what they used to, but, yeah they&#39;re able to sort of reduce the cases a bit, which is great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So have this changed the culture? Are people less wanting to be tan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t think so. There&#39;s a lot of products coming out on the market now where you get the tanning products, so I suppose they&#39;re helping you tan
  <span class="audionotes">
   in a way
  </span>
  that&#39;s not putting you out in the sun, but yeah, it&#39;s just the culture is to get outside and enjoy the sun. You do see down on the beach, everyone laying down on the beach,
  <span class="audionotes">
   sun baking
  </span>
  , enjoying the sun, but I think more so now, you see that they are putting on sun screen too, which is really good to hear.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what about you? Are you somebody who tans very easily?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I am. I suppose, I&#39;m the lucky few people that don&#39;t have to sit out in the sun
  <span class="audionotes">
   for ages
  </span>
  to tan, but I do still like to put on the sun screen a lot. Every time I go outside I make sure I got it on. Especially, around the ears and nose. They tend to be major parts that skin cancer can form now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, yeah, it&#39;s winter right now and you still look pretty tan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Ah, thank you.
