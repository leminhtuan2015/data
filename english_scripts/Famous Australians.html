 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>

  <strong>
   Nick:

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve never actually heard of him. How old is he?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s 24 years old I think. 24 or 25. So he&#39;s really young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  I see. You guys are really famous for athletics.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Athletics, yeah. There&#39;s another famous person by the name of Cathy Freeman.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Cathy Freeman.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  She&#39;s the first
  <span class="audionotes">
   aboriginal
  </span>
  Australian to win a gold medal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Ah, aboriginal Australian.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so native Australian.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  What did she win a gold medal in?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  In the 400 meters sprint.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Oh, the sprint, so she&#39;s a runner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Yeah, she&#39;s a runner, so yeah, she&#39;d been doing it for for
  <span class="audionotes">
   years and years
  </span>
  , but finally she had that
  <span class="audionotes">
   big break-through
  </span>
  and did very well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Is she the first aboriginal woman to win something, or is she is she the first aboriginal period?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Well, many aboriginal have won events but never really at a world stage so it was really impressive to see her win the even and then she took the aboriginal flag onto the ground and did a
  <span class="audionotes">
   lap of honor
  </span>
  for the aboriginal Australians.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Very nice. What year was that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  That was the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Ah, perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  So in Australia so it was really, really a special moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Very special since it was held in her own land.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Yeah, exactly and Sydney&#39;s a very important place for aboriginals as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Why is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Because that&#39;s where the first fleet arrived from England was to Sydney, so that was the first, I suppose, invasion of Australia came through Sydney, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, I remember seeing that in the movie &#34;Australia&#34;.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, you would have too. It was in Australia so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess other country&#39;s also have aborigines people. I&#39;m thinking of Taiwan and another island not too far from Australia. Well, I think Taiwan have the aborigines. One really famous aborigines there is Ah Mae. She is a very famous singer. She&#39;s been called the Diva of Asia because of her voice. She has a really, really, really talented
  <span class="audionotes">
   vocal range
  </span>
  . Really high and really low. And she was famous also for being native Taiwanese. The aboriginal Taiwanese.
