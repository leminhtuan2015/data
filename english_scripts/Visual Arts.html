   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now Jason, you&#39;re an artist.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right, yep.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What kind of artist are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  I draw all sorts of things, but mostly I like to draw on the computer, using photoshop.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Things like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, was it hard to learn?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Oh, not really. It&#39;s just
  <span class="audiodef">
   practice
  </span>
  . You know if you
  <span class="audiodef">
   feel
  </span>
  like you want to draw one day, that means you&#39;re an artist I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, I didn&#39;t even know that, I mean I do pictures for the web site, but I didn&#39;t know you could draw on the computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, that&#39;s right. I&#39;ve made my own web site as well, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Cool. OK, what&#39;s the web site address?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason: Â www.geocities.com/replicated280781
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  A bit of a
  <span class="audiodef">
   mouthful
  </span>
  though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;ll have to write that one down. That&#39;s pretty tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  No worries. OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So when people go to your web site what can they see?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Not a hell of a lot but I did draw everything on there myself, every button every single piece of graphic you see on there I drew, just photographs of me, my friends,
  <span class="audiodef">
   drawings
  </span>
  that I&#39;ve done and posted up and not really much else, but it&#39;s good if you just want to check it out. Check some photos out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  &#39;m sure it&#39;s great. Actually I&#39;m going to
  <span class="audiodef">
   check it out
  </span>
  later tonight. So, I&#39;ll link it from my web page to your web page
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is it OK if people write you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Sure. Not a problem. Not a problem. I&#39;d enjoy it.
