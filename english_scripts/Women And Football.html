  Valeria:
 </strong>
 How about women? How do they live football, soccer?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Well recently they are getting more and more into football and if you go to the stadium you can see more and more women come in and once they get into football it&#39;s really common to see them at the stadium for example. So and it&#39;s really nice because it used to be a kind of activity just for men, like supporting teams, knowing about football, going to the stadium but now it&#39;s more like you get a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   couples
  </span>
  there and you get a lot of families so I think it&#39;s a good point that women are getting more and more involved. So are you
  <span class="audionotes">
   involved
  </span>
  in football, are you into football?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Actually, I&#39;m kind of a weird case for my country because I&#39;m not very interested in soccer but still I know when there is a match, about the result and I have my favorite team as well but I don&#39;t watch the match but I&#39;m very, very weird.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m not the rule
  </span>
  at all.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m kind of the exception
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  So basically in Argentina women would be interested in football?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Women are like this, the same as in Chile, they are getting more and more involved with soccer. In the past it was like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   social activity
  </span>
  that you are a woman and you are with your family, your father, your brother, your boyfriend, your husband and you shared the moment and now more and more they are, I mean women are playing soccer, going to the stadium or we can see like girls meeting for watching the match.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s good.
