  : How many classes do you have in the morning?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : When I get home I&#39;m usually really tired, so I get changed into my pajamas and I watch TV for about two hours. After that, I&#39;ll maybe have some dinner, maybe get a pizza and then read a book or play on my phone again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What do you watch on TV?
 </p>
 <p>

  </strong>
  : Do you listen to K-pop?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : A little bit but I think it&#39;s a little bit boring. I prefer American pop.
