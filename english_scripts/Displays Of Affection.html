  Cheryl:
 </strong>
 So, Nick, let&#39;s talk about touching and holding hands and physical touch with your significant other. Do you and your partner hold hands when you go out in the street?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  We hold hands all the time. Initially, we ... when we first
  <span class="audionotes">
   went out
  </span>
  , holding hands was the first thing we did, and then progressively moved on from there to kissing, but holding hands was certainly the first thing we did in our relationship.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Do you remember when you first tried to hold her hand, or did she try to hold your hand first?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  I made the first move. We were sitting on the couch watching a movie, and I was getting a bit nervous, and I couldn&#39;t quite concentrate on the movie, so I moved my hand over to hers, and she
  <span class="audionotes">
   reciprocated
  </span>
  , and it moved on from there, so ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  You know, that&#39;s funny that you
  <span class="audionotes">
   bring that up
  </span>
  because on of the most common moves that is made fun of in movies as well is when the guy takes a big yawn, a fake yawn, and he opens his arms wide and places it around the girl&#39;s shoulder, and thus embraces her, but he had to do it because he yawned.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  My experience, like my first hug was like that as well, so it was just a bit of an excuse for us reaching for something, and then suddenly my hand went around, and she didn&#39;t mind so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s very good. And what about kissing? Do you kiss a lot in public, in the streets?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Rarely in public, cause we find it makes other people uncomfortable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true. I find that when I see couples kissing, or
  <span class="audionotes">
   making out
  </span>
  in public, I usually think to myself,
  <span class="audionotes">
   Why don&#39;t you get a room?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you don&#39;t want to see that. You just want to be having a conversation with them or ... you don&#39;t want them to be constantly distracted.
