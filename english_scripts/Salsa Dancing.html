  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Katia and Fred, we&#39;re talking about your dance school, and before we were talking about the belly dance, and Katia you do the belly dance, but you also do Salsa.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right, Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And that takes two?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  That takes two.
  <span class="style6">
   It takes two to salsa
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It takes two to salsa. So you are part of the salsa team?

  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yes. If we could call it a team, I mean,
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s mostly Katia teaching me how to dance and then I try to
  <span class="audionotes">
   pass it on
  </span>
  to the others.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s not true. Fred... Fred is a very good teacher, I think he&#39;s just very humble but where I think we make a very good team: We&#39;re both patient and we know what a student is struggling and that&#39;s the important part.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  And it&#39;s also good to have partners like this to teach other people, whether they&#39;re partners or not, or they just want to learn salsa, like the men would come to me to learn about a special move and then the women would
  <span class="audionotes">
   have a tendency
  </span>
  of going more towards Katia so we&#39;re making...
  <span class="audionotes">
   striking a perfect balance
  </span>
  in teaching, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, do you get a fair balance of students, of male to female students, for salsa class?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Right now, we have more women than men so hopefully we&#39;ll have a balance in there, but yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  I guess women are
  <span class="audionotes">
   more open towards
  </span>
  taking dance lessons than men are. Maybe men feel a bit scared. I don&#39;t know. How do you feel, Todd? Would you come to the school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, you know what, I will. I will come, but I have to admit my feeling would be that I would be intimidated. That I would look really foolish, so yeah. I think most guys would probably feel the same way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s why we have more girls I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Unfortunately, but the truth is from what I&#39;ve heard from the guys, from the men, they do want to learn how to dance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it does sound fun. It does.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  And women also like it. Women like for the men to dance, and especially in Salsa, usually it&#39;s the man is the leader,so it&#39;s very important that the man is who leads.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That sounds like more pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  No, no, no. Well, you learn how to be a good leader and how to lead, and the woman how to follow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, let&#39;s say somebody goes to your school, like myself and they have
  <span class="audionotes">
   two left feet
  </span>
  . They cannot dance. How long does it take to where you can do a salsa reasonably well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  We... right from the beginning, at least we can a little bit, where the person is and does it, can they hear the music or not. From the first class, you dance with a partner. Of course not freely. We can tell you what steps to take. And we advance accordingly, so it might take in one step, it might take a long time, so it depends on people that are in the class, and it all depends on the person.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. So some people learn faster than others.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  But definitely after one class, you will have learned a minimum two steps
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Guaranteed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sold. I&#39;ll definitely come and try it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Please do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Please do.

 <strong>
  Jana:
 </strong>
 Hey, Peter, are you interested in dancing by any chance?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I do. I like dancing. Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s great. Well there is a salsa class in Oita City tomorrow night and a few of us are going but it&#39;s mainly we have a group of girls, five girls, so we need some guys to
  <span class="audionotes">
   come along
  </span>
  so I was wondering if you would like to come?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Sounds interesting but will I be the only guy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Oh no, there are other people who come along but because it&#39;s four of us from the university we thought
  <span class="audionotes">
   it would be nice if
  </span>
  we get some more people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  OK. It sounds interesting. What kind of class is it, how does it work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Well it sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   varies
  </span>
  but the teacher comes in once a month and teaches different styles, salsa or merengue, a different Latin dance. Have you ever tried?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve tried I guess in different places but never been taught before or I&#39;ve never really been shown how to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  So you would already be an expert?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know about that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Well don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s a really basic level but the teacher will show us some basic steps and then we&#39;ll practice in pairs and you dance with different people. It&#39;s quite a lot of fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  OK. What time does it start?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  It starts around six thirty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  And how long does it
  <span class="audionotes">
   last
  </span>
  for?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Usually the class
  <span class="audionotes">
   goes on for
  </span>
  about an hour and there is free social dancing afterwards so you can stay longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  And practice, have a drink.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  It sounds quite nice. Do I have to wear anything special or have...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  No, just whatever you&#39;re comfortable in. Some people wear or girls wear special shoes I guess but you don&#39;t have to worry, just something comfortable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  So shoes, any shoes are fine?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Any shoes, yeah, any shoes are fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  OK. It sounds pretty nice actually. So does it cost anything, do I have to prepare money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s ten dollars per lesson and you get a free drink with that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  OK. Free drink, that sounds good. Where are you guys meeting, which station?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  We can meet at Oita station. It&#39;s only about a ten minute walk from there so maybe we can meet around six fifteen?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  OK. That&#39;s sounds fine. I&#39;ll give you a call sometime just to make sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  All right, great. See you then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  All right, thanks.
 </p>
