  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : So Sarah, you talked about competing in a rodeo. Have you done any other sports on horseback?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. Well, not a sport. I used to have a job, and my job was to take people on horseback into the mountains in Wyoming. And it was a really fun job.
  <br>
  Everyday, we would
  <span class="audionotes">
   saddle up
  </span>
  , maybe 15 or 20 horses. And then we would take beginners, people who had never ridden horses before, and we&#39;d show them how to lead the horses and get on the horses. And then, we&#39;d go up into the mountains for two hours or four hours or sometimes all day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Well, that sounds great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : That was your job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : That was my job, and it was really fun. We would walk along these cliffs, and people would get nervous and they&#39;d say, &#34;Oh no, isn&#39;t my horse going to fall down the
  <span class="audionotes">
   cliff
  </span>
  ?&#34; And I&#39;d say, &#34;No. Your horse doesn&#39;t want to fall down the cliff just like you.&#34;
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Yeah. Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : And the horses were really good. And to be honest, the horses mostly
  <span class="audionotes">
   ignored
  </span>
  the people on their backs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : The horses, they knew the path that we were taking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : And sometimes, people would want to do something that&#39;s dangerous like go too fast or go a different way. And the horses would ignore the people and go the way they&#39;re supposed to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : That&#39;s probably better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : What about wild animals? You&#39;re out going on horseback trail rides through the mountains, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. And the area we went through was famous for
  <span class="audionotes">
   elk
  </span>
  . We saw lots of elk. And, you know, where there&#39;s elk, there are also the animals that eat elk. So there were
  <span class="audionotes">
   mountain lions
  </span>
  and bears.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Bears?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : I never saw a bear. But I always told the people I was with, I said, &#34;Don&#39;t worry guys. If you see a bear, you don&#39;t have to be faster than the bear. You just have to be faster than the slowest horse.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Oh, that&#39;s a good one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Did the visitors like that joke?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : They did. They thought it was really funny until I pointed out which horse was the slowest, and then that person got really nervous.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Did you ever see a mountain lion?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : I never saw a mountain lion. But one time, the horses were all acting really nervous and they wouldn&#39;t go forward. And I didn&#39;t know why they were acting this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : They refused. And so, I ended up turning around and we went off the trail, and we had to make a big circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : And then, later, I found out that there had been a warning, that there were mountain lions in the area. And so, I think that&#39;s why the horses refused to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Wow. Those horses sound pretty smart.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. Sometimes in the morning, when we are the first people on the trail, I would see
  <span class="audionotes">
   tracks
  </span>
  , like wolf tracks or cougar tracks. But I never saw the real animal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : That&#39;s probably lucky.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   John
  </b>
  : Sounds like you had a really fun time at that job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Yeah. It was really fun and we were outdoors everyday. That was my favorite part. The air was so clean and I loved working with the animals and being in the sunshine. It was great.
