   Daniel
  </strong>
  : So we&#39;re talking about holidays. Is there any really, really good holidays that you remember?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Well, one of my favourite holidays was when I went to Greece a couple of years ago with my family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Wow, Greece, I&#39;ve never been there. How is it? Sounds
  <span class="audionotes">
   really, really
  </span>
  nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Greece is a very beautiful country. The houses are ... everything is so white and the beaches are
  <span class="audionotes">
   so
  </span>
  beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  :
  <span class="audionotes">
   So
  </span>
  what did you do in Greece?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Mainly I just relaxed at the swimming pool and at the beaches. And at night time I went shopping with my mum. And we had some really nice food too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Oh, that sounds really interesting, like the perfect holidays. So you said you went with your family, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yes, I went with my mum and dad and brother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : And for how long did you go there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : We went for four days. And when we went there was a big football tournament.
  <span class="audionotes">
   And so
  </span>
  everybody was so happy and excited. And at night times everybody will start dancing. And so me and my brother, we would join and dance with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Cool!
  <span class="audionotes">
   So
  </span>
  did you get to see any of those matches of the tournament?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Yes, I went to see one match with my dad and I had
  <span class="audionotes">
   so much
  </span>
  fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Oh, it sounds really cool, like really nice holidays.
