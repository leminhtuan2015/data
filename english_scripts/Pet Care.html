   So, wait, Lucinda, you said you lived in the country, and you said you could not have pets at your house?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   Yes, because we didn&#39;t own our house and we&#39;re on kind of a
   <span class="audionotes">
    nature reserve
   </span>
   so that any animal that could be dangerous to the wildlife like a cat or a dog or even a large rat would be a problem for the environment so we couldn&#39;t have any pets
   <span class="audionotes">
    apart from
   </span>
   chickens.
