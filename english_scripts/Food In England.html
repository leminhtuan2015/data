   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Phil, I thought we&#39;d talk about food.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  OK, yeah. Food is one of my favorite subjects.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so let&#39;s start out with fruit. OK, what&#39;s your favorite fruit?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  My favorite fruit is raspberry, which you
  <span class="audionotes">
   can&#39;t get
  </span>
  in Japan.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, raspberry.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Oh, well, you can get it in Japan but it&#39;s really expensive.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I love raspberries. Actually, where I&#39;m from in the states, we have
  <span class="audionotes">
   loads of
  </span>
  raspberries for free.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  My grand used to have them in her garden so when I was kid, it was always someone picking the raspberries and like vanilla ice cream and raspberries together.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, man, yeah. My grandmother, actually, she used to make raspberry cobbler.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Cobbler?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Oh, you don&#39;t have cobbler. You probably have a different name for it in England. It&#39;s like a pie, but it&#39;s really sweet. You take the blackberries or raspberries, and it&#39;s the
  <span class="audionotes">
   filling
  </span>
  and a pie crust over it. It&#39;s a pie. They call it cobbler, so..... Actually, speaking of British food, what&#39;s a scone?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  A scone is basically a really kind of dried cake, kind or really dried kind of cake material but it&#39;s got little bits of raisins in it.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so when you got to Starbuck&#39;s and they have the little triangle things, is that a scone?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know to be honest. I don&#39;t go to Starbuck&#39;s very often.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t recommend them, they&#39;re really, really, really dry. Generally you eat them with cream and tea, but I&#39;m not a fan.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No. Really.

  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Have you ever ate it?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Speaking of British food, what&#39;s your favorite British food?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Fish n&#39; Chips I suppose.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You got to be kidding. Fish n&#39; Chips?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Fish... British food basically is just a
  <span class="audionotes">
   cosmopolitan mix
  </span>
  of foreign stuff combined with together, like the most popular food now, the national dish, is curry.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. How come it&#39;s not fish n&#39; chips?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. Just because maybe people are going a bit more healthy or just because it&#39;s different, and curry&#39;s the most eaten food now.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Actually, I lived in England for about a year and I loved shepard pie.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Shepard&#39;s pie or cottage pie is very similar, yeah.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, right.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I do like it but, I don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t eat it that often.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, really. OK, actually now that we&#39;re both living in Japan, are there are British foods that you crave?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Um, kind of, something called Branston pickle, which is basically, it&#39;s kind of sandwich spread. You have it with cheese, or with like meat, and you put it on, it&#39;s like
  <span class="audionotes">
   diced vegetables
  </span>
  , but really thinly chopped and it&#39;s got a special sauce. It&#39;s just really nice. I really miss it.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. What&#39;s it called?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Branston pickle.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Branston pickle?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is it like veggiemite?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Not really, no, no. It&#39;s kind of actually lumps of vegetables within in. We have something similar to veggiemite called marmite.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, that&#39;s right.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  But the taste is actually stronger.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, cool.
