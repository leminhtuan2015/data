  Jeff:
 </strong>
 So were you always able to live with only
 <span class="audionotes">
  a few possessions
 </span>
 ?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Oh, certainly not. The first trip I ever did to South America I had the most massive backpack you could imagine. I mean I had to get it from a sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   military surplus store
  </span>
  because I needed to have the kind of volume that a World War Two soldier would have had to carry things, all of his
  <span class="audionotes">
   survival gear
  </span>
  . When I travelled to Africa in my early twenties, I brought along things like, for example, a jungle hammock, you know because I was convinced that I was going to be
  <span class="audionotes">
   stringing up
  </span>
  the ropes of this, and sleeping above the ground because I was worried about some sort of dangerous animals that might come after me. When, then later, you find out the reality is, that you&#39;re always able to find some sort of accommodation even if it&#39;s very budget type and wasn&#39;t a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Do you think... would you recommend this type of lifestyle to someone else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know if my lifestyles very suitable for other people because they have more
  <span class="audionotes">
   roots
  </span>
  than I do. They&#39;ve
  <span class="audionotes">
   <span class="audionotes">
    settled down
   </span>
   in some way. They have a regular job that they have to go to. Myself, usually only working perhaps four months a year, I don&#39;t have the same responsibilities that other people do and I&#39;m not married. I don&#39;t have kids. I have no need to decorate a room in any way.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Well, tomorrow, I&#39;m getting rid of my house, all my possessions and saying goodbye to my girlfriend and buying suitcase.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  OK. As long as you don&#39;t try to live out of mine. There isn&#39;t enough room for you as well.
