   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Phil, you&#39;ve been talking about your trip to Asia. I have a couple weeks,so I can go anywhere in Asia, what do you
  <span class="audiodef">
   recommend
  </span>
  that I do if i only have two
  <br>
  weeks?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  How much money do you have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Maybe $2,000, $3,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  If I were you I&#39;d probably go to Indonesia. -- Do you like surfing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know, I&#39;ve never surfed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  OK, well, Indonesia is not a bad place to learn either. I&#39;d recommend going, flying in to Denpassar, and getting down towards Dreamland beach. That&#39;s at the southern most tip of Bali. The waves there, I&#39;m a beginning surfer too, the waves there aren&#39;t very big, 5, 5, 4 - 5 feet, and just really nice people there. The locals are
  <span class="audiodef">
   willing
  </span>
  to help you. You meet a lot of Balinese young kids, 12, 13 years old. They&#39;re singing in the water as they surf. They&#39;re giving each wave names, so It&#39;s a lot of fun and there&#39;s
  <span class="audiodef">
   no attitude
  </span>
  , and people are there just to have fun. It&#39;s a good time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that sounds nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  That area of Indonesia is really nice. Lombok is nice too. If you are more wanting to relax, I would go to Lombok, and then go up to Gili Trawangan, which is a small island off the east coast of Lombok. There&#39;s no cars on the island. The electricity is a little
  <span class="audiodef">
   dodgy
  </span>
  . It might
  <span class="audiodef">
   flicker
  </span>
  on and off. Food is great. You get fresh fish all the time. Snorkeling&#39;s nice if you like scuba diving. You can arrange tours through several companies there. But, yeah, I really like Gili Trawangan and I would recommend that to anyone who wants to relax for a couple of weeks.
