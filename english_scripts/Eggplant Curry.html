   Ginger
  </strong>
  : So, Nabeel, I really liked that eggplant curry you made the other night. What&#39;s in that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Oh, you did. Okay. It&#39;s actually really easy. There&#39;s eggplant, and you need some potatoes, some tomatoes, and onions. And a few spices.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Okay, what spices?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Well, I use about half a teaspoon of tamery powder, and a teaspoon of coriander powder, red chili and cumin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Are those easy to find at any grocery store?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : You can find them at most grocery stores nowadays. If you can&#39;t find them at
  <span class="audionotes">
   the major ones
  </span>
  , you might want to look for an international food store and all of those carry the Indian spices.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : I have a really small kitchen. What kind of equipment do you need to make it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Oh, nothing at all. You just need a stove, and you need a sauce pan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Okay, I can
  <span class="audionotes">
   handle
  </span>
  that. So how do I make it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Well, first of all, you heat some oil in the sauce pan, and when the oil is hot enough, then you add the chopped onions, and a tablespoon of garlic paste, and a table spoon of ginger paste, and you let those cook for a few minutes, until the onions are turned brown, and then after that you, you add the tomatoes, and let those cook for a bit until the tomatoes have gone soft, and then you add all the spices: the tamery, the red chili, the coriander, the cumin and the salt of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  And just mix it up well at that point and add some water. The water prevents the spices from burning.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, add the potatoes and then add the eggplant, and then pour in about a glass of water and just make sure the tomatoes and the eggplant are covered, and then you turn it to low heat and put the lid on and let it cook for about fifteen minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Okay, I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   not much of
  </span>
  a cook but I think I can do that.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;ll give it a try
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Well, good luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ginger
  </strong>
  : Thanks. Maybe I&#39;ll
  <span class="audionotes">
   have you over
  </span>
  and let you try it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nabeel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;d love that.
