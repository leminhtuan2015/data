   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hello, Tini.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes, hello.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Tini, I know that you are a very good student and you enjoy being a student.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes, I enjoy being a student.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so as a teacher, I always want to know students are thinking, so I have some questions for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, the first question: Do you like homework?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   to some extent
  </span>
  , yes. That&#39;s a really difficult question. I used to hate it when I was small but as soon as... you know, like being a university student, you gotta be more initiative toward the work that you do and then so we don&#39;t have any more homework but we have to, like,  acknowldege our role and our responsibility, our duties as well, and then so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, how about in class, do you like to study alone or do you like to study in groups with other students?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, like different people, we have
  <span class="audionotes">
   different learning styles
  </span>
  . Like for me, I think I learn  best through listening and discussions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So that means you enjoy doing group work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes, I enjoy doing group work,  but of course, like, I would prefer, like, sometimes alone to have my own ideas first and then discuss it. You know, balancing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A balance. A fair balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes, a fair balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Next question is do you prefer a strict teacher who has many rules or do you prefer and easy going teacher who has no rules over the class?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Well, like for me, it actually really depends. I would like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a moderate teacher
  </span>
  actually. Well,...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Something in between?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Yes, something in between. A teacher who is very understanding and it&#39;s OK if there are many rules, however it doesn&#39;t really
  <span class="audionotes">
   cross over the line
  </span>
  , you know, students, they should have their own lives and then, like, the teacher should respect different ways of doing things for the students I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, that sounds good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  I like interesting teachers probably.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Last one, do you prefer studying with multi-media, like movies, audio clips, or do you prefer studying with printed material, like books and journals?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Like, for me I like hands on things, like I like to write on things that I read so I think I prefer, like, journals and books more where I can actually have like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a hands-on feeling
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That you are actually touching it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  Actually touching it, and actually you can write it, on it, like more flexible, I think, like for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, no, that is interesting. Well, thanks for you input.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tini:
  </strong>
  No, problem. Anytime.
