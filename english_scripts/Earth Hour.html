   Rachel:
  </strong>
  So Steven, we&#39;ve been talking about Costa Rica and how beautiful nature is there and how important it is to preserve it. What do you do in your life to save the environment or to protect the environment?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s almost daily that I think about this question that you just asked me. For example in my university I made this project for promoting Earth Hour which is just turning off the lights for one hour and enjoy a concert or some activity that
  <span class="audionotes">
   doesn&#39;t require
  </span>
  electricity. This Earth Hour is actually produced or created in Australia but we just trying to promote eco-systems, eco-friendly programs to the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  That sounds great, so how many people attended the event?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  More than two hundred people from the university came in and watch and enjoyed and actually all of them stayed and we also attracted faculty people which we never thought they would ever come and it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   impressive
  </span>
  that all these people actually wanted to make a change to the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  So that sounds like an amazing project Steven. If other students in universities around the world wanted to organize something like it, what were
  <span class="audionotes">
   the steps you went through
  </span>
  to organize that event?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Well, this even was mostly already planned by this organization called earth hour of course. However, in order to make the idea to actually work, we went through lots of
  <span class="audionotes">
   paperwork
  </span>
  . We tried to
  <span class="audionotes">
   recruit as many people
  </span>
  through advertisement and trying to be as eco-friendly as possible by reducing paper, and also we tried to recruit activities from the university in order to promote people to come in and enjoy this wonderful concert, and of course we had some marshmallow, chocolate, cracker which attracted most of the people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rachel:
  </strong>
  That sounds wonderful. So you had the barbeque as well as the concert and then candlelight as well. Is that right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steven:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I actually had candles which is lighting the concert and of course the barbeque. This was the main attraction for people but also because of this they learned that by turning off one hour of light they can actually survive. They can actually survive without the internet or turning on the lights and doing their homework
