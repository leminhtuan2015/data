   Todd:
  </strong>
  Keren, you have talked about places you have been. Now. why don&#39;t you talk about places you want to go. Where would you like to visit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Whoa! There are so many places. I&#39;d love to go to Cuba.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why Cuba?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I imagine it&#39;s such a
  <span class="audionotes">
   unique place
  </span>
  and it probably won&#39;t be so unique for much longer, and I&#39;d love to see what life is like there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. So about Cuba,
  <span class="audionotes">
   what is it that attracts you
  </span>
  about Cuba? I take it, it&#39;s not baseball.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  No! Well, part of the reason is that I can speak Spanish, so I love to practice speaking it, and it has beautiful beaches but it also has cultural history also. So there&#39;s lots to do there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now, I think you actually have travel plans
  <span class="audionotes">
   coming up
  </span>
  . Aren&#39;t you going somewhere soon?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I am. Yes. I&#39;m going to Cambodia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, Cambodia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What are you going to do in Cambodia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I am going to go to to Angor Wat to see the
  <span class="audionotes">
   old temple ruins
  </span>
  and then I&#39;m going to go to Phnom Pen and after that I&#39;m going to the beach.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nice. So, the beaches are popular now in Cambodia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I believe there are lot quieter than the beaches in Thailand but they are becoming more popular and they&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   supposed to be
  </span>
  beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now is this the first time you&#39;ve been to Cambodia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yes it is, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. So are you going straight to Cambodia or are you going through Thailand?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m gonna fly to Bangkok and go through Bangkok to the Cambodian border.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. How long do you plan to stay?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  About ten days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ten days. Well, I hope you have a nice trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Thank you very much.

  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, Rebecca, let&#39;s talk about things we wish could do that we can&#39;t do. What is something you wish you could do, that you can&#39;t do now?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I think it would be definitely playing music, like playing a guitar. Some of my friends can just
  <span class="audionotes">
   pull out
  </span>
  a guitar and start singing and then you have everybody around and it&#39;s such a great night. I just wish I could join them and actually, yeah, have fun with that as well, but no, I can&#39;t play guitar.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, if you could play any instrument, it would be the guitar?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I have played piano and saxophone before but not overly that well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really so you actually had musical training?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, when I was in high school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  In the piano and the saxophone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yep. Yeah. The saxophone was maybe for one or two years and I would love to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get back into
  </span>
  playing that as well, but they&#39;re quite expensive little
  <span class="audionotes">
   instruments
  </span>
  actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  And then the piano is very large so, you can&#39;t really transport that around with you wherever you go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So do you think that if had learned music at a younger age, you would still be with it? Was the problem just that you waited to late in life to start?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so. I think it&#39;s more the friends circle that I was with. We weren&#39;t really a musical group and the people that I&#39;ve met now are really musical so you sort of wish maybe if I had
  <span class="audionotes">
   kept going
  </span>
  I could have joined them now, but I do enjoy listening to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, what about singing? Are you a good singer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  No. Not at all. I don&#39;t think I want to be a good singer either cause then everybody would expect you to sing all the time so I just do
  <span class="audionotes">
   backup vocals
  </span>
  . Really badly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m the same way. I can&#39;t sing at all. OK, so basically you wish you could play the guitar, but you have played the piano and the saxophone before.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, is there anything else that you wish you could do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  To be able to speak maybe a couple languages would be nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s a good one. So if you could speak any two languages, what two would you want to speak?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I think Japanese and Spanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Japanese and Spanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah. They both sound really interesting and they&#39;re both the countries that I would like to go and visit and maybe attempt to work there but you need to be able to speak the language before you can work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. That&#39;s true. I think if I could choose any two languages I would choose Chinese and Arabic just because both those languages when I hear them they sound so completely impossible to speak, so if you could speak those, that would be pretty amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, definitely. Yeah, Chinese sounds like a hard language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   All those tones
  </span>
  .
