  Todd:
 </strong>
 So, hey, Rebecca, speaking of environmental stuff, I was reading about a drought in Australia. You guys have a serious drought problem with water?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we do. We&#39;ve had a drought for some time now and it seems to be getting worse and worse each year. At the moment, it depends on the area that you&#39;re in, but some areas are quite hard-hitted. We actually have restrictions on water now so you can&#39;t wash your car unless it&#39;s with a bucket of water. You can&#39;t water your garden at all, so my mom loves gardening, so to keep her garden, dad actually has fitted a special tube into the washing machine which filters the water out out into a bucket outside and she can use that grey water to water all her plants and that way she can keep her garden all nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s fantastic. You call it grey water?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Mm. We call it grey water.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is it only water from the washing machine?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is. We haven&#39;t done anything else with the shower water or anything, yet, and I think with the soaps that we use, they&#39;re more... not as hard on the plants, so they&#39;re actually growing really well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. Actually, the garden is doing better with the grey water than normal water?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Especially grass. Yeah, I don&#39;t know, maybe something in the water that they really love.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. All those dirt nutrients from the clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  From the clothes, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, has the government done anything like to raise water prices or limit how much water you can use per month or anything like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s a certain limit on water and then after that limit&#39;s reached, you actually pay quite a fair bit for water. Bottles of water have gone up to about three to four dollars for just a hundred-fifty
  <span class="audionotes">
   mil-bottles
  </span>
  , so it&#39;s quite expensive. Yeah, so water prices are quite high now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, basically, everybody in Australia just has to hope that in the future there&#39;ll be more rain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. I think the problem is that with the rains, it needs to rain into the basins where we catch the water so, if it doesn&#39;t rain into them, then the water&#39;s just useless to us when it rains. It just
  <span class="audionotes">
   runs off
  </span>
  because the ground&#39;s so dry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, you just have
  <span class="audionotes">
   the run-off
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, have you had other things like flooding or anything like that because of the drought?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  In certain areas when there&#39;s been big rainfalls, there has been a lot of flooding because the ground just doesn&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   soak it up
  </span>
  . It&#39;s that dry, but other areas have got water so because Australia is so
  <span class="audionotes">
   vast
  </span>
  , so wide as well, yeah, there&#39;s different areas that are hit differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, that&#39;s terrible. Well, I hope it gets better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so do I.
