   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Jeff, have you had all the different types of facial hair? We have beard, sideburns, goatee, mustache, soul patch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Handlebar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Handlebar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Nice big chops, sideburns. Oh, yeah, I&#39;ve had the Abe Lincoln style where you got the beard that just goes around from your ears around your chin, and back up to the other ear, Abe Lincoln, the soul patch, the mustache, the handlebar, the sideburns, the
  <span class="audionotes">
   full-on
  </span>
  lumberjack beard. Yeah, facial hair is really good. I like it, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well let&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   go through
  </span>
  these. When did you have the Abe Lincoln beard?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  I went through a real good Abe Lincoln beard phase when I was in India. I was in India for a coupled of years and I went with the Abe Lincoln style there, and I liked that. It was pretty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why did you choose the Abe Lincoln style?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a good style of beard and it was just I grew it and I liked it so I just kept it for awhile. It was a good style. And I like Abe Lincoln. He&#39;s great so it was nice to have a nice facial hair like him. It was good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what about the mutton chops? Have you ever had the mutton chops?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I have had mutton chops but my mutton chops don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   grow in
  </span>
  as thick and nice as some real nice â€¦ some people like old England, you know, like 200 years ago in the 17th Century, they had some really nice mutton chops.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Like how long have you had a beard? How low could you get it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  The sides of my beard don&#39;t grow in on my cheeks so they don&#39;t grow in too thick but I get a real long
  <span class="audionotes">
   wispy
  </span>
  beard, almost like an Asian style beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so one last thing about the facial hair. We got to talk about the handlebars? Have you ever had the handlebars?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;ve had a handlebar mustache a couple of times. Very
  <span class="audionotes">
   groovy
  </span>
  style, and again like my lamb chops, they don&#39;t grow in. The handlebar mustache for me doesn&#39;t grow in so well, but I&#39;ve attempted the handlebar and it&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s one that I don&#39;t do so well.
