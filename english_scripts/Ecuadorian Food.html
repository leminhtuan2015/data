   Todd:
  </b>
  So, Jose, can you talk about the food in Ecuador?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes, I was saying that the Andes is where potatoes and corn and many other kinds of food come, I mean, potatoes for example, that was so important for Europe, during the famine in Europe, so in that sense..
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Wait, potatoes come from Ecuador?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Of course!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  They do!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes, we have more than 300 different kinds of potatoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  No kidding! Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes, yes, yes! Potatoes and also corn from the Andes
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes. Didn&#39;t you know?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  No, no! That&#39;s embarrassing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  And do you know, of course for us, potatoes and corn and also rice. It&#39;s one of the main dishes, I think, or pork also, and we use lots of pecante sauce, chili sauce. Ah, corn is great. Corn with fresh cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Corn with cheese?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes, yes, yes, yes!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  How do you make it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Just you take the corn when it&#39;s fresh and boil it and you just put it with out anything, no salt, no butter, no anything, and fresh cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  No kidding, so you melt the cheese on the corn?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  No, no, no, no!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  So the cheese is hard?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  It is fresh cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Oh, I don&#39;t understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Fresh cheese! Do you, you have different kinds of cheese.
  <b>
   (Yeah)
  </b>
  You have this kind of fresh cheese. You have basically no salt, and it just made. Usually the cheese you have to mature the cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Oh, I got you! So it&#39;s more liquid?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  No, no, it&#39;s just called fresh cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  OK, well, I have to try it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yes, of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd:
  </b>
  Wow! That sounds good. And can you get Japanese food in Ecuador?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Jose:
  </b>
  Yeah, it&#39;s very expensive. You can do it because of course we have the Pacific coast, we have very good, what can I say, fish, and actually Japanese fisherman, they go to the Galapagos area and they pay certain fees. I don&#39;t know when, what they pay, and they catch all the tuna they want, so we have good, very good tuna, yeah, and many different kinds of fish so you can have sashimi and sushi and in Quito you have maybe two or three different Japanese restaurants. All of them very upscale at least.

  Hello Felipe, how are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Fine thank you and you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Good, good. Listen, I heard that you know a lot about Ecuadorean food. Can you tell me a little bit about it? What is your favorite or what is it that you don&#39;t like? Can you just
  <span class="audionotes">
   enlighten me
  </span>
  a little bit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well, in Ecuador, well pretty much all the food in Ecuador is delicious. For example, we have frita which is some fried meat, pork meat, and also potatoes and corn because I love corn and we have also many different kinds of fruits and we make juices and many different kind of desserts with these fruits. There&#39;s also some typical dish called ceviche. Ceviche is a coastal
  <span class="audionotes">
   traditional food
  </span>
  and it&#39;s made out of shrimps and lemon and tomato. I think it&#39;s quite unique and
  <span class="audionotes">
   nowhere else
  </span>
  in the world you can find something like that. It&#39;s quite delicious. And there&#39;s also a really spicy food so maybe that&#39;s the kind of food that I don&#39;t like too much because it&#39;s too spicy and it makes you sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  It sounds actually very exotic. What about
  <span class="audionotes">
   staple food
  </span>
  in Ecuador? What is it, the staple food? For example in Mexico we have tortilla. What about Ecuador, what is the most common food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well, yeah, in Ecuador we also have tortillas but they have different names. For example we have arepas which are made of corn also so the staple food in Ecuador is similar to Mexico and Colombia also because it&#39;s made, it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   composed of
  </span>
  corn and potatoes and mainly people in Ecuador they love potatoes and corn and especially corn because there are many different kinds of corn so they can make many different kinds of soups and also a kind of a bread made of corn and cookies and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Hmm, it really sounds delicious. Now I&#39;m very curious to try it but thank you for enlightening me about Ecuadorean food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Oh, you&#39;re welcome. Have a nice trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Thank you.
