   Ana
  </strong>
  : I heard that South Africa is famous for its wild animals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true. We have many different kinds of animals in South Africa. Have you heard of the big five?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : I think so but I don&#39;t remember what it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : So the big five are the animals that foreign tourists like to come and see in South Africa. And there are safaris and trips you can go on to
  <span class="audionotes">
   wildlife reserves
  </span>
  to see these animals.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : So what are they?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : So would you like to guess?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : I guess lions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Yes, that&#39;s one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : And elephants.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : And giraffes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : No. The giraffe is definitely a big animal but it&#39;s not one of the big five. The other three are rhinoceros, the – is it the water buffalo, I think. And the final one is – what is the final one?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Is it the cheetah?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Yes, the cheetah. Yes. The cheetah can run very, very fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Okay, and have you seen all of these animals?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Let me think. It&#39;s been a while since I visited a wildlife reserve but I&#39;ve seen elephants before. And let&#39;s see; I&#39;ve seen a lion. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a cheetah. I&#39;ve seen a rhinoceros from far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re quite dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t think that there are not many of them in the wild. I don&#39;t know if there are any in the wild. They&#39;re all in wildlife
  <span class="audionotes">
   enclosures
  </span>
  so that actually I don&#39;t think many people are injured or killed by rhinoceroses. But actually, do you know what the most dangerous animal is in Africa?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Is it the lion?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : No, it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s the hippopotamus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : I think they killed more people every year in the world than any other animal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Wow, that&#39;s very surprising.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Maybe mosquitoes kill more with malaria but in terms of big animals, it&#39;s definitely the hippopotamus.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : They have very long teeth as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s scary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It is pretty scary. You don&#39;t want to be – you know, they can swim as well. So they would – and if you go out on the river in a little bit on a dam and there&#39;s a hippopotamus, he can
  <span class="audionotes">
   tip your boat over
  </span>
  and bite you
  <span class="audionotes">
   in half
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : All right. So you should definitely look out for hippos when you go to South Africa.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike
  </strong>
  : Yeah. You should be careful. Crocodiles can also be
  <span class="audionotes">
   nasty
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ana
  </strong>
  : Okay.
