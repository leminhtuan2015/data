  Valeria
 </strong>
 : For example in Argentina if it is raining, it&#39;s like you change your schedule a little, right?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Because of the rain, because it&#39;s not like every day raining. But here you have to do everything under the rain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Yeah, but at the same time it, everything is made and it&#39;s built to kind of you know work with the rain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Yeah, for instance, the clothes, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Yeah, the clothes and all the facilities, you know everything is made for that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s preparing for having a lot of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Yeah, exactly. If you have, I don&#39;t know, two or three days in a row that it&#39;s raining in Chile, we will have serious problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : The same happens in Argentina.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Floods and that would be an issue so for me the weather thing is I like rain, just a little bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Yeah, from time to time it&#39;s really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Yeah, exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : And enjoyable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : But every day? Yes, it&#39;s true.
  <span class="audionotes">
   The thing is that
  </span>
  the weather is changing, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : And the
  <span class="audionotes">
   infrastructure
  </span>
  of my country wasn&#39;t prepared for this weather.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : So if it rains a couple of days in a row, sometimes the city
  <span class="audionotes">
   collapses
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true. A lot of cities in Latin America have the same problem. They&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   poorly constructed
  </span>
  and for that specific thing and we have a lot of problems especially with poor people. So when you talk about the weather I think it&#39;s not only your personal thing, sometimes you have to consider a couple of other factors as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : And the public transport?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I think that&#39;s another issue because for us public transportation is just
  <span class="audionotes">
   a complete mess
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : There are a lot of public transport in Argentina but the thing is that all the infrastructure is not prepared for a lot of rain so when it happens sometimes the subway should stop for a couple of hours and that is very annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego
  </strong>
  : Because it changes the whole schedule, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria
  </strong>
  : Yes, definitely.
