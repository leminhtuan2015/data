  It&#39;s just fun to go out with your friends, enjoy a day and have fun cause you can do so many things when you&#39;re out there on the
  <span class="audiodef">
   slopes
  </span>
  . You can go jumping and just
  <span class="audiodef">
   cruise down
  </span>
  and, there&#39;s just so many things you can do. Just the fact that you can hang out with your friends all day. It&#39;s just fun, it&#39;s just a relaxed atmosphere.

  I haven&#39;t yet but I want to go. I mean, Nagano prefecture has, as far as I know, a lot of good places because of the Olympics and everything so. I would like to go and check it out but so far, I haven&#39;t had the chance, no.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What do you need to know to be a good skier? See, actually I don&#39;t ski, so I went one time and it didn&#39;t work out to well, so.

  Well, you know,
  <span class="audiodef">
   practice makes perfect
  </span>
  , right! So it&#39;s all about practicing. You go out there, you go someone who knows the game and they&#39;ll teach you. Spend a couple of days and you&#39;ll be a
  <span class="audiodef">
   full-blown
  </span>
  skier.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Have you ever
  <span class="audiodef">
   trained
  </span>
  somebody how to ski?

  Actually, I went skiing once when I was in Australia, that was in 2002, and I had a friend with me from Singapore and he&#39;d never seen snow before, so we went out. I was snow boarding and he was actually downhill skiing, and it was a fun experience for him because he didn&#39;t know what was going on, so I taught him a bit but, yeah, he didn&#39;t really learn that much. Maybe I was, I don&#39;t know if I was a bad teacher or he was a bad skier, maybe a combination of both
