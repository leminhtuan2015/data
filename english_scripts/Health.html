  Todd:
 </strong>
 Jeff, I thought we would talk about healthy lifestyles. Now, you are one of the healthiest people I know. You are
 <span class="audionotes">
  very lean
 </span>
 . You are very fit, so what is it that keeps you healthy?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Many things, but I think discipline is one of the most important things. You need to be a
  <span class="audionotes">
   disciplined person
  </span>
  . A little-bit disciplined person, but saying that, it&#39;s not hard to be disciplined because you do things that you like to do, for example I do yoga, and I enjoy yoga so every day I get up in the morning and I do an hour of yoga and this is very good for your body. It&#39;s easy to do because I do it in my house, so I don&#39;t have to pay expensive gym fees and I don&#39;t have to get on a bus and travel thirty minutes to a gymnasium or a fitness center. I can do it right in my house, the front room of my house on a little mat, and I also get up with my girlfriend every morning a five a.m. and we go for a walk for an hour, a nice brisk walk and that&#39;s easy to do as well. Just a pair of sneakers and you can walk anywhere.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  And now you actually live in a city area, correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I live in the city. Yep, in Tokyo, a big, big city, so when I say you&#39;ve got to be disciplined, you can&#39;t use that an excuse. &#34;Oh, I live in the city so I can&#39;t walk.&#34; It&#39;s not true. We walk every day in the world&#39;s biggest city, Tokyo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, so basically, one of the
  <span class="audionotes">
   pillars
  </span>
  of your way of staying healthy is to have discipline to exercise regularly but it doesn&#39;t have to be
  <span class="audionotes">
   strenuous
  </span>
  , just little things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  A little bit of exercise every day. Something simple. Something easy. Something you like to do, whether it&#39;s walking or whether it&#39;s riding your bicycle to work
  <span class="audionotes">
   instead of
  </span>
  taking the subway, or yeah, doing some yoga. Just a little bit of exercise a few days a week and it will help you stay fit and healthy.
