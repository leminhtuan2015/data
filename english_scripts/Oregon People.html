   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from Oregon. It&#39;s right above California. It&#39;s on the West Coast of America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So the State of Oregon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s on the West Coast between California and Washington.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So you&#39;re neighbor states, say California in the south, do you guys
  <span class="audionotes">
   get along
  </span>
  ? Are you
  <span class="audionotes">
   good neighbors
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, we get along a little bit with Northern California. They have similar thinking. But Souther California, they kind of have
  <span class="audionotes">
   different thinking
  </span>
  . They think a bit more about money. And also, they are moving a lot up into Oregon, and they have different thinking and they are moving into Oregon and they are kind of changing things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So do you get a lot.... are you patriotic towards your own state of Oregon?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  A little bit. We just like to
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep things
  </span>
  the way they are just a little bit. Californians move up because they can sell their homes in California for a lot of money. They move up there and then they tend to be more conservative.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So, if I was to meet you and call you a Californian, would you get mad at me?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I wouldn&#39;t get mad at you, no. I would think that he must think I was from Northern California.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So do the Californians feel the same way about the people from Oregon? Is that a mutual emotion to dislike the Oregon people as well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so because there&#39;s been a lot of them moving up. You know they
  <span class="audionotes">
   move up there to retire
  </span>
  and they move their kids up there, so I think they life Oregon and Oregonians tend to be pretty friendly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  And how about the North, your northern neighbor? Washington?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Washington and Oregon are pretty similar as far a culturally.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So if I call you a Washington - if I say your are from Washington you don&#39;t mind as much as being called Californian?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Ah, that&#39;s true. Yeah, that&#39;s for sure.
