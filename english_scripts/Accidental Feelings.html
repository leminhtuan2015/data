  Fred:
 </strong>
 So, after this horrible accident, how did life your change? What are... What could you say are your after thoughts of after surviving such an experience?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Right. Like,
  <span class="audionotes">
   to be completely honest
  </span>
  , in the beginning I was really upset and I was like, you know, &#34;Why does this have to happen to me?&#34; you know. That is like immediately what you feel,
  <span class="audionotes">
   what anybody would feel
  </span>
  . But then when after, you know, recovering and after... while I was going through the whole thing, I basically realized that these things, they don&#39;t happen for a reason. My friend, he did not want to bang the car, you know, he didn&#39;t have anything against me. He really regretted it.

  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it wasn&#39;t his fault.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Exactly.
  <span class="audionotes">
   It&#39;s nobodies fault
  </span>
  , so it happens. It happens to teach you something, I guess, so basically I learned that such things happen. It made me a stronger person, you know, I was like, no more scared of car accidents or stuff like that because I&#39;m like, OK, they&#39;re a part of your life and they go on, so. Yeah, and then I was taken care of. I had all the time, these people, surrounded by people, yeah, who used to come: my relatives, my friends, they came to visit me. All of them got really worried so you feel kind of special. You feel that, OK, you know, like it really matters for other people when something happens to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s really nice to hear. So yeah, so when something like this happens, you always have people around you to help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  True, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fred:
  </strong>
  So that must be a really good feeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shibika:
  </strong>
  Exactly, and like, out of all the people, my mom had helped me the most, like because
  <span class="audionotes">
   I couldn&#39;t even move
  </span>
  because of the plaster. I couldn&#39;t move my hand. I couldn&#39;t do anything on my own. I couldn&#39;t eat by myself, so she had to feed me. She had to and
  <span class="audionotes">
   I felt like a kid again
  </span>
  , and she had to do everything. for me.
