    Todd:
   </strong>
   So, Steven, where did you go to college?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steve:
   </strong>
   I went to the University of Wales, um, the College of Cardiff there, so it the United Kingdom, obviously we have England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland and so I spent three years over in Wales.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Wow. Sounds fun. So what&#39;s university like in Wales? Is it different than University life in Britain?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steve:
   </strong>
   Yeah, it is. Um, for example Wales has it&#39;s own distinguished, distinctive language and culture as well, so if you go to Wales you&#39;ll see street signs written not only in English, but above that you&#39;ll have the Welsh language there and Welsh people are very, very proud of their language, and their heritage and there culture and it made it just a slightly different experience from studying over the border in England.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So they speak Welsh? Is that the language?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steve:
   </strong>
   That&#39;s correct. Yeah. Yeah, they do. It&#39;s not spoken by everybody in Wales. Since the middle ages, the usage of the language has declined somewhat but there has been a revival over the last 30 or 40 years, and now about, maybe about 40% of the Welsh population speak it as either as their first of second language.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Did you learn it while you there?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steve:
   </strong>
   No, no, I didn&#39;t, no. Everybody speaks English there. but there is a lot of good music coming out in Welsh now. There&#39;s lots of cultural festivals and when I was at Cardiff, there&#39;s lots of pubs where it&#39;s Welsh speaking only and it was quite good fun to go in there and try to order a beer and stuff in the Welch language, but that was about as far as I got.
  </font>

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Could you say that there&#39;s any, it&#39;s a stereo type, that&#39;s there&#39;s any difference between the Welsh people and the British people?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Steve:
   </strong>
   There is yeah, because they&#39;ve had a different history and obviously that affects how people have evolved over many centuries. They like different sports for example. They&#39;re more into rugby than they are into football. They tend to look slightly different than they do to English people. They tend to have sort of redder hair and darker eyes than English people, but also they&#39;re very, very loyal, they&#39;re very, very fierce, they&#39;re very passionate people. They&#39;re very nice people.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Well, it sounds like a nice place to go. I&#39;d love to go someday.
