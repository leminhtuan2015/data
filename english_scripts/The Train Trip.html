   Todd:
  </strong>
  Devon, I hear that you took the train across Russia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  Yes. I started in Moscow travelled through Russia, Mongolia and
  <span class="audionotes">
   ended up
  </span>
  in China.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s a long way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  Yes, it was. It took three weeks. I did it as part of a tour with 10 other people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man, that&#39;s a cool trip. That must of cost a lot of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  It did cost a lot of money but not a lot of people can say they have done that.  I
  <span class="audionotes">
   looked in
  </span>
  , I researched the trip several months before I actually took it. A friend and I did it together and there was one other American and the rest of the people were from Switzerland.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Cool! What was the landscape like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  A lot of it was flat and for miles around you could
  <span class="audionotes">
   see absolutely nothing
  </span>
  and as you got into Siberia there was scattered trees. When we got into Mongolia you could see some Camels every once in awhile but besides that there was a whole lot of nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! Just wild camels.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  Wild Camels around the
  <span class="audionotes">
   drinking hole
  </span>
  . Yes, saw that more than once.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how did you eat on this train?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  We stopped several times along the way and upon every platform you could buy food that local people were selling. A lot of it consisted of dried fish and other types of Russian delicacies and a lot of noodles that you heat it up with hot water. Every train had hot water on it on every carriage so you were always able to make noodles if you were desperate.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So was this a luxurious train or was it a pretty basic...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  It was pretty much the most basic you could get. There were no animals on board but sometimes they were
  <span class="audionotes">
   coal-heated
  </span>
  so it was very basic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! Would you do it agian?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  Great question. Would I do it again? Yes, I would do it again but I would wait several years to do it. One because it does cost a lot of money and two because there are many other things to do, to see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Thanks a lot Devon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Devon:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re very welcome.
