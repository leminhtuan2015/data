   Wow, Mary, that&#39;s a great dining room table. Where did you get it?
  </font>

   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Oh, thanks. That is something, a project that Dave and I worked on over a couple of weekends. We really enjoy doing
   <span class="audionotes">
    woodworking
   </span>
   and he actually has a very elaborate woodshop at his house and it&#39;s something I really enjoy working on too, so we thought of a project, which was the table and kind of designed what it would look like and bought some
   <span class="audionotes">
    lumber
   </span>
   and used his tools to figure out exactly how to put it all together and the process was a lot of fun, um, making the plan and actually using four or five different kinds of tools to
   <span class="audionotes">
    assemble
   </span>
   it and get it all put together. I have to say that I wasn&#39;t quite sure what it was going to end up looking like cause in the rough form it wasn&#39;t impressing me too much but once everything was sanded and
   <span class="audionotes">
    stained
   </span>
   and done it really impressed me so it&#39;s a lot of fun to do.

    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   So you made the table from scratch?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Yep, Yep we did. Just bought some lumber, certain sizes of lumber and ended up cutting it to the different kind of things we needed so it was like making a pattern and then using all these raw materials to put together to create the final product.

    Adrienne:

   Wow, that&#39;s really impressive cause it&#39;s a nice table.

   I really like it. It was a lot of fun to do.

    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   Um, any other projects you&#39;ve done that you have in the house?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Um, well, not quite like the table, but just some general finishing things, for instance if something is broken, like I&#39;m not sure if you noticed, but my front door has no
   <span class="audionotes">
    doorknob
   </span>
   at the moment so I do have a doorknob and I will be fixing that at some point, so

    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   That falls, I&#39;m sorry, does that fall into the category of woodworking?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   It can cause it&#39;s gonna involve some tools.

   I see. Very cool. Thanks.
