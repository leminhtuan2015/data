  I got a parcel in the post this morning. I was really excited because I love getting the parcels in the post. I love getting letters too but I don’t know, there’s something special about a parcel, especially when you don’t know what’s going to be inside it. So I opened the parcel this morning and there,
  <span class="audionotes">
   just in time
  </span>
  for Christmas, and everything is a big huge thing of Toblerone Chocolates, which I love and also, a
  <span class="audionotes">
   six-pack
  </span>
  of Tayto’s Cheese and Onion Crisps. Now, Tayto’s is an Irish company, and so it’s an Irish
  <span class="audionotes">
   brand name
  </span>
  and these crisps or potato chips, maybe as other countries call them, these crisps are absolutely the best crisps in the world. There is no competition. I think if you ask any Irish person, they’ll tell you the same thing, so there’re real, quite a strong flavor, I think but really cheesy, em, but it’s funny because I don’t, I don’t usually like crisps. I’m
  <span class="audionotes">
   not a big crisp fan
  </span>
  , but these cheese and onion Tayto’s, I’ve just finished the first packet and it really makes me feel, makes me feel closer to home, I …my friends, this is the
  <span class="audionotes">
   taste of home
  </span>
  . They’re so good. You should really try some.
