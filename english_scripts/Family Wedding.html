   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Travis, you said your brother is getting married.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Travis:
  </strong>
  Well, actually not my brother, my cousin is getting married. On my family&#39;s side of the family, on my father&#39;s side of the family, I have quite a few cousins and quite a few uncles and aunts. My dad is one of eight children, so we&#39;ve always been very close and basically we&#39;ve been a nuclear family around my grandparents of my dad&#39;s side, so my cousin, Brian, is going to be getting married in Puerto Viarta, Mexico, and I think that wedding is taking place about August 9th.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Travis:
  </strong>
  So we are all going to be going out there as a family. Hopefully we&#39;ll have as many as maybe forty of us, and whoever the bride invites , and we&#39;ll be on the beach for about 3 or 4 days, and have a wedding of Saturday, so it should be pretty exciting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mexico, that&#39;s an interesting choice. I mean, that&#39;s pretty far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Travis:
  </strong>
  It is pretty far away so it should be kind of expensive for all the guests to get there, which might be planned on my cousin&#39;s side because he might be trying to limit the amount of people who come to his wedding, so it won&#39;t get to overly large, and Mexico is actually cheaper to have a wedding than the United States because the power of the dollar versus the power of the peso, is you know, quite strong,
  <br>
  so you can go down to Mexico and for maybe a third the price have the same lavish wedding you might have in the United States, though Puerto Viarta might be a little more expensive than a normal Mexican wedding because Puerto Viarta is sort of a tourist and resort community.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Have you been to Puerto Viarta before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Travis:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve never been there before. In fact, even though I am from Southern California and from Los Angeles basically, which is only two hours from Mexico, I&#39;ve never been to Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from San Francisco and even I&#39;ve been to Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Travis:
  </strong>
  Well, Tijuana is a place everybody goes to, and it&#39;s never had any big appeal for me. Typically, southern Californians will go there, as soon they turn 18 , cause at 18 you can drink in Tijuana, and you can&#39;t drink in California when you&#39;re 18. You have to wait until you are 21, so that&#39;s a big reason to go I suppose, but I never made it down there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Travis:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sure I will.
