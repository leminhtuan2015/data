   Katie
  </b>
  : So what are three foods that you                absolutely have to have that you can&#39;t live without?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : I would say that I
  <span class="audionotes">
   could not live without
  </span>
  arepa. It&#39;s like my daily breakfast in Venezuela.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : What&#39;s that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Arepa is made of corn flour, and it looks
                                          like a hamburger. So you put anything you want inside
                                          and it&#39;s very tasty. And I would say like 95 percent of
                                          Venezuelans eat arepas every day. Well, it&#39;s kind of like a high-carb diet in my country.
                                          So I need rice also for lunch, and bread. Bread is
                                          another thing. In the afternoon, a piece of bread, sweet
                                          bread with coffee is kind of like
  <span class="audionotes">
   mandatory
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : So lots and lots of carbs in your diet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yes. What about you? What about in
                                          England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Well, English breakfast is not the
                                          healthiest of breakfast. It&#39;s like a big plate with
                                          fried eggs, fried sausages, hash browns, like hash
                                          potatoes, beans, just everything fried and everything
                                          delicious. And I would say that I can&#39;t live without that, but if I ate it every day, then I would probably
                                          not be able to leave my house because I would be so, so
                                          fat. But it&#39;s definitely a food that is in my top foods
  <span class="audionotes">
   of all time
  </span>
  . That&#39;s probably my favorite. But recently, I&#39;ve been eating lots of tofu. It&#39;s
                                          breakfast.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Oh, okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Yeah. So a little bit of tofu, a little
                                          bit of soy sauce just for breakfast, which is just –
                                          it&#39;s a bit of a boring breakfast. But it&#39;s really
                                          healthy, I guess. So I&#39;ve been eating that a lot every
                                          day. So I probably can&#39;t live without that recently. And also, pizza. Pizza.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Oh, pizza. Yes, very good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Pizza. I think everyone can&#39;t live
                                          without pizza.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Pizza is the best. Pizza is definitely a
                                          food that I can&#39;t live without.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yeah, I try to have pizza probably once a
                                          week, I would say. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : What&#39;s your favorite topping?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : That would be cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Cheese. Classic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Definitely. Bacon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Cheese and bacon. Oh it sounds good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yes. Very, very tasty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Just cheese and bacon or anything else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : No, no. I&#39;m going for anything actually
                                          but I will always need to have cheese and bacon on my
                                          pizza.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Pizza is not pizza without cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yes. Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : It has to have cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : So what else do you have? So you said
                                          tofu, pizza, what other food can you live without?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Well, my grandma is part Italian. So we
                                          have lots of like pasta and lasagna in our family.  So I try and eat – well, I try not to eat
                                          a lot of pasta because I&#39;ll get really fat. But pasta is
                                          definitely something that I can&#39;t live without. So good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yeah. Italian food is so good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Yeah. And again, lots of cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yeah. We also do a lot of lasagna but,
                                          well, we call it pasticho.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : Pasticho.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : It&#39;s a different name but it&#39;s the same
                                          lasagna. And it&#39;s also very
  <span class="audionotes">
   tasty
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : So good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yeah. But high fat food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : So like a real like
  <span class="audionotes">
   comfort food
  </span>
  , isn&#39;t
                                          it? Lasagna.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yeah. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : So good. So what would you say is your
                                          comfort food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : My comfort food – that would be arepa,
                                          again. Yeah, definitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : You said you&#39;re going to have lots of
                                          like fillings in that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Yes. So my favorite would be black beans
                                          with cheese inside. It sounds a little bit like a mix up
                                          of things but it&#39;s really, really tasty. We do eat a lot
                                          of black beans every day in Venezuela. It&#39;s very common.
                                          What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : My comfort food, I can&#39;t eat it
  <span class="audionotes">
   as much
                                          as I would like
  </span>
  to these days but it&#39;s probably my mom&#39;s
                                          spaghetti Bolognese. So good. It&#39;s so good, like lots of
                                          pasta, lots of tomato, lots of herbs, lots of cheese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Gilda
  </b>
  : Sounds good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Katie
  </b>
  : It&#39;s amazing. I would like live with my
                                          parents if it meant I could have spaghetti Bolognese
                                          every day. So good. So tasty. I think it&#39;s the best
