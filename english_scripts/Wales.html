   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Kevin, we&#39;re back. Could you talk a little bit about Wales.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Wales is
  <span class="audiodef">
   quite
  </span>
  a small country. It&#39;s west of England. There are about four million people who live in Wales. It&#39;s a bit like Japan. It&#39;s quite cold in the winter. Not much snow. But lots of sheep there.

   </a>
  </strong>
  And the people are quite friendly. I suppose it is quite a
  <span class="audiodef">
   poor area
  </span>
  . Not many rich people. A lot of people are
  <span class="audiodef">
   farmers
  </span>
  . And a lot of people are miners. They coal..they
  <span class="audiodef">
   mine
  </span>
  for coal.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it is a very beautiul land. Lots of mountains. So I like it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The weather is cold. Even in summer it is not too hot. So if you do surfing or windsurfing, which I do, you have to be very very
  <span class="audiodef">
   brave
  </span>
  . Yeah, but please come and visit Wales.
