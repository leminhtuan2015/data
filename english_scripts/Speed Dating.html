   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Have you ever heard about speed dating?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Speed dating? No. I have no idea. Fast....?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  This is a kind of thing that started up
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the last number of years
  </span>
  , and what happens is it there&#39;s an organizer and you go to some dates in a two hour period.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So this is an organized... it&#39;s organized and it&#39;s... what do you do? Like what do you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Well, you&#39;ll have a number and a little name tag and maybe you&#39;ll be Jeff number 7 and you&#39;ll meet and talk to these ladies. Those five minutes are yours to talk about whatever you like. Perhaps you&#39;re interested finding out what the girls enjoy doing in their free time, their hobbies, what their
  <span class="audionotes">
   background
  </span>
  is. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll have questions for you, as well, and if for example out of those twenty dates, there are four or five that you would be interested in seeing again, you put a little check next to their name on your check list. If any of those same ladies put a check next to your name, then you have a match, and you&#39;re able to contact those ladies. You are given their e-mail addresses and you can continue to be in contact with them and find out if someone might be right for you.

   Jeff:
  </strong>
  So that sounds great. Have you ever done it before?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  Yes, I have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  And any
  <span class="audionotes">
   luck
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jonathan:
  </strong>
  A little bit of luck. You know hard it is. People are looking for sorts of different things, so maybe my lifestyle isn&#39;t really suitable for a lot of people I meet and
  <span class="audionotes">
   vice-versa
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeff:
  </strong>
  Well, sounds good. I&#39;m in.
