   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Ruth, you&#39;re from Ireland.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And could you talk a little bit about the government in Ireland, like do you have a president or a prime minister?
 </p>

   Ruth:
  </strong>
  In fact, we have both. We have a president, Mary McAleese, and then there&#39;s another set, another
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/639-1-ruling-body.mp3">
   ruling body
  </a>
  , where the head is called the Taoiseach, which is Irish for Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister at the moment is a man called Bertie Ahern.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you have two Prime Ministers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  We have a president and then we have a Prime Minister.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and the woman is the
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  The woman is the President. Mary McAleese is the president.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, who actually has the power? Who makes the decisions?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Normally I think it&#39;s the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, that makes most of the decisions, and he&#39;s over the government. He decides the government.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and what&#39;s that title called, Taoiseach.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Taoiseach
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Taoiseach
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s Irish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so that&#39;s like
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/639-2-Gaelic.mp3">
   Gaelic
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah. There are still some parts of Ireland that&#39;s the Gaelic and, and also because it&#39;s one of the official languages. A lot of things will have an Irish name and an English name as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how do you choose the &#34;Taoiseach&#34;.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  The Taoiseach is chosen by the people. So we vote in the Prime Minister, but we also vote in the President as well. We get to choose both.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, that&#39;s quite interesting. Do the
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/639-3-elections.mp3">
   elections
  </a>
  happen at the same time?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No, usually they happen seperately.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so what&#39;s the point of having the President?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t really know. I&#39;m not big into politics, so I&#39;m not sure how the whole thing works.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  But I just know that we have a president as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, have you ever had a female &#34;Taoiseach&#34;, a female Prime Minister?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s never been a female &#34;Taoiseach&#34;, only female presidents. We&#39;ve had two female presidents. Mary McAleese and before her, Mary Robinson.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now is Ireland do most of the people vote? Do you have a
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/639-4-high-voter-turn-out.mp3">
   high voter turnout
  </a>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Quite a lot of people do vote. Mainly, older people, though. Younger people don&#39;t vote so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s not good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No, not very good at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think in the states it&#39;s like 50%, or going down.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s probably that, but maybe
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/639-5-on-the-lower-side.mp3">
   on the lower side
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, thanks Ruth.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No problem.
 </p>
