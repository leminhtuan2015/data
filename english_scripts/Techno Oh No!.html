   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Alright, so today we&#39;re going to talk about kids and technology. So Gareth, you&#39;re a father. Do you have any opinions on when children should be introduced to technology?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I have a lot of opinions. I&#39;m really interested in parenting, being a parent, and also technology, so it&#39;s interesting, and I often wonder whether or not I should let my kid play with computers and when I should start introducing these kinds of technologies like a cellphone and that kind of stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  So do you have any interesting stories about this and children?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  In the last two weeks, my sons -- we&#39;ve -- his grandfather actually, they are
  <span class="audionotes">
   in cahoots
  </span>
  about it. They destroyed, nearly destroyed, my computer. So I have a laptop computer, an apple laptop computer, and I left it at home, and I went to work, then I received an e-mail from my wife saying, call me as soon as you can, and I panicked and I called her as soon as I could, and she said that her father-in-law and my son were eating dinner and my father-in-law had glass of milk, and he
  <span class="audionotes">
   spilled it all over
  </span>
  the computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Oh, know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so when I heard this I thought, &#34;Oh, know, it&#39;s probably damaged, destroyed&#34; I probably need to send it to apple care and get them to
  <span class="audionotes">
   retrieve my data
  </span>
  , but luckily I got home and it works fine. I haven&#39;t noticed any damage, so far, but because it&#39;s water and it&#39;s coming into contact with metal, I&#39;m worried that it&#39;s gonna rust
  <span class="audionotes">
   over time
  </span>
  , and start to damage it. So that&#39;s the kind of first story that I have about that. The second story, it happened today.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Today?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so yeah, I love apple products and I often want to buy the latest product, so I bought an iPad, and last night it came, so I downloaded some apps and I put some music on there, some photos on there and I found this really, really good app for my son, and it&#39;s about toy story, and he loves toy story, and it&#39;s a great app. It&#39;s like a book, but you can color the pictures and it reads the book to you, and you can record your own voice
  <span class="audionotes">
   over the top of
  </span>
  it, so I can later on get him to record his voice and act out some of the parts, so I&#39;ve got this app loaded onto the iPad and I left it with him this morning when I came here, and my wife called me to say that he&#39;s already damaged to connector. Like he&#39;s bent the connector, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s damaged the iPad. Hopefully it hasn&#39;t but I&#39;ll find out soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Oh, my goodness. So maybe trying to keep kids away from technology when they&#39;re young is better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  At least cheaper.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Exactly. If you had asked me this question two weeks ago, I would have said yeah, give them technology. Let them play, but now no.
