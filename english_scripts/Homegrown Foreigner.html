  : So Jeremy, we both work in Japan, and I was just talking about how it feels like to go home. How does it feel like for you, Jeremy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeremy
  </strong>
  : Well, when I go back to Canada, really the first thing that I notice is the air. And it’s a funny thing to think but I know when I arrive in Vancouver and I walk out of the airport, I can smell West Coast Canada air. And it really gives a kind of positive feeling to me. You know, it’s a small thing but you notice how clean. I know it’s a stereotype with Canada but it really is such a clean place. And also, Vancouver, you have the smell of the ocean and you have the mountains right there. So that’s the first that I always notice.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when I go back and I visit my parents, it takes me about 10 minutes to get used to where I am being back home. You know, it doesn’t take long at all. And I think it’s because that’s the house that I grew up in and just the feeling that I grew up with, it returns immediately. You know, it goes away when I’m away, when I’m living in Japan but as soon as I get back home, that feeling of comfort comes back within minutes. And I look forward to the same thing that everybody looks forward to when they go back home, and food is right
  <span class="audionotes">
   at the top of that list
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  You know, I honestly look forward to turkey dinner, maybe more than anything in the world, or  prime rib or those types of things. But it’s just the small things; having mom make a snack or something like that. And just the feeling of being
  <span class="audionotes">
   completely at ease
  </span>
  and
  <span class="audionotes">
   without a worry in the world is kind
  </span>
  of what I most look forward to going back home.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s other things when you go out and you go to the stores and you circulate around town. It does feel a little bit like you’re an alien in your own town. And I mean—but that’s a feeling that I never mind. I have no problem being a foreigner in my own home now. I kind of enjoy the feeling. And sometimes, I even wish that I didn’t speak the language everybody else was speaking because I don’t want to hear everybody’s conversations to be honest.
 </p>
 <p>
  But you know the feeling of being in my house or my parent’s house is really a feeling that is just complete comfort.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : How often do you get to back home now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeremy
  </strong>
  : Well, just because of the cost, I can probably only go back once a year. And also, we have an infant boy and traveling with a one-year old on a 10-hour flight is—until you do it, you really never realize how terrible it is. But it is uncomfortable. It is really uncomfortable. So yeah, we’re only able to
  <span class="audionotes">
   make it back
  </span>
  to Canada probably once a year now but his grandparents love seeing him so much that we want to do it as much as we possibly can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I guess the fact that you can’t go as often as you would like makes it even much more
  <span class="audionotes">
   worthwhile
  </span>
  when you do get to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeremy
  </strong>
  : It’s true. It’s true, yeah. Just the expense and the time that we have to put in, while you’re there you basically
  <span class="audionotes">
   savor
  </span>
  every second. You don’t want to sleep. You just want to enjoy it. So yeah, it’s a pretty special experience going back home now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : That’s awesome.
