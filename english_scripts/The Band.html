 <strong>
  Todd:
 </strong>
 Marika, what is the best city in your country?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  I think Montreal is the best city in my country. I&#39;ve never been to Vancouver but I think Montreal is the best city in my country.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why is it so special?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  I think it is special because it has a lot of history, and a lot of old buildings and it feels like Europe but there is still a lot of modern things going on, and the French Canadian culture is there, very multi-cultural. It&#39;s got a lot of different things going on.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Well, how big is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  I think it is about 3 or 4 million people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jamon:
  </strong>
  OK. And what other cities are good in your country?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  I think Toronto is a good city just because it is my hometown. There&#39;s not many big cities in Canada, but I also like Halifax, which is on the east coast of Canada. There&#39;s really strong Celtic culture on the east coast. Lot of the descendants are from Ireland or Scotland, so it&#39;s interesting.
