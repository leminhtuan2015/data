   Simon:
  </strong>
  Hi, Lesie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  Hey, Simon. Have you heard that they&#39;re making the third episode of the new Star Wars series?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, I heard about that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  Do you like Star Wars?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Well, the old Star Wars that they made 20 years ago, I really like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  Me, too. Me, too.What&#39;s your favorite episode of the old series?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Of course, that would have to be number two, The Empire Strikes Back.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  Really, mine is the original Star Wars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Oh, really! Why do you like it so much? Why is it the best?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s the best because the characters are really, really different. In the second and third one they&#39;re kind of, they begin to mellow, but in the first one, they&#39;re really different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Oh, you mean that each character is distinct from the other characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  Right!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I like the second one better because it&#39;s a little bit darker and cooler and the bad guy, Darth Vader, of course one of the most famous bad guys in movie history, plays a bigger part and you know there&#39;s the drama and plus the, you know, the fighting, and the space scenes are all a little bit better and cooler.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  I see. Well, my favorite character is Princess Leia. Do you know why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll tell me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  Well, because she was the first positive strong female character I saw in the movies. She was take charge, told everybody what to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Well, she was popular with both girls and boys.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  Right! Hey, did you have any Star Wars toys when you were a kid?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, of course, I had the Luke Skywalker action figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  How about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  Ah, I can&#39;t remember. I don&#39;t remember if I have any, if I had any toys but I had the soundtrack to the movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  So can you sing, can you hymn it a little bit of the soundtrack right now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  No, but I can tell you most of the dialogue from the first movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  So that you can say that you are a diehard Star Wars fan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lesie:
  </strong>
  I am a diehard Star Wars fan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Simon:
  </strong>
  Yeah, when I was young, me too.
 </p>
