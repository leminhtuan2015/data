   Yuri:
  </strong>
  So Shirley, you were talking about
  <span class="audionotes">
   the shack
  </span>
  . Can you tell me some more about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  OK, well, the shack -
  <span class="audionotes">
   not as horrible as it might sound
  </span>
  . I was actually born in the city, and yeah, grew up on
  <span class="audionotes">
   the edge of the city
  </span>
  of Glasgow, and my parents ... maybe I was about seven or eight years old ... my parents decided they would buy this little wooden house in the country side, only about forty-five minutes drive from where we lived, but right in the countryside, and it was really basic. It was huge. It looked like a barn, and my parents wanted to try and
  <span class="audionotes">
   make it into something livable
  </span>
  like a holiday house that we could go to on the weekends and summer holidays and stuff, so anyway we went there ... for the first time we went, it still looked like a barn, and had some beds in it and stuff like that, but no running water, no electricity, no toilet, no bath, no shower. It was like a barn in the middle of nowhere, so as you know, me and my brothers, we are kind of raised in the city, and although, you know we were kids way before video games and iPods and things like that, there was no TV. That was the biggest tragedy. There was no TV, and we though
  <span class="audionotes">
   what on earth can we do
  </span>
  up here? It&#39;s like we&#39;re in the middle of nowhere, how boring this summer holiday&#39;s gonna be, so we just had to you know, try and figure out how we we&#39;re gonna enjoy this holiday and what could we do with no television.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Yuri:
  </strong>
  Yes, exactly, what did you do? How did you spend you days?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  We were out in the country side. I mean, you just need to go out and look, and there&#39;s so many possibilities to have fun: making tree houses, making dens out of the woodland ferns and things like that, going on searches for frogs. We seemed to do that a lot. Poor frogs. We made like a tennis court out in the front of the ... we called it the hut. Right, I keep calling it a barn or a shack, but actually what we called it was a hut, although it was a really huge kind of wooden house, and so yeah, we made up a kind of a tennis court and when it wasn&#39;t raining we could play tennis.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had to go collect water from a well near like, I don&#39;t know, maybe four hundred meters away, and we&#39;d always have to go in twos because of course there&#39;s always an argument with kids. I did it last time. He has to do it this time. So we always had to go in pairs to get the water. For lights we&#39;d just use a gas lamps. For cooking it was a kind of two stove ... two ring stove, connected to a gas bottle. We did have television, which was powered by a car battery, so we would save that until Saturday night, because always on a Saturday night there was a movie, so we would save the car battery power for the Saturday night movie, and it would usually last until the end of the movie.

  <strong>
   Yuri:
  </strong>
  So it was a bit like camping.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, I suppose but like camping, only thankfully we didn&#39;t get wet when it rained.
