   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Hey, Katie, did you hear that Australia are rejoining the Eurovision Song Contest?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : I did. It&#39;s a really big news. Really big news.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : So can you tell us a little bit about Eurovision? What is it exactly?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Eurovision is basically a music
  <span class="audionotes">
   competition
  </span>
  that happens every year in May. And countries from all over Europe have an entry in the competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : So big, big music singing competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : And it&#39;s Euro…
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Eurovision, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Eurovision, and yeah, every single country in Europe send somebody to sing in the competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : And all of Europe watches it, and all of Europe votes for a winner, and it&#39;s huge. It&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   huge
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : It does sound huge,
  <span class="audionotes">
   continental
  </span>
  competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Big battle with music.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : And where is it usually hosted?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s hosted in the country of the
  <span class="audionotes">
   previous
  </span>
  year&#39;s winner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Right. So this year then, do you know where it was?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t remember who won it last year, but the previous year, two years ago, it was won by someone from Austria.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : So last year, the competition was in Austria.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Right. That sounds like a wonderful event for the hosting country.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah. And I&#39;m from the UK, and the UK hasn&#39;t won it in such a long time. And I really, really want to win because I wanted to go and see a live Eurovision competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Right. So over the – you mentioned that you&#39;re such a big fan. Over the Eurovision history, do you have any personal highlights?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Probably my favorite entry was from ages and ages ago, before I was even born by an English entry called Bucks Fizz.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : They were really awesome. They were singing a great song, and then suddenly, halfway through the song, the boys ripped the girls&#39; skirt off.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Not that way. But they were wearing a long dress and then they were suddenly wearing a skirt. And it was amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : They kind of costume changed then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, costume change.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : And it happened in the &#39;70s, I think, &#39;70s or
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : &#39;80s, maybe?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Yeah. And at that time, it was probably the most exciting entry in Eurovision ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Oh really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s very exciting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : A
  <span class="audionotes">
   real shock
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Real shock. A big
  <span class="audionotes">
   costume
  </span>
  change, big drama.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : And how was the song?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Eh. The song was okay. No one remembers the song. Everyone remembers the skirts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Okay. So I take it, they didn&#39;t win then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Did they?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t remember. Also, I remember the costumes but not if they won or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Not the song.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katie
  </strong>
  : Isn&#39;t that funny?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aimee
  </strong>
  : Costumes, too are important.
