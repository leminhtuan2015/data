   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Keith, we&#39;re back here in the city. I&#39;m going to ask you some questions about where you live. First, is there a libray by your house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keith:
  </strong>
  No, no libraries near me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, that&#39;s too bad. Do you like to read?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keith:
  </strong>
  Sure, I love to read.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Where do you get you books?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keith:
  </strong>
  Well, I usually buy them at Tower Records or I order them through Amazon.com
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Note: this is not an advertisement. OK. Next one, is there a park by your house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keith:
  </strong>
  Park, yeah, there&#39;s actually two small ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you go there very often?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keith:
  </strong>
  No, not to often, because usually I don&#39;t get home from work until pretty late. Not a lot of part-time in my schedule.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So hang on. We&#39;ve got to let the car go by here. Actually, lots of cars here. Lots of traffic. Is there lot of traffic where you live?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keith:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, in the day time cause there&#39;s a lot of shops around my apartment, or near my apartment. But at night time it&#39;s pretty quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Great. Thanks Keith.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keith:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
 </p>
