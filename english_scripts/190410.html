Israel's parliamentary election is too close to call, exit polls say, as both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and challenger Benny Gantz claim wins.
<br><br>
Correspondent Linda Gradstein reports for VOA from Jerusalem.
<br><br>
Big drama, Blue and White is the largest party and it's impossible to tell who will be the next prime minister, said the anchor on Channel 13 news, giving challenger Benny Gantz's Blue and White party 37 seats to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 34 out of a total of 120 seats.
<br><br>
Other exit polls had Gantz ahead by one seat or tied with Netanyahu.
<br><br>
These are only exit polls and the results could change once all the votes, especially those of Israeli soldiers, are counted.
<br><br>
Pending an upcoming hearing, the Israeli attorney general says he plans to indict Netanyahu on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges.

Mayor Bill de Blasio says anyone who refuses to get a measles vaccine could be fined $1,000.

"It's crucial for people to understand the measles vaccine works, it is safe, it is effective, it is time-tested."
