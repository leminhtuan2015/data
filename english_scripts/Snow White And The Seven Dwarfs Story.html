    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Once upon a time, a princess named Snow White lived in a castle with her father, the King, and her stepmother, the Queen.  Her father had always said to his daughter that she must be fair to everyone at court.  Said he, “People come here to the castle when they have a problem.  They need the ruler to make a fair decision.  Nothing is more important than to be fair.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The Queen, Snow White’s stepmother, knew how much this meant to her husband. At the first chance, she went to her magic mirror.  “Mirror, mirror, on the wall,” said the Queen.  “Who is the fairest of them all?”

      “Mirror, mirror, on the wall,” said the Queen.  “Who is the fairest of them all?”

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “What?!” yelled the Queen.  “No one is more fair than I!  The Queen must have the best of everything - everyone knows that.  What could be more fair than that?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Snow White is the fairest of them all!” repeated the Magic Mirror.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “What do you know – you’re a mirror!” roared the Queen.  And she stormed off.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Still, the Queen was bothered.  So bothered was she that the Queen decided to be rid of the girl, once and for all.  “I cannot wait another day!” she declared.  The Queen called for her servant, a huntsman.  “Find a reason to take Snow White deep into the woods,” she said, pointing her long finger at the servant. “Then kill her.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-190" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad">

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The huntsman was shocked!  But she was the Queen, and what could he do?  The next day he took Snow White into the woods.  As he drew his knife to slay her, Snow White turned around.
    </span>
    <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-170" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad">
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Look,” she said, taking something out of her pocket.  “You have always been so good to me.”  She held in front of him six perfect arrowheads that she had carefully shaped.  “Do you like them?” she said.  “They are for you.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Snow White,” said the huntsman.  “I cannot do this!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Do what?” said Snow White.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 22px;">
     <strong>
      “Snow White,” said the huntsman.  “I cannot do this!”
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The servant dropped to his knees.  “The Queen, your step-mother, ordered me to kill you,” he said.  “But I cannot!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “She did what?” Snow White called out with alarm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “You must run away!” said the huntsman.  “Far into the woods, now!  And never come back to the castle!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Snow White turned and ran into the woods as fast as she could.  Deeper and deeper she ran.  It was getting dark, and the wolves were starting to howl.  She tripped and her skirt was torn.  Tall tree branches seemed to reach down to the very ground to grab her.  She was scratched, bleeding and scared.  Yet she ran on and on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 22px;">
     <strong>
      It was getting dark, and the wolves were starting to howl.

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Then all of a sudden in the distance there was a light.  Who was living so deep in the woods?  She stepped up closer and saw that it was a cottage.  Yet no sound came from the cottage, only light from the windows.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Hello?” she said, knocking softly on the door.  “Hello?” No answer.  The door was already a little bit open.  She opened it some more and stepped in.  “Hello, is anyone home?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     She looked around.  What a mess!  She had never seen a messier living room.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “This cottage may be the biggest mess I ever saw,” she thought.  “But it&#39;s a roof over my head for tonight. Maybe if I clean up around here, I can earn my sleep.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 22px;">
     <strong>
      She looked around.  What a mess!
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     As she cleaned, she thought of someone she already missed.  Before her father had re-married, she and a Prince who lived in the next kingdom were enjoying getting to know each other.  They would take long walks in the royal garden and tell each other stories, and laugh.
    </span>
    <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad">
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     After the Queen had moved into the castle, her stepmother had made a new rule – no more visitors.  Now the Prince had to slip over the palace gate in secret. He would call out to her from under her window and they could talk a bit that way. It wasn’t as good as the long walks but it was the best they could manage.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Now that she had to run away from home, would she ever see him again?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     After Snow White cleaned up the living room, she went upstairs.  On the second floor, there were seven little beds lined up in a row, as if for children.  Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned and lay across all seven of the beds.  Soon she fell fast asleep.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 22px;">
     <strong>

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     In the meantime, the Seven Dwarfs were heading home from a long day of working in the jewel mines.  When they opened the door, you can imagine their surprise when they saw their cottage all cleaned up!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “What kind of magic is this?” said one of the Dwarfs, whose name was Doc.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “I wouldn’t mind more magic like this!” said another of the Dwarfs with a smile.  His name was Dopey.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “We&#39;d better check upstairs,” said another Dwarf, whose name was Grumpy.  “Something is fishy around here, that’s for sure.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     There – lying across all their beds, was a young lady, fast asleep.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Who are you?” said all the Dwarfs at once.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 22px;">
     <strong>

   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Snow White bolted awake.  The Seven Dwarfs could tell she was as surprised as they were.  Soon they all relaxed and shared their stories.  Snow White learned their names – Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy. She told them all about her step-mother.  That her stepmother had tried to get the huntsman to kill her, that the huntsman had set her free in the woods, and that she could never go back home again.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Stay here, with us,” said Bashful.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “That’s sweet,” said Snow White.  “But if I were to stay here at your home, I would have to do something for all of you.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “You already cleaned up our place,” said Sneezy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Keeping the house clean will be easy,” said Snow White, “as long as we all pitch in.  I will let everyone know what part they can do, and I will do my share too, of course.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “That’s fair,” said Happy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “But there must be something else I can do for you,” said Snow White.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 22px;">
     <strong>
      “That’s fair,” said Happy.
     </strong>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The Seven Dwarfs shrugged.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Do you know how to read?” said Doc.  &#34;We have these books filled with wonderful tales and would love to be able to read them.&#34; And so it was agreed that Snow White would give them reading lessons.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     To celebrate their new friendship, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs sang and danced the night away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The next morning before they left for work, the Seven Dwarfs warned Snow White she must not open the door to anyone.  After all, who knows what evil her stepmother might do?  The princess nodded in agreement, and the Dwarfs left the house.
     <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      The princess prepared her first reading lesson.
     </span>
     She also prepared a good hot meal for the Seven Dwarfs when they returned home that night.  And so the days passed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 22px;">
     <strong>
      After all, who knows what evil the Queen might do?

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     Back at the castle, the Queen marched up to her mirror.  “Mirror, mirror on the wall,&#34; she demanded.  &#34;Who is the fairest of them all?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “That’s impossible!” screamed the Queen.  “The girl is no longer alive!”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Snow White lives!” said the Magic Mirror.  And an image was shown on the mirror of Snow White living in the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     The Queen turned red with rage.  She screamed, “She will not get away with this!”

    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     At the cottage of the Dwarfs the next afternoon, when the Seven Dwarfs were away at work, there was a knock on the door.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Who is it?” said Snow White.  She remembered the warning of the Seven Dwarfs not to open the door to anyone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “It’s only a poor old woman,” came a squeaky voice, “selling apples.” Yet it was the evil Queen, disguised as an old woman.  “It’s raining out here, my dear,” said her voice through the door.  “Please let me in.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Poor thing,&#34; thought Snow White, &#34;having to go door to door selling apples in the rain.&#34;  And so she opened the door.

   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Take a look at this big red apple,” said the old woman, who as you know by now was really the Queen in disguise. She held the red apple close to Snow White’s face.  “Lovely, my dear, isn’t it?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “I would like very much to buy your apple,” said Snow White. “But I have no money.”

   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “That fine comb in your hair will make a good trade,” said the old woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     “Well, all right then!” said Snow White.  She took the comb out of her hair and gave it to the old woman, who then gave her the apple.  Snow White took a big bite.  Alas, the fruit was poisoned!  At once, Snow White fell to the ground in a deep sleep.

     They chased that evil Queen out the door, and into the storm.  Up to the very top of a mountain they chased her.  All of a sudden, lightning hit the mountain!  The Queen fell, and she was never seen again.

     But there was nothing to help poor Snow White.  She stayed absolutely still in her deep sleep.  The Seven Dwarfs gently lifted her into a glass coffin.  Day and night they kept watch over her.
