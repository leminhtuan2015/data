  Daniel:
 </strong>
 Hey, Vella, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m good. How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m well thanks. Just wanted to ask you what&#39;s your favorite movie?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  OK, I have one
  <span class="audionotes">
   all-time Indonesian favorite
  </span>
  movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Uh, uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  And it&#39;s called Lima Juanita, Lima Kintai, Lima Macharita.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s, what&#39;s the name of it in English?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  In English the translation would be Five Women, Five Love and Five Stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Uh, uh. What is it about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  OK, it&#39;s basically about five women with different love stories and one of them, her parents died when she was really young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  She couldn&#39;t get a better job so she ended up being a
  <span class="audionotes">
   prostitute
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s really sad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is and the second one, she, her husband had an affair with her best friend and the third one, she couldn&#39;t get a boyfriend all her life. You know, she was really struggling to find the right guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Uh, uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  And I think she was really busy trying, you know, to find the guy that fulfills all her steroes, that she ends up, you know, not finding anyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Hm, hm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  And the fourth one, she got married only for eleven months and one day before the anniversary her husband died in a car accident.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was a really sad movie but, you know, you learned a lot from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it sounds really, really sad and really
  <span class="audionotes">
   depressing
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  It is. I cried actually watching it. You know, as a girl I learned a lot from it and, you know, it opened my eyes to, you know, society and how women are, you know, treated and how they experience, you know, love stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK. So how did the movie help Indonesian people to the movie? How is, did they like it, did they thought it was like only sad or did everyone thought like, I don&#39;t know, we can learn from this?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;ve read this website. They have, you know, many comments on the movie and I think most of the watchers were, you know, female audiences and a lot of them really related well to the movie and they really took it as, you know, a positive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK. And so it&#39;s, all the stories are quite
  <span class="audionotes">
   related to
  </span>
  Indonesian kind of reality?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Yeah, pretty much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  But, so how&#39;s the relation between like Indonesian movie industry and Hollywood movie industry? Which one is bigger?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Well, I think people in Indonesia are more attracted to Hollywood movie just because they have, you know, better story lines and I think a lot of us are
  <span class="audionotes">
   really into
  </span>
  , you know, Hollywood actresses and actors.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Hm, hm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  So, you know, they are more interested in watching Hollywood movies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Than Indonesian.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK. But the Indonesian industry is still...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Is still really big, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Really big, OK. OK, thanks.
