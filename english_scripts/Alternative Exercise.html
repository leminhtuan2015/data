   Todd
  </strong>
  : Hey Julia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Hey Todd, how are you doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Good, good. Now Julia, you are really fit and also you are a yoga instructor and a runner so you are the perfect person to talk about extreme exercise.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Extreme. I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m an extremist, but go on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK. So first of all I thought I would ask about this yoga that you do in like really hot rooms or something like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Yeah, the bikram yoga it&#39;s called.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Yeah, actually I&#39;ve never tried it myself. I know it&#39;s kind of a growing craze, maybe Madonna made it really popular. As far as I know you do it in a sauna but it can&#39;t possibly be a sauna.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Not a real sauna, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t know what the temperature is but I think the philosophy behind it is to try to recreate the same climate as you&#39;d find in India where yoga
  <span class="audionotes">
   originates
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right, so you want it to be really hot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : And humid, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : And also people who like to get the kind of the stretch value but also like to sweat at the same time. If you want a sweat yoga then it&#39;s a crank up the temperature is going to help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow, that&#39;s intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : It is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about, have you heard about cross fit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Cross fit? No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Cross fit&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   the big rage
  </span>
  in America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Cross fit, no I haven&#39;t heard of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Cross fit is like people do all of these really
  <span class="audionotes">
   old-school
  </span>
  exercises, like push ups or pull ups. They do like
  <span class="audionotes">
   jumping jacks
  </span>
  , they do really weird things like dead lifts, stuff like that but they do it one after the other in really short time intervals and like the work out only takes twelve minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : But if you do it right, I think some people actually get so fatigued they throw up so like you really push your body to the limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : That is extreme, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It is extreme, although I&#39;m probably saying it wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Good for weight loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, so it&#39;s actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   a big craze
  </span>
  where people do more natural body movements and you never do the same thing twice. You&#39;re not supposed to get into a routine. You always do things different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : You do it like spontaneously or you set yourself a program?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : There&#39;s a whole website, you go to the cross fit website and they explain it all but it looks pretty cool. It&#39;s like not your typical gym type workout.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia
  </strong>
  : Cross fit sounds like something you do on a BMX or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Right, right, exactly.
