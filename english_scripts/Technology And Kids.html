   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  So Gareth we&#39;ve been talking about kids and technology. So is there a time when you think maybe kids should have access to a cellphone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Well, there are many benefits to having a cellphone at an early age, like nowadays, you can get those cellphones that can call only a few people, like they can call your parents, and the police
  <span class="audionotes">
   and that&#39;s it
  </span>
  so they&#39;re really good and as a parent you feel more secure if you&#39;re child is going to school with their cellphone, that they can use it to call in case of an emergency, but then I often hear stories about kids ringing up,
  <span class="audionotes">
   racking up
  </span>
  a
  <span class="audionotes">
   massive, great, big telephone bill
  </span>
  , because they&#39;re texting their friends and e-mailing and they&#39;re calling and sometimes I see kids on the train.
 </p>
 <p>
  They&#39;re just glued to their cellphone, and they&#39;re sitting next to one another, like they&#39;re sitting next to their friends and they&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   glued to
  </span>
  their cellphone to someone on the other end of their cellphone, and it just seems so
  <span class="audionotes">
   anti-social
  </span>
  to me, like it seems that they don&#39;t have any time or they&#39;re not feeling -- they&#39;re not really considerate about the other person that they&#39;re sitting next to and they&#39;re more concerned and thinking about someone else.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, yeah, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m gonna ask him if he wants one and discuss with my wife and see how it goes, and see how it changes him. If it does change him, and if he does become anti-social then I&#39;ll take it away.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Take it away.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth:
  </strong>
  Take it away I was gonna say. That sounds easy now, but
