  Nick:
 </strong>
 So Cheryl, how do you make the first move?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Make the first move?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Yeah, when you&#39;re interested in somebody and you want to take it further: to become boyfriend and girlfriend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  I see. Make the first move! Well, first I think I would try to talk to the guy.Try to approach him and maybe ask him some questions about himself. Questions such as, &#34;Where are you from? What do you like to do? Why are you here? &#34; Questions like that. And then I would see how he would respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  So would you be physical? Would you maybe be
  <span class="audionotes">
   huggy
  </span>
  or ... I don&#39;t know ..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Flirtatious
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Flirtatious. Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Flirtatious. Well, I think that would depend on whether I have the courage to be flirtatious or actively flirtatious. Maybe, I would use my
  <span class="audionotes">
   body language
  </span>
  to show him that I&#39;m interested. Usually, when somebody likes a guy, they would probably lean in towards the guy, blink their eyes more than usual. Smile a lot. But I think if you have an interest in that person, your body should show it naturally and automatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Is place important?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Place? That is a very, very, very good question. If we are alone, then I think I would be more brave and courageous in making the first move. But if we&#39;re a room full of people, I might not be as forward as I would be alone with the person.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  So maybe would you make the first move and ask for a date or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Ask for a date? I don&#39;t think I
  <span class="audionotes">
   have the guts
  </span>
  . I don&#39;t have the courage to ask for a date the very first time I meet someone. I would probably have to meet them more than once, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   get to know them
  </span>
  and see if like that person more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  OK, I see.
