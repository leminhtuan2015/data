  Shirley:
 </strong>
 Hi Jake, how are you today?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Good. How are you Shirley?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Not too bad
  </span>
  thanks. I thought we might talk about
  <span class="audionotes">
   folk heroes
  </span>
  today. I don’t really know much about American folk heroes, are there any that you have a favorite or...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Actually my hometown in the United States happens to be known as one of the hometowns for Paul Bunyan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  I think I’ve heard of that name but I don’t know anything about him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Paul Bunyan was a lumberjack. Like, he would cut down trees and he was supposedly a very giant man. He was huge. And I don’t know if he ever actually lived sometime in the past, but maybe he was just a very large man but somehow the stories have been passed down to say that he was as large as a house or as large as a
  <span class="audionotes">
   skyscraper
  </span>
  . It completely depends on who you ask.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Wow, so not sure whether he’s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   mythical
  </span>
  character or a real character.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  No one really knows for sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  What did he do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, some people say that he took his ax and he dragged it behind his back across the United States and he made the Mississippi river.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  So it’s a kind of story to explain why something exists.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  That’s part of it. And also, he had a pet too. His pet is very famous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  And what kind of pet?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  His pet was an ox, but it wasn’t just an ordinary ox. It was a blue ox. And it was also oversized to fit with his size.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  What did his pet do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well his pet I think would just carry
  <span class="audionotes">
   lumber
  </span>
  for him or something...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  So about when did this story start? When did Paul Bunyan become famous? Or when did people know about that story?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, I’m not exactly sure, but like your country, the United States is a very young country and has a very young history since the European settlers came there so I think it’s maybe from a couple hundred years ago, maybe at the most.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley:
  </strong>
  Hmm. Ok.
 </p>
