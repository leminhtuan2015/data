  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  So Amir, tell me a bit about Iran people. How do they show affection to each other?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Oh, they do show affection. Yeah, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   it matters
  </span>
  , actually whether you are in the public sight or you&#39;re at your home, where you can just
  <span class="audionotes">
   freely show
  </span>
  your affections.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iran, as you know, is an Islamic Republic of Iran, so the rules of Islam is very much taken seriously in the public. In the public, men and women don&#39;t hug.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if it is a mother and a son, it&#39;s fine, but other than that where you don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   share blood
  </span>
  , you don&#39;t actually show that much affection or closeness or, you know, touching, in the sense of greeting even. You don&#39;t do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  But at home, we are very, very open with our emotions and we show our affections. So we kiss. We kiss each other for just greeting, like normally it&#39;s three kiss on the cheek, so first left, right, left.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Three kiss?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   At one time
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  In public, men and women don&#39;t of course kiss each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, what about Vietnam?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   pretty much the same
  </span>
  in our country. Like you know, in public, people don&#39;t do - show that much direct like affection like hugging or especially kissing. I think we missed kissing, you know. Usually, it&#39;s only lovers kiss, and even mother and child, they don&#39;t kiss.
