   Todd
  </strong>
  : Natalie, let&#39;s talk about our favorite things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : First, what is your favorite color?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : My favorite color is purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Really? My favorite color is purple too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, but I don&#39;t have purple clothing. I love the color purple, but I don&#39;t have purple clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Oh, well, everything I wear is purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No kidding?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s so cool. So what about food? What&#39;s your favorite food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Good question. My favorite food is pizza. I love pizza, but I don&#39;t like really big pizzas.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I love pizza too. What is your favorite topping on pizza?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I like really spicy toppings, so salami or pepperoni, chilies, and sometimes bell peppers too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you like thick pizza or thin pizza?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : No, I don&#39;t like thick pizza, because I can&#39;t eat too much. The thin pizzas, I get lots of toppings and I don&#39;t feel so full.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I agree. What about seasons? What is your favorite season?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : My favorite season is winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Winter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I love winter, don&#39;t you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No, I hate winter. Why do you like winter?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I love the snow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, I hate the snow. Well, I like the snow a little bit, but I hate cold weather.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I guess the cold is kind of annoying, but the snow is so much fun. I go skiing and I play snowball fights and I build snowmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, that sounds fun. What about sports? What&#39;s your favorite sport?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I&#39;d say my favorite sport is tennis.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s interesting. Do you play tennis?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, but I&#39;m not very good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you like singles or doubles?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : At the moment I&#39;m having singles lessons. They&#39;re really fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, now you are taking tennis lessons?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yes, about twice a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you watch tennis on TV?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : Yes, I watch it all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Who is your favorite tennis player?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I really like Roger Federer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. He&#39;s really good. Okay, last question. What is your favorite movie?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t have a favorite movie, but I really like comedies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So what is your favorite comedy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : My favorite comedy is Ace Ventura.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ace Ventura is very funny, but that movie is really old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : It is, but it&#39;s a classic, Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s like 20 years old, I think, maybe more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Natalie
  </strong>
  : I know. I&#39;ve seen it a hundred times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I like it a lot too.
