 Todd and Buddhi continue their conversation about household chores and responsibilities.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Looking back
  </span>
  I think other roles were kind of traditional like I have two sisters and they usually had the responsibility of doing the cleaning, and I had the responsibility of , you know, mowing the lawn, and taking out the trash and cleaning up the yard and stuff like that. Was it similar in your house?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  Well, dad used to do stuff like that and my brother and I didn&#39;t do much work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   You were spoiled
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  Very, very, very, very .... yeah. Did you ever decide to shift work with your sisters?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, of course,
  <span class="audionotes">
   it never even occured to me
  </span>
  . I mean, when you&#39;re young, you just do they tell you to do, and to be honest I was very happy. I think I loved doing yardwork. I loved mowing the grass and pruning the trees and, you know, taking about the trash - anything that was physical I enjoyed. I didnt enjoy cleaning. But you never had to do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  Well, I cleaned my own room and my brother cleaned his own, and I mean, it&#39;s obvious and it&#39;s ... I mean... it&#39;s something we really should do, like at home. When we eat, you clean your dish, and maybe we ... when I grew up, I&#39;d wash ... I&#39;ll do the dishes, and even if I didn&#39;t do
  <span class="audionotes">
   my mom wouldn&#39;t expect me to do it
  </span>
  , and make sure I do it somehow. If it&#39;s not done, she&#39;d do it. If I do it, well, she&#39;ll be thankful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, in your household, who mops the floor?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  My dad would.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Your dad would. Who washes the windows?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  My dad, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, your dad! He&#39;s hardworking. OK, who does the laundry?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  My mom or myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Or yourself? Really! OK. What does your brother do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  Most of the time, like, he&#39;s about eight years older than me, so as soon as he graduated from high school he went abroad for high studies, so when he was doing
  <span class="audionotes">
   the usual stuff
  </span>
  , I was a kid, so I was not doing anything, so soon after he went I took over or something like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well you did some stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi:
  </strong>
  I did. I&#39;m proud.
 </p>
