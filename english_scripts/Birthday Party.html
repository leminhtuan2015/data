  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  So, Kara, how did you like your birthday party last night?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  I had a great time. It was the first time probably I had a birthday party like that with all my family and friends in probably about ten years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, because since I met you, I&#39;ve never been to a birthday party. I mean, we&#39;ve gotten together, gone to restaurants, had a few drinks, but we&#39;ve never really had a party for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  I really enjoyed it. It was nice to have everybody out for it. Good food and good company.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, really good food. That guacamole was the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Who made that - your mom?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  No, actually it was me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  It was you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, my own recipe and I know that everybody really liked it, even if nobody believed that I made it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I don&#39;t think you look like the cooking type.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m not the cooking type
  </span>
  but I did make guacamole.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Well, Bravo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Did you like your presents?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  I loved my presents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  What was your favorite?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  My favorite? Well, the thing I needed the most was the screen I got to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  That was beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Make my
  <span class="audionotes">
   makeshift closet
  </span>
  <span class="audionotes">
   .
  </span>
  And my second favorite of course, because I&#39;m a shoe girl, would be the shoes you got me - the leopard high-heels.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I was really hoping you would like because I really wanted to get those for myself and for sure they didn&#39;t have them in my size so I just decided to get them for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  And the purse I got last night from you, I&#39;m wearing today.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Oh, I&#39;m so glad. I was hoping you would have enough stuff to match with it, cause you know, you don&#39;t have that much clothes or that many shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Very funny
  </span>
  , Lupe. Very funny.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Only half your room is filled with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Well, you know.
  <span class="audionotes">
   What can I say
  </span>
  . It&#39;s a habit.
  <span class="audionotes">
   You&#39;re one to talk
  </span>
  with your one hundred-fifty, two hundred pairs of shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  I think you do beat me with the count of shoes, Kara. I think you have a few more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Mm, I doubt it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  I think you are at the two hundred by now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Well, not there. I counted the other day. I only had about eighty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well you can always just use another pair, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Right, well now I can fit eighty-one.
 </p>
