U.S. Attorney General William Barr was again at the center of Capitol Hill drama Thursday without even being there.
<br><br>
AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports from the White House.
<br><br>
A day after a tense Senate hearing, Barr did not show up for an appearance with the House Judiciary Committee after taking issue with the Democratic-led panel's plan to have its lawyers question him.
<br><br>
"What we saw is fear."  Chairman Jerry Nadler called Barr afraid.
<br><br>
Another Democratic put a toy chicken at Barr's empty seat.  Republicans were not amused, with ranking member Doug Collins saying Barr would have testified if not for Democratic shenanigans.
<br><br>
"... the stunt and the circus continues over here."
<br><br>
Not long after, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ramped up the tensions, suggesting Barr had already lied to Congress last month, calling that a crime.

<br><br>
Maduro's televised address to the military came after two days of massive street demonstrations against his government.
<br><br>
Guaid&oacute; supported by a small contingent of defecting security forces called for a massive uprising against Maduro days earlier.
