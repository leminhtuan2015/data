 Hi, I&#39;m Ron from Hawaii. I&#39;m here with Mari from Japan. Today we&#39;re gonna be talking about food. So Mari, what&#39;s your favorite
 <span class="audionotes">
  cuisine
 </span>
 ?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I think I like American food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  What type of American food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I like hamburgers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Hamburgers. Is that your favorite dish as well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  That is my favorite dish. My favorite hamburger place is right near where I went to university and they have this hamburger called the Danish Burger, and the Danish Burger has blue cheese inside the hamburger, so I love ... my favorite dish has to be the Danish Burger.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Do you like any
  <span class="audionotes">
   side things
  </span>
  like french fries with your hamburger?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I love french fries but I know that eating hamburger and french fries is a little bit unhealthy so I always
  <span class="audionotes">
   replace
  </span>
  the french fries for a salad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  A salad. OK. What about dessert? What&#39;s your favorite dessert?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  My favorite dessert
  <span class="audionotes">
   has to be
  </span>
  chocolate cake.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Chocolate cake. Anything else? Do you like to eat it with anything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  No, I like chocolate cake by itself. Anything else? I like brownie sundaes, like brownies and choc ... brownies with vanilla ice-cream. I guess my favorite dessert is anything chocolaty.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Sounds good. So before you said you like to eat a salad. What type of salad, what type of vegetables do you like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I like all vegetables. I like them cooked or raw but I don&#39;t like raw onions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Not raw onions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I really can&#39;t eat onions
  <span class="audionotes">
   raw
  </span>
  . That&#39;s probably the only vegetable I can&#39;t eat raw.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s interesting. Thanks Mari.
 </p>
