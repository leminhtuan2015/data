   Warren
  </b>
  : Hey, Antoinette, why don’t you tell me about growing up in New York?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : New York. Warren, why do you want to know about that? Well, growing up in New York was lots of fun. I loved growing up in New York.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I couldn’t imagine
  </span>
  growing up anywhere else.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Yeah, really. The fun things I did – well, lots of movies to go see but I guess you can see movies anywhere in the US. Anywhere in the world for that matter. I enjoyed being able to go to Lincoln Center for concerts or Carnegie Hall and even play in Carnegie Hall. So I did play in Carnegie Hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Wow. Well, that’s exciting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Have you ever been to New York?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : I have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : You have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Yeah. I’ve been there twice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Okay. What did you do when you were there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : The first time, I was with my mother. I was 12 years old. And we went to Central Park and we saw some museums around Central Park.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : You didn’t go into the museums?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Yes, we did go into the museums.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Oh, okay. Yeah. That’s my park, Central Park. How did you find my park? Did you like my park?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : It was great. I was surprised how big it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : It is a big park. That’s what I like about it. You can
  <span class="audionotes">
   get lost
  </span>
  in the park and almost forget that you’re in a city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Yeah. That’s what I found really
  <span class="audionotes">
   neat
  </span>
  about it is sometimes I felt like I was in the countryside. But then I would see large buildings.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Yes. Yeah, I enjoy that, too. Did you know that you could ride horses in the park?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : No, I didn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Did you know about the skating rink in the park?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Yes. I’ve seen the skating rink on TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Okay. What time of year did you go? What season was it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : I’ve been there in the summer and in fall but not winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : It’s beautiful in any season, I think. I love Central Park.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Yeah, me too. It was very – it was a
  <span class="audionotes">
   memorable experience
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : I’m glad to hear that. What other places did you go to?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Well, when I was older, I went with my friend and we went on top of the Empire State Building.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Okay. I’m not sure if they allow you to go up there now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : That was around 2004 that we went.
 </p>
 <p>
  Antoinette: Okay. Were you able to
  <span class="audionotes">
   look over
  </span>
  the edge?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : I don’t know if I was looking over the edge. I think it’s inside but you’re at the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Okay. So yeah, things have changed a bit since I was a little girl.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Did it use to be outside that you could go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : You could go outside. There were these
  <span class="audionotes">
   binoculars
  </span>
  or I don’t know what they’re called but you put a little change in and you could see the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Yeah. They had those as well. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Yeah. We could see Central Park and you could even see the Statue of Liberty from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Oh well, I’ve been there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : Yeah. Actually, I never got to go. Both times I went to New York, we wanted to go to the Statue of Liberty but we didn’t have enough time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Antoinette
  </b>
  : Oh well, you should plan another trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warren
  </b>
  : I’d like to, yeah. Sounds great.
