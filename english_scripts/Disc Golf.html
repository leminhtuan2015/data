  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : So John, do you like to play golf?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, no. I don&#39;t play golf very much, but I play disc golf.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Disc golf? What&#39;s that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, some people call it Frisbee golf. Basically, there are
  <span class="audionotes">
   courses
  </span>
  at parks. It&#39;s similar to golf but the courses are much smaller. You use Frisbees or a flying disc and you have to throw it. So it&#39;s different from golf. You&#39;re not aiming for a small hole but actually, you need to throw the Frisbee into a basket.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Oh, that sounds fun. Is it very easy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, it can be easy or it can be very difficult. It depends on the course. Many different parks have different disc golf courses. And you can be an easy beginner or you can be an expert. It all depends on how much you want to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get involved
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : My friends are I, we are beginners, so we just like to have fun. So we just do the easy courses and have a good time. I think it&#39;s relaxing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : So you only need one Frisbee?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well actually, it&#39;s better to have two or three. You can play with one but in fact, when you learn more about disc golf, there are different sizes and weights of the discs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Why would you want a different size disc?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, it&#39;s similar to the clubs in golf. When you throw you first throw, you want it to go very far, so you should use a heavier disc. But when you&#39;re near the basket, you should make a short throw, so you want a lightweight disc.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I see. That&#39;s interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Yeah. So as I said, when you want to become an expert, you have to spend more money to get better equipment. It&#39;s like any sport, I guess. In fact, they have disc golf
  <span class="audionotes">
   competitions
  </span>
  now. So you can even participate in a tournament and win some prize money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Did you ever
  <span class="audionotes">
   compete
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Oh no. I&#39;m just a beginner. I don&#39;t think I want to be too serious about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : So golf has 18 holes. How about disc golf? Does it have 18 holes, too?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Well, not usually. Golf courses are very large, but disc golf courses are usually found in parks. So they usually have only six holes. But you can play 18 holes by doing all 6 three times each.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I see. How do you
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep score
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Score keeping is like real golf. So the winner should have the lowest score. Every time you throw a Frisbee or a flying disc, you have to mark one point. So if you can do a hole in one, that means you can hit the basket on your first try, then you&#39;ll only have one point. That&#39;s best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Uh-hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  John: But I&#39;m not that good at it. So usually, I have three or four points for each course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : I see. You said disc golf is at the park. Do you have little kids playing in the middle of the course?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Sometimes, the kids â€“ of course, they can play wherever they want. And the courses do go though the park where kids play. So we have to be very careful, and we have to use
  <span class="audionotes">
   good sportsmanship
  </span>
  to wait for the course to be clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : It sounds like a lot of fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : It is fun. Maybe you can join us next time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : That sounds great. Thank you.
