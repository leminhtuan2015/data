   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, guys we&#39;re going to talk about Halloween. So, what do you think about Halloween?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I actually like it. It&#39;s a fun holiday for kids especially because you get to dress up in costumes and you get lots of candy if you go trick-or-treating. I have a lot of good memories. of Halloween growing up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what is trick-or-treating? Why do you trick-or-treat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Trick-or-treat is when you go, you
  <span class="audionotes">
   dress up
  </span>
  in your costume on Halloween and you go door-to-door ringing doorbells, knocking on doors. One person comes to the door, you say, &#34;Trick-or-treat&#34; and usually these days they give you a treat which is candy or apples or something like that but in the older days, you could, if they didn&#39;t give you a treat, then you could play a trick on them or they could play a trick on you, instead of giving you a treat, something like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  I always thought that it was they performed, the person at the door performed some kind of trick for the kids because they didn&#39;t have candy to give, but I could be wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I don&#39;t know exactly. It&#39;s one of those three options.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think it&#39;s you play a trick on them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Oh, really
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You throw trash against their house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Toilet paper their.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Toilet paper, eggs,
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Egg their window.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Dog pooh in the paper bag on fire. On fire!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Yuck.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s gross. So, Mike, you&#39;re from Canada, so do you have Halloween
  <span class="audionotes">
   American-style
  </span>
  in Canada? Do you celebrate trick-or-treating? Do you do trick-or-treating?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, I think it is the same as in the U.S. I believe it is a little bit different in Europe, maybe. They don&#39;t have the same kind of traditions but, yeah, exactly the same as in the U.S. We watched all the Snoopy, Charlie Brown Halloween kind of things, just like everybody....
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. That&#39;s good. I&#39;m glad because now we can
  <span class="audionotes">
   diverge
  </span>
  . What was, what were your costumes when you were younger?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Ah, I had so many. My mom was a
  <span class="audionotes">
   seamstress
  </span>
  so she used to make a lot of my costumes. I designed them and she would make them for me and my sister so one year I was bat girl, another year I was Wonder Woman. Another year I was Princess Lea from Star Wars, I was a rainbow and a clown and a cat, and a witch and everything, basically that you&#39;re supposed to be for Halloween I was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  A lot of heroines in there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Of course. Strong women!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Mike, how about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  I was goat boy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Goat boy!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  I was always goat boy because there...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Every year?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we, I couldn&#39;t afford to get a decent costume every year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how were you goat boy? What did you look like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Where did you get goat boy from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  They just put some sort of, they put a lot of trash on me, and forced me to eat a can. It&#39;s OK. I got lots of candy but then the other kids would beat me up and steal it from me. That&#39;s OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s the saddest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well, you know. That&#39;s all right. It toughened me up when I got older.
