   Kara:
  </strong>
  So, Lupe, being bilingual you have a lot more choices than say I do with things like movies, music, books.  When you go to the store and buy a book, do you normally buy it in English or do you buy it in Spanish or does it just depend on  the book?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  I think it depends not only on the book: it depends on the mood. You know there are times when I really feel that I&#39;m forgetting certain things if I&#39;m not speaking enough Spanish or practicing it, so therefore I&#39;ll decide to go and buy a Spanish book so I can
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep up on that
  </span>
  , but you know, there&#39;s times when I just really want to read a really good book and sometimes the translations are not exact so if I know the book was originally written in English, I&#39;ll buy it in English just because I want the real thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kara:
  </strong>
  Now,
  <span class="audionotes">
   as far as music goes
  </span>
  do you listen to both English and Spanish? Do you have a preference, and what is your favorite type of music?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lupe:
  </strong>
  OK, so
  <span class="audionotes">
   when it comes to music
  </span>
  , my favorite singer in Spanish is Luis Miguel. I listen to him all the time. I love his music and in English my favorite singer in Mariah Carey so
  <span class="audionotes">
   I listen to her all the time
  </span>
  , and even though they&#39;re different types of genres they&#39;re still, you know, both my favorite types of music of the singer and he just happens to sing in Spanish. I love his voice. She happens to sing in English. I love her voice, but I can listen to all types of music in English and in Spanish. Sometimes, I&#39;m in the mood for Spanish music if  I&#39;m going out to maybe a Mexican dance where I&#39;ll be listening to more Spanish music and there&#39;s times when I go out with my other friends and I know we&#39;re going to be dancing to English music so get in the mood, I&#39;ll put on English CD&#39;s.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kara: And movies. There&#39;s not a lot of Spanish movies that play in the United States, but when one does come out every once in awhile, they&#39;ll have them at the theaters, do you like to go watch them, or do you just prefer the normal movies that come out here?
 </p>
 <p>
  Lupe: I really enjoy going to the movies, and you&#39;re right, Spanish movies don&#39;t come out very often, so when they do I get really, really excited that they&#39;re actually gonna have something in my primary language so I definitely go and watch the movies and you know, I&#39;m very happy and proud that there&#39;s finally a Spanish one coming out and that they&#39;re showing it in this country even though it&#39;s in Spanish and they normally just use
  <span class="audionotes">
   subtitles
  </span>
  , so yeah, when they do I&#39;m definitely one of the first people there to watch them.
