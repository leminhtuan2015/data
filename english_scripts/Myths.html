  OK. Growing up in America, in the United States, as a young child, we have three special people, mythical people, we believe in and we really like because they give us gifts or money. The first special person is the tooth fairy, and the tooth fairy gives you money for your teeth, so it works like this: when you&#39;re very young you lose all your teeth, usually one by one, so every time you lose a tooth you put your tooth under your pillow and when you wake up the next day, magically there is money under your pillow, usually it&#39;s a silver dollar, and so you&#39;re always very excited to get the money and it&#39;s kind of cool because, you know you&#39;re happy to lose teeth, maybe the only time you&#39;re happy to lose teeth you&#39;re entire life. The other special character we believe in is the Easter Bunny and the Easter Bunny hides Easter eggs on Easter Sunday. The Easter Bunny is a rabbit. Bunny means rabbit, and on Easter Sunday, a Christian holiday in March and April we go outside with a basket and we look for eggs the Easter bunny hid in the garden or backyard or something like that and there are two types of eggs: there are real eggs, hard-boiled eggs that are painted on the outside and often the children decorate those themselves and there are plastic eggs and plastic eggs are hallow on the inside and you can open them, and when you open them, there is candy or money, so those are the ones the kids really want to get. Actually, it&#39;s funny, sometimes kids won&#39;t even pick up the real eggs because they just want the eggs with money or candy in them.

  And then, actually, I&#39;m sorry we have one more person of course, and that is Santa, and everybody knows about Santa around the world, and Santa comes down your chimney on Christmas Eve Night, Dec 24th, and he puts gifts in your stocking. A stocking is a big sock, a big red sock for Christmas, and you hang it on your fireplace and then Santa puts toys and gifts inside for the good little children around the world, so the story goes, that Santa works all year to make toys and gifts for children but only for the good children, so you have to be good. If you&#39;re a bad child then you don&#39;t get any gifts but it usually doesn&#39;t work that way, so you come down the next day, and you go to your stocking and you&#39;re very happy because Santa had come. One other thing about Santa is usually as children we leave cookies and milk by the fireplace for Santa to eat as like a thank-you gift, and it&#39;s interesting because when you go down the next morning, of course the cookies and the milk is always gone and so I think you can guess who actually ate the cookie and drank the milk, but yeah, it&#39;s kind of nice, so those are our three special people that we believe in as children in the United States
