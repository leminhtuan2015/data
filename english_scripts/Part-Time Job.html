   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, so, Greg, growing up in the states, did you have any part-time jobs like in high school and stuff?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Oh, I&#39;ve had part-time jobs ever since I was a child.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  My first actually, I used to work for the American Seed Company. Do you know that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I can imagine. No. I mean it&#39;s just a seed company, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Yeah. Well, I actually wasn&#39;t paid in money. They would send me flower seeds, and vegetable seeds and then I would
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    go door-to-door
   </span>
  </span>
  , I would knock on people&#39;s doors, &#34;Excuse me, I&#39;m with the American Seed Company, would you like to buy some seeds?&#34;, and people would see this, I was probably ten or nine at the time, this young kid trying to sell seeds, and you know they would buy
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    a couple packs
   </span>
  </span>
  , and if I sold, say twenty packs of seeds, then I could choose from a list of toys or things (Whoa) soccer ball, or a dart board, and so I sold a lot of seeds. I liked it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How old were you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  I was maybe nine or ten then. (Really) and another thing I would do, around Christmas time, you know America is the tradition of putting
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    mistletoe
   </span>
  </span>
  up on the roof for Christmas, well I would climb trees, cut the mistletoe and then again I would walk door-to-door and say,&#34;Would you like to buy some mistletoe?&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You were quite the
  <span class="style4">
   <span class="audionotes">
    entrepreneur
   </span>
  </span>
  . The young businessman. (Yes) Did you make a lot of money with that job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  For me it felt like a lot of money at that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, well, I got to ask, did you ever work at a fast-food company, like McDonalds or Wendy&#39;s?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve never worked at a fast-food company.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I did. It&#39;s the worst job ever. It&#39;s terrible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Did you get to eat free food though?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, I did, actually, that was
  <span class="style4">
   the big
  </span>
  <span class="audionotes">
   allure
  </span>
  <span class="style4">
   of the job
  </span>
  , like I won&#39;t say the name of the company, but I worked for a major, major fast food chain around the world, and I thought, oh, I can eat all the hamburgers I want.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  You probably got sick of eating hamburgers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, are you kidding, I was 15, I didn&#39;t care like the more hamburgers the better, and uh, then actually I lost the job because I lied about my age and they fired me, but yeah, I wanted a job, I was like 13 or 14 or something like that. So how about, did you ever do the paperboy job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Yes. Yes. For a couple of years I delivered newspapers in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. How early did you have to get up to deliver the papers?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t remember, maybe around 6 o&#39;clock. (Right) It&#39;s amazing I did that cause I hate waking up early now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, yeah, yeah. That job&#39;s the worst just cause of the weather, like you have to do it in the rain. I was the paperboy too, and in the rain, it&#39;s just awful. You have the big plastic bags and, and you&#39;re out there throwing the papers, and yeah, it&#39;s not a fun job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and sometimes dogs chase you.
