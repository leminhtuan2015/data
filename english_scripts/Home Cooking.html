   Buddhi
  </strong>
  : So, Edwin, now that you&#39;re here, do you usually cook for yourself or you eat outside?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : I usually eat outside because I&#39;m a very terrible cook. I could
  <span class="audionotes">
   potentially
  </span>
  burn salads.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi
  </strong>
  : So, back at home, how was it done? You guys cook at home. I mean your mom.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : My mom usually cooked. Because of my Chinese ethnicity, she usually cooks Chinese food, cause Australian food is
  <span class="audionotes">
   pretty
  </span>
  boring, so she cooks ... usually cooks Chinese food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi
  </strong>
  : I remember back in my country, we also do a lot of Chinese food, and they did turn out to be quite spicy. Is it spicy as well? Or maybe, it&#39;s because in Sri Lanka, we use the spicy stuff. Or what would you say?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Well, some Chinese food is spicy. It just depends on which part of China it comes from. My parents are from Hong Kong, and Hong Kong food usually is not spicy, so yeah, I don&#39;t really like spicy food ... too spicy food, so yeah, my mom usually cooks really just bland food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi
  </strong>
  : So, you guys always just eat Chinese food, or do you eat Australian food as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : We rarely eat Australian food. My parents are pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   conservative
  </span>
  when it comes to food, so yeah, they pretty much
  <span class="audionotes">
   stick with
  </span>
  Chinese food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi
  </strong>
  : If you do eat any Australian food, what kind of foods do you eat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : I guess the most common one would be the meat pie. A lot of kids eat it in high school during lunch with tomato sauce, but something that&#39;s really interesting ... an interesting Australian dish would be the kangaroo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;ve had that a
  <span class="audionotes">
   couple times
  </span>
  . It tastes really good. You can call it a delicacy I guess, but we don&#39;t always eat it every day. Have you tried kangaroo?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi
  </strong>
  : Never. Never.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Edwin
  </strong>
  : Would you like to try?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Buddhi
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ll say yes, cause I like to try new foods, but I don&#39;t all kinds of meat. I just eat chicken only, so yeah, but I&#39;ll try cause you recommend it.
