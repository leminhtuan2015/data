  : So, Meg, are you busy? Do you have a busy week?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes. I usually have a busy week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, me too. So what day is your busiest day?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : My busiest day is Thursday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : On Thursday, I have to work from early in the morning until around 6:00 p.m. I have to teach classes. And then after that, I need to do my shopping at the supermarket.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Okay. I do my shopping on Saturday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, always on Saturday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : What else do you do on Saturday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : On Saturday, I do all my boring activities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Like what?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I do my shopping. I do my laundry. I run errands. I clean my apartment. I do boring stuff because on Sunday, I like to have fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : What do you like to do on Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : On Sunday, I often go hiking or I go to the park or I go to the beach. I go to the beach almost every Sunday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Wow, that sounds really fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, the beach is beautiful. Nobody is there. It&#39;s really nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it sounds great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : How about you? What do you do on Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : On Sunday, I always go to church in the morning, and sometimes I&#39;ll have lunch with friends after church.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : And then, I usually clean as well, Sunday evening before the new week starts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Now, do you work Monday through Friday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes, I work every weekday. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I work Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. I don&#39;t work Wednesday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, what&#39;s your schedule like on Wednesdays?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : On Wednesdays, I usually stay at home and I relax. Sometimes, I go shopping. Sometimes, I go to the park. Sometimes, I prepare lessons because I&#39;m a teacher.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So, sometimes you do a little work on Wednesdays?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yes, but I do work at my house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I never go to school on Wednesday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Because it&#39;s a day off. So, how about Monday? Are you busy on Monday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m usually busy on Monday because my schedule is similar to Thursday, so I have to teach class until around 6:00 p.m.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, Mondays are busy for me too. Mondays are busy. Thursdays also are busy. Tuesday and Friday are not so busy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Your schedule sounds a little similar to mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Well, we&#39;re both teachers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What about activities? Do you do any activities during the week?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : During the week, if I have free time, sometimes I will watch a TV show or a movie and I also go to Japanese language class.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, so sometimes I have homework so I have to do my Japanese language homeworks some nights. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I play futsal on Tuesday nights. Every Tuesday, I play futsal with my friends for two hours and that&#39;s fun. And then, sometimes on Friday, I meet my friends for dinner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : That sounds good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And I also like sports so I usually watch sports on TV on Monday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : What sports do you usually watch on Monday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I watch everything. I watch baseball. I watch basketball. I watch American football and I watch soccer. So I come home and I watch a video of a game from Saturday or Sunday. I don&#39;t watch sports on Saturday or Sunday. I watch the video later on Monday night.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Is it better that way?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Usually, I don&#39;t check the internet, so I don&#39;t know the score.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Well, it sounds like you have a busy schedule.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : You too.
