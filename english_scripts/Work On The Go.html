  Julia:
 </strong>
 So talking of working overseas, how does that work? How do set that kind of lifestyle up?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You mean like the nomadic lifestyle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, when you want to travel and just be free and how do you go about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s interesting. Like I think people get the wrong idea about working that type of life, being like a nomad. First of all you&#39;re actually not a tourist and in a lot of ways you&#39;re not a traveler. Like I actually worked and
  <span class="audionotes">
   oddly enough
  </span>
  , you know when I was just traveling and just living from city to city and working digitally from my computer, I
  <span class="audionotes">
   put in
  </span>
  more than forty hours a week. I actually probably put in maybe fifty or sixty because I had so much time. I had nothing to do usually so I would work usually five to six days a week and usually ten hours a day. So the first thing is that you work a lot and because you work a lot, you have to look for places that are conductive,
  <span class="audionotes">
   conducive
  </span>
  I&#39;m sorry, that are conducive for working. So the first thing you need is you need a hotel or like usually a short term apartment because it&#39;s usually best to stay in one place for about a month and you need a place that has a good desk and a good chair. I cannot
  <span class="audionotes">
   emphasize
  </span>
  the importance of a good chair. A good chair is actually so much more important than cable TV or a nice bed or a pool or whatever because you&#39;re going to sit in the chair all the time. So when I would travel, I would go to a hotel and the first thing I would ask is can I see...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  The chair?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Can I see the chairs in the room and if I didn&#39;t like the chair, I&#39;d say like look I&#39;m going to be here for two weeks I&#39;ll stay but you gotta get me like a nice chair. So that was one thing. So usually you want to get like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   short-term housing
  </span>
  . You look on the internet, you know, two weeks at a time and usually you can find something cheap. You usually want to be in a major city because you need to have internet and that is the most important thing. You&#39;d be surprised at what countries have fast internet. Like Vietnam really fast and you can work
  <span class="audionotes">
   wireless
  </span>
  from the beach. I used to sit on the beach with my laptop and have high speed wireless in some of the cities in Vietnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s amazing. You know, Thailand, Bangkok, it&#39;s surprisingly not that fast. So Bangkok wasn&#39;t that fast but if you went to a smaller city like Chiang Mai, the internet was really fast.
