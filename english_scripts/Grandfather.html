   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Conrad, you were saying that you have a grandfather and your grandfather is ninety-seven.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ninety-seven!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right Todd. I think he was born in 1910.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Yeah, ninety-seven years old and still driving.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! He&#39;s still in good health.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Yes, he&#39;s very healthy, and like I said he drives. He lives by himself. My grandmother passed away a couple years ago, and yeah, he basically can do anything he wants still.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Man!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  I mean, he still loves poker. He does that probably at least once a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  He plays poker. Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  So he&#39;s pretty sharp, still.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Does he just play for fun or does he play for money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Both. But usually money. I guess I should say always money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Always money? Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Yeah, he likes gambling.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, what else can you say about your grandfather?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Well, you know, he&#39;s been through some tough times. During World War II he was interned along with my parents when they were babies, so he lost his... he had a business going in Stockton, California. He lost his business, his house, interned, so he
  <span class="audionotes">
   made it through
  </span>
  that. He came back out of camp and started a new business, was successful again, so I&#39;d say he&#39;s been through a lot but he&#39;s made it through. He&#39;s made it. He&#39;s made a successful person out of himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So many people might not know what the internment is. Can you just explain briefly?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Sure that was during World War II. Some people felt that the Japanese Americans who were born and lived in Japan on the West Coast were a threat to the other people around them so they decided to
  <span class="audionotes">
   intern
  </span>
  them and put them into camps. Pretty much these camps were located in the most
  <span class="audionotes">
   desolate
  </span>
  place that could be found. Sometimes a place where they used to store horses or something, and I visited one just last winter, and yeah, in the the wintertime it&#39;s extremely cold and they had to endure some very hard conditions for I think it was for about four years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s terrible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was pretty tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Back to your grandfather, how would you describe his personality?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Well, he&#39;s still very
  <span class="audionotes">
   cheerful
  </span>
  . He&#39;s a pretty conservative person. I remember him once telling me - this is back I think the first time I voted for Reagan - and he was saying like, just talking about voting and he said, &#34;Always vote for the older person because experience is the most important thing you can have.&#34; Yeah, so his thinking is rather
  <span class="audionotes">
   on the conservative side
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, sounds like a great guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Yeah, he is Todd.
