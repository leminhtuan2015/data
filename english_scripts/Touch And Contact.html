  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Maybe it&#39;s something I
  <span class="audionotes">
   have to mention
  </span>
  about Iranians, we don&#39;t kiss,
  <span class="audionotes">
   of course
  </span>
  , on the lips. It&#39;s only on the cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Yes, even on the cheek?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Yes, on the cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Even on the cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Well, men in Iran kiss each other on the cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  What?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   just like
  </span>
  Italian people. We do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Really? For greeting?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  For greetings.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  In public?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  No, you go in the party, there are like fifty people sitting in the living room, then all of them stand up, and the new guest arrives, and then they shake hands and they have to kiss three times each person on the cheeks. It just takes so long. Sometimes when I&#39;m back from other countries I feel like well, just greet them by just waving my hand, things like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  What about holding hands?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Holding hands? We shake hands. Yeah, definitely, we shake hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  You don&#39;t like hold hands?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Ah, hold hands, like a boyfriend and girlfriends holding hands ... well, that really can be done only in the mountainside where it&#39;s not so much observed, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Oh, you know what? Actually, in Vietnam we hold hands pretty frequent. I don’t know why, but I got the
  <span class="audionotes">
   habit of
  </span>
  holding my mom’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  And, so when I first came here, I was so worried that they would say I’m a lesbian. or something. Yeah, but, we do hold hands a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amir:
  </strong>
  Uh, well, when you’re saying holding hands are you mean female or males you know or who you’re holding hands with?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, actually, you know of course lovers hold hands, but usually females. Females, Vietnamese females got the habit of holding hands
  <span class="audionotes">
   on the street
  </span>
  , you know, going shopping and hanging out, just friends, female friends. I don’t see many men holding hands, but usually females do it quite often.
