   Joel:
  </strong>
  Hey, Tom, I have a student that just got a
  <span class="audionotes">
   working holiday visa
  </span>
  for the U.K., and she asked me what she will be able to do whe she&#39;s out there, but I don&#39;t even know what a working holiday visa is, and I haven&#39;t been to the U.K., so I don&#39;t know what to tell her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the working holiday visa is a pretty new thing. I think it lasts six months, and you can work for three months. It&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   pretty popular
  </span>
  among students. Is her English OK?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, her English is pretty good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  Then she
  <span class="audionotes">
   shouldn&#39;t have a problem
  </span>
  getting work in, well, I used to work in a bar when I was at university and that&#39;s pretty good work. It&#39;s in the evening and the pay is usually pretty basic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  But you make tips, though, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  English people don&#39;t tip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  You just have to put the hours in. You might get bought a couple of drinks, but you&#39;ll drink them up after the shift.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  It&#39;d definitley make you English better too. You&#39;re talking to people all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  The best way to improve. You&#39;re expected to talk to the customers all night.  But if you didn&#39;t like the bar, it&#39;s a bit noisy and it can be quite smokey, she could work in a restaurant, out front, taking people&#39;s orders. That&#39;s another way to use her English and to get to meet some different people and that will tip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  OK, you tip at restaurants, but not at bars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  I see.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  And if she was struggling a bit she could work in the back of a restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Washing dishes or something like that. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s not much fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I used to wash dishes, that was my first job ever and I remember my legs being so
  <span class="audionotes">
   sore
  </span>
  from standing up all day. It was a terrible job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  I wouldn&#39;t recommend that one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  So the working holiday though, you said it&#39;s three months but the visa is for 6 months, so you work for the second 3 months and then maybe you&#39;d study for the first 3 months?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  No, it&#39;s not for studying. It&#39;s a holiday. You travel. You go from place to place and you
  <span class="audionotes">
   pick up
  </span>
  jobs on the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  OK, so, but still you, the second half is when you would work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tom:
  </strong>
  You can mix it up. You can work for a maximum of three months, but no more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s interesting.
 </p>
