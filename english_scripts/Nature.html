   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Hello, Kevin?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Hi, Todd. How are you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Doing pretty good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Kevin we&#39;re gonna talk about nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  First of all could you tell the listener where we are?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Well, let&#39;s see. We are on, kind of on the side of a hill in the forest but we have a spectacular view of Mount Fuji on the other side of the valley.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. It&#39;s really nice here. Why are you in this forest right now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m currently working and I&#39;m teaching an
  <span class="audionotes">
   intensive English course
  </span>
  up here at the campus.. up here in the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice. Do you take any walks
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the woods
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Yes, I enjoy
  <span class="audionotes">
   taking walks
  </span>
  <span class="audiodef">
   in the woods.
  </span>
  And sometimes I even go for a jog in the woods, there&#39;s a few trails around here and there&#39;s a nice golf course as well that you can run around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, great! What&#39;s the best thing about being in nature? In the forest?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  Well, for me it&#39;s the
  <span class="audionotes">
   stress relief
  </span>
  that it provides especially living in Tokyo which is of course one of the world&#39;s largest and most chaotic cities. It&#39;s also nice to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get back out
  </span>
  into nature sometimes and just hear the insects which obviously we can hear very clearly right now, as well as some birds and you know it&#39;s just nice to get back out into nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I agree. OK. Thanks a lot Kevin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kevin:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
