   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Aaron, how does the government work in Australia?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Aaron:
  </strong>
  The government in Australia is very simple. We have two major parties. The Liberal Party and the Labor Party, and the people decide who the Prime Minister is. You chose a politician to be in your area, and the party with the most areas won get the Prime Minister, and we know who the Prime Minister will be before we vote, so we&#39;re voting for the Prime Minister. It&#39;s very simple.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And who is the Prime Minister right now?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Aaron:
  </strong>
  The Prime Minister right now is John Howard, but in November this year there&#39;s an election and he might lose his place.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Is he more conservative or liberal?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Aaron:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s, liberal is conservative in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, it&#39;s back, it&#39;s the other way around.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Aaron:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Liberal is the conservative party and he&#39;s very liberal.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:OK.
  </strong>
  Interesting. How long has he been in office?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Aaron:
  </strong>
  He&#39;s been in office now for about 10 years. He&#39;s won three elections and this will be his fourth election. In Australia there&#39;s now limit to how long you can stay. I know in the states it&#39;s two terms for the president. In Australia you can take as many years as you want. The longest serving Prime Minister went for 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You think Howard will break the record?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Aaron:
  </strong>
  I think he&#39;s going to retire. He&#39;s sixty seven now. So he&#39;s talking about retiring. So I think he&#39;s going to retire after he wins the next election.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, you&#39;re in Japan. Will you be able to vote for your election in Australia?
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Aaron:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;ll be able to vote. I can vote in an absentee vote we call it, where as I can post a vote home, so that&#39;s no problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, same for us.
  <br>
