  George:
 </strong>
 Hey, hey, hey!
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Hey, hey, hey! How&#39;s it going?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Bad!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Why? What&#39;s up?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m
  <span class="audionotes">
   a little low on cash
  </span>
  these days?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Really? What about getting a new job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Well, Where? What&#39;s open?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t know. You&#39;re graduating soon, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Well, there&#39;s still a good half-year before that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, yeah, those half-years, you should
  <span class="audionotes">
   spend it wisely
  </span>
  . This is the best chance to get a job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  What do you mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Well, I don&#39;t know, like, I think this is your last chance to get a job before you graduate. Or what do you plan on after graduating?
  <span class="audionotes">
   Just hanging around
  </span>
  ? Playing games?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. I have no idea what to do after graduation. Do you have any plans?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Well, for me ... well, since the economy is going bad, like there is no opening at the moment, but I was thinking if I could be able to like find an internship in a different country or maybe I could keep doing my part-time job at the moment just until things start getting better. Well, I guess you still have nine months left.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Yeah. It&#39;s a little depressing though thinking about graduation. Being
  <span class="audionotes">
   thrown out into the real world
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  All my friends who graduated, they&#39;re already regretting. They want to go back to school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Oh, boy!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Speaking of which
  </span>
  , how about we go to grad school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  No!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Grad School!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know if I could deal with another four years of school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not four years. It&#39;s only two years, and plus, like, I mean, if you&#39;re gonna regret so much like getting a job, like, and plus the economy is really bad for a job right now, I think it&#39;s best to
  <span class="audionotes">
   lay low
  </span>
  and just, you know maybe study a little bit more till the economy gets better and then get a job then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Well, if I could get some sort of full scholarship, perhaps I would be more inclined to do it, but ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah. It&#39;s not bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think I could get a scholarship with my horrible G.P.A.?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Crystal:
  </strong>
  Same here!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   George:
  </strong>
  Hmm! Grad school!
 </p>
