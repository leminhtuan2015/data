U.S. President Donald Trump visited the U.S. Border Patrol station in Calexico on California, a crossing point between the United States and Mexico Friday, saying the country cannot take any more migrants..
<br><br>
AP's Sagar Meghani has details.
<br><br>
The president's arguing he has made progress and convincing the country there is a national emergency at the border and he is claiming a new phrase and saying there is a "colossal surge" in the legal border crossings.
<br><br>
"Our country is full, our area's full, the sector is full.  We can't take you anymore, I'm sorry."
<br><br>
In Calexico not far from the Mexico border, the president talked with immigration agents hours after ???rapping his threat to close the border altogether while saying he prefers to, instead, slap tariffs on cars made in Mexico and brought to the U.S.
<br><br>
He says he is holding off because Mexico's making strides in stopping migrants.

<br><br>
Meanwhile, California and 19 other states that are suing President Trump over his emergency declaration want a court order to stop money from being diverted to fund the border wall project.
<br><br>
AP's Ed Donahue has details.
<br><br>
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra says what the president wants to do is unconstitutional.
<br><br>
"... if you want to build something using taxpayer money, you gotta get permission.  The way previous presidents have always done."
<br><br>
He wants Congress to authorize funding.  Becerra says money will be siphoned away from fighting drug trafficking and military construction projects.
<br><br>
"There are 6.7 billion reasons whey California is in the ??? not only in it leading the lawsuit.  We are the biggest state.  We stand to lose perhaps the most money."
<br><br>
President Trump says people in California want the wall.

The U.N. Security Council and foreign ministers of the Group of 7 nations said on Friday that they were strongly opposed to military action in Libya.
<br><br>
Germany's U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said the Security Council called on Libyan National Army troops commanded by Khalifa Haftar to stop all military movements.
<br><br>
"They called on LNA forces to halt all military movements.  They also called on all forces to de-escalate and halt military activity.  There can be no military solution to the conflict."
<br><br>
Earlier Friday, foreign ministers from France, Britain, Germany, the United States, Italy and Japan and Canada meeting in France said in a statement that they firmly believe there was no military solution to the Libyan conflict.
<br><br>
The advance that began Thursday by Haftar's Libyan National Army force which is allied to a parallel administration based in the east, escalates a power struggle that has splintered the nation since the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi eight years ago.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Saudi Arabia has arrested at least eight writers and activists, including two who hold dual U.S.-Saudi citizenship, in the latest crackdown on supporters of women activists.
<br><br>
Rights workers say the detained have all expressed support for a group of Saudi women activists now on trial for allegedly defaming the kingdom over its treatment of women.
<br><br>
Most of the arrests occurred Thursday and coincide with a vote by the U.S. House of Representatives to cut American support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.  U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to indicate if he will veto that bill.  Several analysts in the Arab media tied the arrests of the Saudi activists to the vote by the U.S. House.
<br><br>
The arrests represent the first crackdown on the kingdom's critics since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Hiring rebounded in March, with 196,000 jobs added to the U.S. economy.
<br><br>
AP's Shelley Adler reports.
<br><br>
Hiring was way up in March.
<br><br>
"This is a good sort of report.  I think the February report we had only 33,000 jobs added.  It was ???.  And I would expect that we see, you know, 150,000 to 175,000 jobs for a month added through the rest of 2019."
<br><br>
Gus Faucher, a chief economist with PNC Financial Services Group, on signs of a slowing economy.
<br><br>
"We're all seeing slower growth but we are not anywhere near a recession.  The economy is still expanding just with a slightly weaker pay."
<br><br>
So far this year, job gains have averaged 180,000 a month.  So that's down from last year's average of 223,000.
