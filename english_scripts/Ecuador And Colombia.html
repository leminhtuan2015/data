  Katia:
 </strong>
 Hello Felipe, how are you?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Hello, I&#39;m fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Listen, I was thinking you know a lot about Ecuador and Colombia right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  What is it that you like about those two countries or what is it that you don&#39;t like that much or what would you like to change?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well, what I really love of both countries is nature because, you know, my hobby is mountain climbing so I enjoy climbing high mountains in both countries because you have that, you know that in Colombia and Ecuador there is the highlands and you have really, really high mountains so I enjoy that. And also let&#39;s say one thing that I don&#39;t like is that cities are too big, you know, and if you get lost, if you travel to Bogot·, it&#39;s huge so I don&#39;t like cities in Colombia because they&#39;re so big, they&#39;re huge and you
  <span class="audionotes">
   get lost
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  What about in Ecuador? Quito, is it also a big city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well it is a big city but it&#39;s not as big as Bogot·. If you think, you can travel from the south to the north in a couple of hours, maybe two hours, it&#39;s not that
  <span class="audionotes">
   huge
  </span>
  as Bogot·.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  That is so interesting. What about something that you would like to change
  <span class="audionotes">
   perhaps
  </span>
  of Ecuador or Colombia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  Well, the only thing I would like to change is something about tourism because you know that people
  <span class="audionotes">
   overseas
  </span>
  outside of Colombia and Ecuador, they don&#39;t know too much about Colombia and Ecuador. So I don&#39;t know, I think the government should, you know, make people overseas know more about Colombia and Ecuador so that we can attract more tourists to our countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  That is so true. Actually just by knowing more I want to go to Ecuador and Colombia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  There you are, that&#39;s great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  So thank you Felipe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Felipe:
  </strong>
  OK, you&#39;re welcome.
