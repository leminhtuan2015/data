 <strong>
  Alex
 </strong>
 : So how do you feel about long distance relationships?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Not that good. I had two relationships by now and both of them ended after me going somewhere. First time I was in Denmark but like I lived on a school in another city and while I was there for four months like I think two months after I went home to him and broke up and then came back to the school and just didn&#39;t really care. And then the second time I went traveling and I missed him so much and I came back and realized that there was nothing left. I&#39;d lost everything while I was away so I don&#39;t, after one month, after two months, I think it just doesn&#39;t work for me if it&#39;s not really special.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I guess you&#39;re kind of like me. I have to see the person.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Almost, you know, daily.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Exactly and you can have conversations online and on the phone but if there&#39;s no, I don&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t have to be much, just like be close, see each other
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the eye
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : It&#39;s a big difference, yeah. I did a month when I went home to Australia away...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : This summer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, this recent summer and like Skype is just not enough. Do you know what I mean? You can see the person, you can talk to them, you know you can kiss the camera if you want but it&#39;s not...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : If you want.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : You know it&#39;s not the same but that&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t think, some people can do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : I figure if it&#39;s a very, like if the relationship is very, it&#39;s very passionate or you&#39;ve been going on for a long time because both of my relationships were
  <span class="audionotes">
   under one year
  </span>
  I think. The first one was one year and the second one was half a year. So if we&#39;re used to staying together then I think you can work it out. I&#39;m just too impatient.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I guess under a year you haven&#39;t really learned to depend on the other person all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Or...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Still going by the
  <span class="audionotes">
   passion
  </span>
  and if you can&#39;t see the person every day or like whenever you want, then the passion just slowly fades.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, agreed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : But this is your first relationship right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yes it is and I did one month when I went home away from the person and it was just...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria:
  </strong>
  And that was the first time you ever went away from the person?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah and it was just aah horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : I remember the first time I like traveled while my boyfriend was still at home and it was a week and I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   devastated
  </span>
  so it&#39;s, if it&#39;s passionate it&#39;s...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Well I did Christmas away from them when I went to Christmas, I did India for Christmas last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : And two weeks was bad enough and then a month and I was just
  <span class="audionotes">
   pulling my hair out
  </span>
  , do you know? So.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it&#39;s hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : It, yeah, it certainly is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
