  Rebecca:
 </strong>
 So, Diego, I hear that Mexico has some really great food and that you love to cook. What&#39;s your favorite food in Mexico?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  My favorite food in Mexico is chiles en nogada. Chiles means pepper and this is a very traditional Mexican dish because our flag is green, white and red, so this plate, the peppers are green, and then it has a white sauce on top of it and then it has a grain sort of fruit. It&#39;s a red fruit and it&#39;s representing our flag so it&#39;s very... It&#39;s a very historical plate in Mexico. It&#39;s very famous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. I don&#39;t think we have
  <span class="audionotes">
   anything like that
  </span>
  in Australia. It&#39;d be hard to get something that you&#39;d eat that&#39;s blue and red and white.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Blue and red.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Maybe fish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Fish with strawberries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think
  <span class="audionotes">
   that would work
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  So what about tacos? Do you eat them a lot?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we eat them a lot. Tacos is like Mexican fast food, so there&#39;s a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   tacos stands
  </span>
  in Mexico, and you can have them in all sorts of ways: with cheese, with onions, with meat, with different sauces, like green sauce, hot sauce, red sauce. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Do the tortillas... do they
  <span class="audionotes">
   stand up
  </span>
  or are they round ones that always fall over when you go to eat them?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  They&#39;re the round ones and they&#39;re also soft so they&#39;re not corn chips.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Like the ones we get.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Not true Mexican
