 Hello, Christophe. So what is summer like in Belgium?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Well, at first I would like to answer you that summer is much more better than wintertime in Belgium because there is more sunshine, and the days are longer so there is more sunlight during the day, but actually we also have a lot of rain during summer in Belgium, so people are really upset about it, and I think many people also feel really bad about that because there is rain again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Oh, it sounds like it&#39;s raining all year long in Belgium. Which season is actually the nicest one?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  Well, it&#39;s true. Belgium is not a country that you should visit because of the weather because the weather is not really that nice in Belgium.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  So what is actually there to be visited?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  In summer, it&#39;s actually nice to visit Belgium because there are a lot of music festivals. We
  <span class="audionotes">
   even
  </span>
  have one of the biggest and most famous music festivals in the world, where a lot of famous artists come to sing and a lot of people visit the festival, like over 50,000 people on one day. It&#39;s really huge.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Do you often go to that festival?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christophe:
  </strong>
  I went to that festival when I was younger, but right now I stopped going there. It&#39;s too crowded for me. Too many people.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Once
  </span>
  you get older, then you don&#39;t like that anymore. You like to go to more quiet places and smaller festivals. What about you? How is summer like in Lithuania? Is it as cold as in wintertime?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Aiste:
  </strong>
  Oh, no, it is not very cold. Actually in summer we have plus 30, so it means from winter there&#39;s almost 60 degrees change to summer. Further, people are very happy because after the winter and after
  <span class="audionotes">
   a very dark period
  </span>
  when sun comes out, they feel like the can take just a holiday and everybody has to stop working. Everybody&#39;s really happy with the sun getting out of the sky, and it is very popular, especially in July and August. The people take holiday and go to the seaside and spend their time with their families together
  <span class="audionotes">
   while
  </span>
  swimming and enjoying the sun at the beach, and I really like summer. I think Lithuania looks wonderful in summer, and anybody who goes to Lithuania should visit it only in summer because
  <span class="audionotes">
   otherwise
  </span>
  you&#39;ll won&#39;t bring a very good impression out of it.
