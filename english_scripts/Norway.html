  What&#39;s your name?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m Christian.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Christian. And now Christian, where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from Norway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Norway!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, what city in Norway?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s called Proshkura.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Porshkura.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  Yes, it&#39;s close to the capital city, Oslo.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  About 150 kilometers south of Oslo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How many people live in this city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  In my city, 35,000 people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. (Yeah) Oh, wow. That&#39;s pretty small.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  Pretty small. The biggest city in Norway is Oslo and it has 500,000 people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s the biggest!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s the biggest. In total, we have 4 and half million people in Norway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That must be nice being from a small country, I mean big in land but small in people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s nice. It&#39;s not as crowded as Tokyo
  <span class="audiodef">
   to put it that way
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so Tokyo&#39;s what,
  <span class="audiodef">
   three times
  </span>
  the people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  Three times the population of the country, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. That&#39;s crazy. So what&#39;s the best thing about Norway?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  The best thing about Norway, the
  <span class="audiodef">
   clean air
  </span>
  , the blond girls, and the mountains.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you go in the mountains a lot? Do you mountain climb or hike?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  I ski. I ski as often as I can. Probably once a year I go, try to go skiing when I home, and it&#39;s great, I enjoy it, I&#39;ve been doing it all my life so, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So this is downhill skiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  Downhill skiing, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you ever do
  <span class="audiodef">
   cross-country skiing
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Christian:
  </strong>
  Sometimes, I used to do a lot of cross-country skiing when I was younger, but as I got older, it was more downhill skiing. It&#39;s a bit easier. Less
  <span class="audiodef">
   physical
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, thanks Christian.
