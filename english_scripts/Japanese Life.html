   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. I&#39;m back here with Kanade.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Kanade, why don&#39;t you talk about where you&#39;re from.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  OK. I&#39;m from Akita, which is Northern Japan. And there is a lot of mountains and you can see changing color
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the fall
  </span>
  and in my home Yashima town, there are only six thousand people in there and there is a
  <span class="audionotes">
   waterfall
  </span>
  called &#34;
  <em>
   Hotonedake
  </em>
  &#34;, which is the best one hundred fall in Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! That&#39;s cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Yeah, Cool!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you&#39;ve seen it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Yes!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how high is this amazing waterfall?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Uh, I don&#39;t really know. It&#39;s really big.
  <br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really. So is it famous because it&#39;s really tall or cause it&#39;s really wide?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Could be both.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh really, that&#39;s a big waterfall. OK. When is the last time you went home?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Last week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uh-huh. Really? Both you&#39;re parents still live there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. And were your parents born there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Yes, but different town. My father is from Yashima, same
  <span class="audionotes">
   hometown
  </span>
  , same home as my home, but my mom is from Nigaho, next town from Yashima.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Do you have a lot of childhood memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  Yes. Actually but my dad was really busy, so my mom
  <span class="audiodef">
   took me
  </span>
  .
  <span class="audionotes">
   Took me many, many places
  </span>
  ...as a child.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s sweet. Well, you&#39;re a good daughter.
  <br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kanade:
  </strong>
  I think so. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Thanks a lot.
