   Todd
  </strong>
  : So after Laos, where did you go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : After Laos, I flew to Vietnam. And actually I took the bus into Vietnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Yes. And in Vietnam, I traveled from the north, from Hanoi, to Ho Chi Minh City. But because my time was so short, I could only spend one or two days in each city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ah! What city did you like the most?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I think I prefer Hanoi the most. The food, the street food is amazing. It’s a very lively city, lots of motorcycles and traffic so it reminded me of Nigeria where I was born a little bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh cool!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And what did you do in Vietnam?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : I spent time in Hanoi. I also went to visit Sapa, which has a lot of rice
  <span class="audionotes">
   terraces
  </span>
  . So these are mountains where they’ve
  <span class="audionotes">
   planted
  </span>
  rice fields. So the scenery, the view is really beautiful. And you also get to meet the
  <span class="audionotes">
   native
  </span>
  people, the local people there. So I enjoyed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then from there I went to Hoi An, which is a very historical city, very beautiful night
  <span class="audionotes">
   scenery
  </span>
  by the river. And then I went to Ho Chi Minh City but I could only spend one night there before leaving for Myanmar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK. And then, how was Myanmar? What did you do there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Myanmar was my last stop. And I didn’t have so much time there but I
  <span class="audionotes">
   managed
  </span>
  to go—but I managed to visit some of the places I really wanted to see like Yangon, Bagan, and Mandalay.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would say that Bagan was the highlight. They had many temples from the past and just seeing that many of them, it was very
  <span class="audionotes">
   impressive.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That’s fantastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So what country was your favorite?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : It’s hard to say. They each have their own good points but I think I would definitely like to visit Thailand again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh OK. Thailand is such a great place. Anyway, thanks Abidemi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Abidemi
  </strong>
  : Thank you, Todd.
