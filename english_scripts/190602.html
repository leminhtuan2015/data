Police in Virginia Beach, Virginia, are still searching for a motive for Friday's mass shooting in which a disgruntled city worker shot and killed 12 people and wounded four others at a city office building.
<br><br>
Police Chief James Cervera identified the assailant as Dwayne Craddock, an employee of 15 years as an engineer with the city's utilities department.
<br><br>
All but one of the victims worked with Craddock in that department.
<br><br>
The police chief declined to comment on the motive for Friday's rampage which ended with Craddock's death in a gun battle with police.

Agent Ashan Benedict from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said that both weapons used in Friday's shootings were 45 caliber pistols and both had been bought legally.
