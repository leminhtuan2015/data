The United States has announced the deployment of 1,000 additional troops to the Middle East in response to the heightened rhetoric from Iran and has also produced new photographs [that say] that it says show Tehran was behind at least one of the attacks on tanker ships [ships] in the Strait of Hormuz last week.
<br><br>
Iran said early on Monday it will surpass within ten days the limit on the amount of enriched uranium it's allowed to keep under the international agreement unless the other nations in the international agreement on its nuclear program help it withstand the impact of U.S. economic sanctions.
<br><br>
The United States unilaterally pulled out of that international agreement last year.  In early May, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran in retaliation for that withdrawal will stop observing restrictions on its stocks of enriched uranium and heavy-water.  That was agreed to under the 2015 nuclear deal.

Morsi was already serving a seven-year sentence for falsifying documents during the 2012 presidential race.

Britain's Prince Harry is speaking about a new initiative to clear landmines from a wilderness area in Angola.
<br><br>
AP's Karen Chammas is going to report on that just a bit later.  First we'll talk about President Trump's second press secretary Sarah Sanders who is preferring to leave office.  Her predecessor, Sean Spicer, gave VOA an interview on Monday.  He said regular that White House news briefing should absolutely return.
<br><br>
Spicer spoke to VOA on Monday and said the briefings are an opportunity for people to see the government in action and capture media attention in a way that nothing else does.
<br><br>
The White House has not held a news briefing in more than three months.
<br><br>
Sanders is leaving at the end of this month.  She says she and other Trump administration officials make sure they are frequently available to media despite the lack of formal briefings.
<br><br>
Spicer did said that daily briefings are not a necessity and he added that the [Trump administration has turned them into] or during Trump administration, rather, they have turned into what he called "media circuses."
<br><br>
President Trump has not yet named a successor for Sarah Sanders.

<br><br>
[Prince] Britain's Prince Harry is speaking about a new initiative to clear landmines from a wilderness area in Angola and now we have AP's Karen Chammas reporting.
<br><br>
In backing the $60 million initiative of the Angolan government and the Halo Trust, Harry continued work on a cause championed by his late mother, Princess Diana.  Harry recalled her: she famously once drew attention to the African nation's dangerous minefields by stepping onto one.
<br><br>
"I was told just the other day of the positive transformation in Huambo since my mother walked that minefield all those years ago.  What is less well-known is the impact landmines can have on conservation and wildlife, and therefore the economy."
<br><br>
The funds will be used to clear 153 minefields in an area with vital waterways to the Okavango Delta.

The founder of a Chinese telecom giant that has been blacklisted by Washington is speaking out.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Matt Small reports.
<br><br>
Huawei's founder says it never occurred to the Chinese telecom company that the United States would be so determined to take extreme measures against it.
<br><br>
Ren Zhengfei believes "both sides will suffer" and "no one will win," adding the company's revenues will be $30 billion less than forecast over the next two years, and while it'll cut back capacity he insists that restrictions put in place last month by the federal government, in his words, will not stop us.
<br><br>
U.S. officials have accused Chinese telecom companies like Huawei of stealing trade secrets and threatening cyber security possibly on orders of the ruling Communist party.
