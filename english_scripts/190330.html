U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday the Justice Department is preparing to release a redacted version of the special counsel's confidential report on the Russia investigation soon.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Mike Gracia reports.
<br><br>
Attorney General William Barr plans to deliver to Congress a version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation by mid-April.
<br><br>
Barr sent a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Jerrold Nadler on Friday.  Graham hairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, Nadler chairs the House Judiciary Committee.
<br><br>
In his letter, the attorney general says he wants the public to be able to read Mueller's findings.  Barr says the Mueller report is nearly 400 pages long.
<br><br>
Mueller submitted his confidential report to Barr on Friday, March 22.

President Trump said Friday he'll close the southern U.S. border next week if Mexico does not stop illegal immigration, especially the Central American migrants who are making their way to the country.
<br><br>
"They can stop them.  But they chose not to.  Now they got to stop them.  If they don't stop them, we're closing the border.  We'll close it and we'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games."
<br><br>
When questioned by reporters in Florida, Mr. Trump said it could mean all trade with Mexico.
<br><br>
He has previously threatened to close the border, including at a rally in Michigan Thursday night, but this time, he gave a timetable.
<br><br>
<br><br>
The White House says American and Chinese trade negotiators made progress during "candid and constructive discussions" in Beijing on Friday and they will continue talks in Washington next week.
<br><br>
The two sides are working to strike a deal to lift tariffs affecting $250 billion of Chinese imports to the U.S. and about $110 billion of American exports to China.
<br><br>
This comes amid a report by the Bureau of Economic Analysis that the U.S. trade deficit with China again rose in 2018.

British lawmakers rejected the government's Brexit deal for a third time Friday, leaving the UK facing the prospect of a chaotic departure from the European Union in just two weeks with political leaders in turmoil and the country ill-prepared.
<br><br>
Reuters Lucy Fielder has details.
<br><br>
"The noes have it.  Unlock."  "This House has rejected no deal.  It has rejected no Brexit.  On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table.  And today it has rejected approving the Withdrawal Agreement alone ...."
<br><br>
Now the British prime minister's position hangs in the balance.  She promised to quit if the deal is passed.
<br><br>
Now many, even her own party, are saying her time is up anyway.
<br><br>
This is an emotive day for Brexiteers, the day Britain was supposed to leave the European Union.
<br><br>
Clouds descended on Parliament, some of them at the end of a Brexit betrayal protest march across England to push their message that Britain must get out, regardless of party politics.
<br><br>
That's Reuters Lucy Fielder reporting.

Aid agencies in central Mozambique are recovering more bodies in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai.
<br><br>
Mozambique says 138 cholera cases have been detected in the city of Beira.
<br><br>
VOA's Mohammed Yusuf reports.
<br><br>
Aid agencies in the port city are scaling up their operations to feed the hungry and treat the sick.
<br><br>
But aid agencies are also finding more bodies, says Mozambique's Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia.
<br><br>
"In terms of the number who lost their lives, we have increased to 493.  This is because we are getting information from the villages that we didn't know before.  Our main concern now is to make sure that we avoid an outbreak of cholera.  So we will be vaccinating 800,000 people."
<br><br>
More than 130 cases of cholera have been reported in Beira so far.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, areas of Mozambique's cyclone-ravaged coast remain cut off by flooding that left many homeless.
<br><br>
That's VOA's Mohammed Yusuf reporting.

Algerians took to the streets by the millions for the sixth straight Friday trying to push their ailing president from power and bring down an entire political system seen as corrupt and out of touch.
<br><br>
A crowd broke through a blockaded street leading the presidential palace.  Otherwise, the protests have been peaceful.
<br><br>
For the first time, all three state TV channels showed the protests live since the mass marches started in February.  It also reflected the changing balance of power as President Abdelaziz Bouteflika loses key supporters.
<br><br>
