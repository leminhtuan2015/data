 : Hey Katia. What about you? Tell me about your weekends. What do you usually do on the weekends?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Well, every weekend I think it&#39;s different but usually in the mornings I wake up and I&#39;m actually very relaxed because I know I don&#39;t have a schedule so usually I have coffee, breakfast and then I plan my weekend. So sometimes I do things only
  <span class="audionotes">
   by myself
  </span>
  but sometimes I go with friends. I like going to restaurants, I like being in nature, I like biking, so there are many things but I think every weekend is different. It depends on how I&#39;m feeling that day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Nice. You were saying you plan your weekends, like you can plan them
  <span class="audionotes">
   in advance
  </span>
  or something that just as it goes, kind of like do things. How does it work?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Well usually in the mornings I check what I feel like doing and then that&#39;s what I plan. So for example, if I wake up and I feel like going, it&#39;s a nice day, I like to go to a park and then to the beach, then that&#39;s my plan so that&#39;s how I plan it. It&#39;s right on the moment. So it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   somewhat
  </span>
  of a plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : You look like you enjoy going shopping a lot. Do you go shopping sometimes on the weekends?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Not at all. I don&#39;t like shopping at all. I wish I would enjoy it but I just, all the time it&#39;s the same. You see the same things, the same people, so it&#39;s the same all the time so it&#39;s not so exciting for me. I really don&#39;t enjoy it. Only I go if I have to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Do you have your friends over or do you usually go visit friends or family during the weekends?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Sometimes I have my friends over. Usually have a small dinner, nice conversations and yeah just
  <span class="audionotes">
   a quiet evening
  </span>
  with my friends. And yes, and Sundays are family days so I
  <span class="audionotes">
   reserve
  </span>
  Sundays for my family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Do you travel or do you go places around your city?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : If I have the opportunity definitely. I think it&#39;s always nice to go out from your everyday routine. So if I can, of course I love to travel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s interesting.
