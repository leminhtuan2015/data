  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Hello!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Hello!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Can you say your name please?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sure. My name is Raphael Thibault
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Thibault!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah! Thibault!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and that&#39;s your last name?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Ah, yeah, it&#39;s my last name, but it&#39;s a first name too in France.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah! It&#39;s quite traditional. It&#39;s from the middle ages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, Where are you from in France?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  I just finished my studies in Paris, but I was born in the South. Actually, it&#39;s the place they make foie gras. If you know about foie gras.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  We used to eat on Christmas and..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What exactly is foie gras? Sorry, it&#39;s hard for me to say.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s from the duck. It&#39;s um, how do you call it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The liver?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the liver! That&#39;s it. The liver, and it&#39;s cooked an official way and you can have it both like cold or hot, I mean, any kind, but the point is, the duck has to be fed in nature, right! It&#39;s not working if it&#39;s in a, industrial feeding duck
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  It doesn&#39;t produce really good foie gras, yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So the duck must come from nature?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  that&#39;s why this place is famous for because it&#39;s countryside. There&#39;s no really big cities and most of the people are farmers so they actually produce some really good foie gras, like I heard the competition comes from East Europe now but they make more like industrial foie gras. It&#39;s a little different, but anyway, that&#39;s the place I&#39;m born.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! Is that the eastern side or the western side?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s the southwest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, towards Spain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s it. Exactly! Like below Bordeaux, a city called Bordeaux, it&#39;s a bit below this city.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so Bordeaux is known for wine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, is it near the mountains or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not that close to Spain. It&#39;s, how can I say, yeah, it&#39;s not the extremity of France, it&#39;s more like center-south, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. Sounds like a pretty place though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  What?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It sounds like a pretty place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raphael:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, it&#39;s quite nice. It&#39;s quite nice. I mean, it&#39;s countryside right. You have to like it. There&#39;s not a lot of things to do, but, I spend like my, from fifteen years old, I live there and then I moved to another city called La Rochelle, which is close to the sea, just in front of the sea actually, and that&#39;s a better place. I like it much.
