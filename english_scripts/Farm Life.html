   Todd:
  </strong>
  Monica, you mentioned a farm home stay in New Zealand. Have you ever actually ever lived on a farm?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  I haven&#39;t lived on a farm
  <span class="audionotes">
   as such
  </span>
  , but I&#39;ve visited family friends who have lived on farms.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did you like it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I remember loving visiting my family friends on farms. Yeah, especially riding horses. I loved riding horses when I was young.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So are you good? Are you an equestrian professional?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   I wouldn&#39;t say that
  </span>
  . I do remember one time. My mother always seems to tell people this story about when I was young, and we were at her friend&#39;s farm. I was on a horse, and the horse took off, and I was only about, I think ten at the time and I was
  <span class="audionotes">
   hanging off
  </span>
  the side of this horse and my mother was really worried for me, and then when the horse finally stopped she ... you know ... she came running up and asked me if I was OK and things, and apparently I said to her, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s OK. I wanted it to go fast.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s cute. You&#39;re lucky you didn&#39;t get hurt though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Yeah, well, I guess I just didn&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   sense the danger
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, I kind of grew up on a farm. My grandfather had a ranch growing up so I spend every summer on his ranch, so I have quite the ... I don&#39;t know ... I guess I have a lot of experience on a farm. Yeah, it&#39;s good. I remember when I was young I thought the life on a farm was just the best. I mean I had it so good, and I loved everything about living on a farm and I thought when I was gonna get older, I would want to be on a farm, but now that I&#39;m older, I couldn&#39;t image doing it every again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  What can&#39;t you imagine doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know, I guess, I just couldn&#39;t imagine all that work, and I think I&#39;m just so addicted to city life or
  <span class="audionotes">
   suburban life
  </span>
  and living in a house and just doing work on computers and things like that. I couldn&#39;t go back to that lifestyle, but when I was young, I have to admit, I enjoyed it a lot. So how about you? Could you see yourself moving and living on a farm?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monica:
  </strong>
  Well, yeah, I think my thoughts are similar to yours in that I&#39;m very used to being inside using a computer, and I&#39;m used to a very different lifestyle to one that involves being on a farm, but yeah, I&#39;ve never had a long period of time where I&#39;ve stayed on a farm like you so yeah maybe it&#39;s a bit different for me.
