  Mari:
 </strong>
 Hi, I&#39;m Mari. I&#39;m here with my friend Ron. Today, we&#39;re talking about food. So Ron, what&#39;s your favorite cuisine?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  My favorite cuisine has to be Hawaiian food. I grew up eating Hawaiian food so every
  <span class="audionotes">
   special occasion
  </span>
  we had Hawaiian food, so now when I eat Hawaiian food, it always
  <span class="audionotes">
   brings back good memories
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What exactly is Hawaiian food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Traditional Hawaiian food is usually cooked under the ground in a hole with hot rocks and it cooks for maybe six hours or seven hours and when you take it out, it&#39;s very salty because we use a lot of salt and it tastes really good ... usually meat ... usually pork and other vegetables like taro and potato.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  So then what&#39;s your favorite Hawaiian dish?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  My favorite Hawaiian dish is called Lao-Lao. It&#39;s pork or fish wrapped in leaves and put inside the
  <span class="audionotes">
   underground
  </span>
  oven and it&#39;s very salty and very good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  So the flavor is just salt?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  The flavor is salt and also the leaf flavor that it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   wrapped
  </span>
  in.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s your favorite dessert or junk food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  My favorite dessert has to be cake and ice-cream together. I love to eat cake and ice-cream together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s your favorite ice-cream flavor?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  My favorite ice-cream flavor is strawberry, and I like to eat that with chocolate cake.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Mm, sounds good. Do you like vegetables?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Not so much. I don&#39;t like to eat vegetables but I can eat them if somebody cooks them for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s your favorite vegetable?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  My favorite vegetable ... I don&#39;t have a favorite vegetable but I can eat vegetables like asparagus, broccoli, carrots. Those types of things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Do you eat your vegetables raw ... like salad ... or do you prefer them cooked?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  I
  <span class="audionotes">
   prefer
  </span>
  them cooked.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  Thanks Ron.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
