  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Julia, we&#39;re talking about types of people and we have some more that we can discuss. So the next one is worry wart. Are you a
  <span class="audionotes">
   worry wart
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I guess when it comes to some things maybe yeah. Like sometimes I get
  <span class="audionotes">
   insomnia
  </span>
  and I know it&#39;s because my brain is worrying about stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. You just can&#39;t let it go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, which is kind of why I took up yoga and meditation because just calming down those, you know, those thoughts that are just going crazy round in your head. So I would be a worry wart if it wasn&#39;t for my yoga practice. I think the yoga helps me keep my mind calm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  But I have that natural tendency I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so what about things around the house? Are you a clean freak?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  No. No, I am messy, like ridiculously messy. I don&#39;t see mess. I don&#39;t see it. It&#39;s like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   blind spot
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you&#39;re a slob?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yes, kind of, yes and this is the one thing that drives my husband crazy because he&#39;s very tidy, he&#39;s very clean, very neat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you guys are
  <span class="audionotes">
   yin and yang
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah. He likes things to go in the proper place and he likes things to be tidied up, put away and for him it&#39;s very, it&#39;s a sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   therapeutic
  </span>
  thing. It&#39;s, I guess, the mirror of his mental state. If there&#39;s a mess going on he feels
  <span class="audionotes">
   uneasy
  </span>
  so he needs to tidy up in order to kind of be focused and calm. I&#39;m kind of the opposite. If everything&#39;s too tidy and neat, I get a bit
  <span class="audionotes">
   freaked out
  </span>
  . I like, I&#39;m comfortable in mess, very comfortable in mess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Comfortable in chaos?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well that leads us to the next one and maybe this relates to your husband. Is he a control freak?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yes. Absolutely. He is, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So can you explain what a control freak is?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  A control freak is someone who likes to be in control, has to be in control all the time over all things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And if there&#39;s not, if there&#39;s disorder or something left?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  It causes him stress. It causes him stress so just simple things like maybe like a house guest. While he&#39;s a very friendly and generous and warm person, having an extra person in the house makes him uneasy because it&#39;s a factor that&#39;s out of his control.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hm, yeah. So how about other things like are you a, like a video game junkie or TV
  <span class="audionotes">
   junkie
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  There are certain games that I have to take off my phone because they will eat away my time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, like Angry Birds and stuff like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Stuff like that. The ones that, just really simplistic ones, things like Tetris and putting squares in boxes and Bejeweled where you change, moving things around. Those kind of games I can get very readily addicted to so I have to, I have to be careful, I take them off. I had like a brief intense
  <span class="audionotes">
   fling
  </span>
  with TechM, like those fighting games. I was really into fights, fighting games and playing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s hard core.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, but it was shortlived and I felt like it was an unhealthy obsession.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you can, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  But yeah it was great. I enjoyed it when I did it. It was fun.
 </p>
