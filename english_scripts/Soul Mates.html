   So how did you meet?

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   We met through the school. I can&#39;t actually remember the first day we met because being students we kind of meet people and stuff like that but we spent some time together at a party and a friend&#39;s birthday party.

    Todd:

   Oh, OK, now you come from two completely different cultures.
  </font>
 </p>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   Yeah we do.

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Can you talk a little about that?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   Well, Kwame&#39;s from Ghana and I&#39;m from New Zealand. Ghana is in West Africa, and, gosh, they&#39;re very different. I&#39;ve never been to Ghana but Kwame came to New Zealand and we basically come from one of the two most different cultures you can probably imagine, but being in Japan, I think, when we met in Japan and we were in the same culture so it&#39;s not like he was visiting New Zealand or I was visiting Ghana because there was not real culture shock or we&#39;ve kind of
   <span class="style5">
    <a href="/NotesAudio0601/622-1-assimilate.mp3">
     assimilated to each other&#39;s cultures
    </a>
   </span>
   very much so in our own relationship we&#39;re pretty much no cultural problems or anything like that, (right) yeah.

 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, I think it&#39;s easiear cause you&#39;re in a

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Well, what are some things that you have in common?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   Ah, things we have in common? We both like watching TV. Kwame likes watching TV a bit more than I do. We both like basketball and soccer. But Kwame&#39;s very
   <span class="style4">
    <a href="/NotesAudio0601/622-3-passionate.mp3">
     passionate about that
    </a>

   So, do you watch the NBA?

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Do you both support the same team?

 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   I support players. (Oh, I see) I&#39;m not really a team person but, but Kwame supports teams but I&#39;m very passionate about the players because we also play this Playstation game. NBA LIVE! and any player that&#39;s on the Playstation game, I kind of

    <a href="/NotesAudio0601/622-4-have-a-bond.mp3">
     have this bond

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   OK, well, how about, what do you guys, what&#39;s different about you? Like do you have different personalities or anything like that?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Lucinda:
   </strong>
   Yeah, we have very different, I think we have the exact opposite for personalities. Kwame is very quiet and
   <span class="style5">
    <a href="/NotesAudio0601/622-5-reserved.mp3">
     he&#39;s very reserved
    </a>
   </span>
   in his opinions for certain things. He won&#39;t say whether he really likes something or if he dislikes something, whereas I&#39;m very opinionated and I like to have my say over everything so I talk a lot and I, even if it&#39;s on what type of soap we use, I have a very strong opinion on what it should be and, yeah.
