   Todd
  </strong>
  : So Meg, are you busy this weekend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yes, I&#39;m so busy because I&#39;m moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of work to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : What do you have to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : First, I have to prepare my apartment, so I need to pack all of my things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s not fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : No, it takes a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you need help?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah, do you have time to help me?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I can help you on Sunday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Ooh, are you busy on Saturday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, on Saturday I have to work. I have to teach two classes, and then after I teach, I have to grade papers. Oh, it sounds like you&#39;re really busy too. Plus, I have to meet my friends that evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, what will you do with your friends?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m helping my friend also. My friend has
  <span class="audionotes">
   car problems
  </span>
  , so I have to take him to the
  <span class="audionotes">
   mechanic
  </span>
  , but on Sunday I can help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : OK, that would be great because on Sunday I have to take some trash to the
  <span class="audionotes">
   dump
  </span>
  , and I have to finish some
  <span class="audionotes">
   paperwork
  </span>
  at city hall to prepare for moving to a new country
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Now, because you&#39;re moving, do you have to go to the post office?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I do have to go to the post office. I almost forgot. At the post office, I have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   submit a form
  </span>
  to say my new address.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Ah, that&#39;s good because I have to go to the post office, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I have to send my mom&#39;s birthday gift to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : When is your mom&#39;s birthday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It was one month ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Ah, so you have to send it quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yes, I have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get on it
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : OK, well, let&#39;s go together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So, I&#39;ll see you Sunday. What time should I be here?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I have to go to city hall by three p.m., so can you come at two?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK, but if you want to go to the dump, the dump closes at noon, so we have to leave early.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Ah, OK. Can you come at eleven?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yes. OK, so I will see you at eleven o&#39;clock.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Great, see you then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Bye.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Bye.
