  What is your favorite movie?

   <strong>
    Jamie:

  My favorite movie is kind of a
  <span class="audionotes">
   heavy movie
  </span>
  . It&#39;s a called Sophie&#39;s Choice with Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.

  It&#39;s a movie, it&#39;s set in World War II. Meryl Streep plays a Polish woman who has come to America and she&#39;s met a man, Kevin Kline. Who has a series of problems of his own, mostly psychological which she is not 100 percent
  <span class="audionotes">
   aware of
  </span>
  and she does a bunch of scenes where she thinks of the past and the very difficult decision she had while during the war living in Poland. She had to decide between two children which one would be murdered by the Nazis and which one wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s an
  <span class="audionotes">
   ethical delimma
  </span>
  that she faced at that time. She made and immediate decision on and it affected her the rest of her life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.

  It&#39;s a fantastic movie. Not the story in itself, of course the story was brilliant but the acting, the fact that she speaks Polish, she speaks German, she speaks English with a Polish accent which is amazing. A writer who is actually a narrator to the movie as well, his character is great. Kevin Kline&#39;s basically a
  <span class="audionotes">
   psycho character
  </span>
  . He is a little bit deranged in itself is pretty neat.
  <span class="audionotes">
   All in all
  </span>
  , the characters, the plot line, the movie it&#39;s fanatasic.

  OK. Great. Sophie&#39;s Choice.

  Sophie&#39;s Choice. I think it actually won an academy award in 1985 or &#39;84.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Great. Thanks a lot.
