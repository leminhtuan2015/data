   Silvia
  </strong>
  : Hi, my name is Silvia. I&#39;m from Guatemala.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  And I&#39;m Diego and I&#39;m from Mexico. And today we&#39;re going to talk about ruins in our countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Actually, Guatemala is quite famous for it&#39;s Mayan ruins. We have a lot of them all over the country but especially up in the north near Mexico, and the most famous one is Tikal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow, have you been there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;ve been there and now
  <span class="audionotes">
   apparently
  </span>
  they&#39;re discovering more ruins around that area so every year you can go and just go visit a new ruin. So it&#39;s quite interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  The people in Guatemala often go to see these places or is it usually tourists?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s mainly tourists, but yeah, I&#39;ve known a lot of people that just like to go, especially with my parents. They love
  <span class="audionotes">
   archeology
  </span>
  so they&#39;re taking us every time and seeing different places. They also discovered a new one that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   getting a lot attention
  </span>
  from the media lately. Apparently it&#39;s the biggest temple in the world, so it&#39;s getting a lot of media attention and now they even made a kind of like a
  <span class="an">
   replica
  </span>
  at the Shiang Hai Expo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah. But the only way you can go there right now is by helicopter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  So it&#39;s a bit expensive to get there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is, so a lot of celebrities apparently have flown there but for Guatemalans, I don&#39;t think many Guatemalans have been there yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah, maybe because it&#39;s difficult to be able to afford that. We also have Mayan ruins in Mexico. Have you ever been to Cancun?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I went to TuTulmas around there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes, Tulumas is a very nice Mayan site because it&#39;s on a cliff and you see all of the ocean and it&#39;s really nice. The
  <span class="audionotes">
   contrast between
  </span>
  the buildings and the white sand and the blue ocean. It&#39;s really, really beautiful. And we also have Chiciniza, which is like a Mayan pyramid. Have you ever heard of it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve heard of it, but I haven&#39;t been there yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it was voted one of the seven wonders of the modern world, so it&#39;s really, really nice and it&#39;s really large, and unlike the pyramids in Egypt, like on the top it&#39;s flat so it&#39;s a bit different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, mainly the Guatemalan ruins are also a little bit flat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think that was like Mayan architecture. It was flat on the top.
