   Hana
  </strong>
  : So Daniel, I heard you went on a vacation, where did you go?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I went to Taiwan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Oh, sounds interesting. What did you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well, I did a lot of things. It&#39;s a really interesting place. I saw
  <span class="audionotes">
   a lot of
  </span>
  culture. I saw a lot of history. I went to beautiful places. They have like really, really beautiful nature. Everything was really, really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : How was the food?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well, the food in Taiwan is amazing.
  <span class="audionotes">
   You wouldn&#39;t believe
  </span>
  how good it is. Everything tastes amazing. And
  <span class="audionotes">
   the good thing about it
  </span>
  , it&#39;s really, really cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : I see. Who did you go with?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : I went with a Taiwanese friend, so that was really good because I cannot speak Mandarin. And my friend helped me
  <span class="audionotes">
   a lot
  </span>
  with all the food, and that was really good because I really appreciated that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : How long did you go for?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : It was about eight days. And I think it was more than enough to get like a quick view of the whole island. It was really nice to go from Taipei in the north to some cities in the south. I think I got a really good impression of what Taiwan is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : Why did you go to Taiwan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well I&#39;m really interested in Asia and Asian cultures, and since it&#39;s really far from my background, I really want to get to know better all those cultures. And
  <span class="audionotes">
   since
  </span>
  for many western people are quite the same, I really want to find out those differences. And that&#39;s why I chose Taiwan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hana
  </strong>
  : I see.
