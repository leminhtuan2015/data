   Todd:
  </strong>
  Jason, I saw that you have an amazing tattoo on your chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right, yeah, I&#39;m not Yakuza though, so don&#39;t worry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s the
  <span class="audiodef">
   reasoning
  </span>
  behind the tattoo? Why did you get it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  I got the tattoo because I used to actually work as a tattooist, a long time ago but now I stopped that, so I can come traveling. I
  <span class="audiodef">
   designed
  </span>
  the tattoo myself. I drew it onto paper then I got my friend to actually tattoo it onto my body. I got a wolf really because I really love animals, and a wolf is my favorite animal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you drew the tattoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  I drew the tattoo, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Did it hurt when it was being
  <span class="audiodef">
   sketched
  </span>
  in your body?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it did hurt, but tattoos can
  <span class="audiodef">
   vary
  </span>
  in amounts of pain depending where on your body it was. The chest is probably the worst place, which is where my tattoo is, so it hurt.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why is the chest the worst place?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jason:
  </strong>
  Because there&#39;s not much
  <span class="audiodef">
   meat
  </span>
  there, kind of, because there is a lot of bone. And, the closer to the bone it is, and the thinner the skin the more painful it&#39;s going to be.
