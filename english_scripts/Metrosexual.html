  Daniel:
 </strong>
 Well we&#39;re talking about men and being macho and stuff like that but recently there&#39;s the whole thing about being
 <span class="audionotes">
  metrosexual
 </span>
 , right? What do you think about that?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I have no problem with, you know, metrosexual because I think, you know, everyone has the right to look good and to take care of themselves even for men.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Uh, uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  For example, David Beckham, he&#39;s one example of metrosexual guys and I think he looks amazing with the underwear he dresses. Yeah, I have no problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah but like one thing it&#39;s about how you dress and, because metrosexual people they don&#39;t, I mean they do care of a lot of other things not only clothes, right? They take care of their hair, I don&#39;t know, their faces. I don&#39;t know, so many things they do that not a lot of people do especially men. You know, they take care of their nails, their hands and for some people that might be a bit weird. What do you think as a woman? Do you like it, you don&#39;t? It&#39;s too much? What is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m OK with that, just not
  <span class="audionotes">
   too much
  </span>
  though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Like for example, I mean guys in rock bands they usually wear makeup, like eyeliner, and I&#39;m actually really into that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  And I don&#39;t know if you know this guy called Adam Lambert, he was the winner of American Idol last season.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  And he wears a lot of, you know, eyeliner and yeah I think it&#39;s pretty cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  But I don&#39;t know, as a girl for example, because OK usually makeup and stuff like that are more related to girls, right? So what if your boyfriend is a metrosexual and he knows or he has more makeup than you have, how does that make you feel?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Well I wouldn&#39;t, you know, choose a metrosexual guy to be my boyfriend but, you know, I think it&#39;s OK for guys to wear makeup just not too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Uh, uh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I mean only
  <span class="audionotes">
   eyeliner
  </span>
  I think is fine but if he starts wearing
  <span class="audionotes">
   blusher
  </span>
  or
  <span class="audionotes">
   lipstick
  </span>
  , you know, there&#39;s something wrong with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK. So how about all the other things they do that they take care a lot of their bodies? How about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s totally fine, you know, taking care of yourself. I think it shows that you really care about, you know, how you look.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  I had a discussion with a female friend before and she totally agreed that boys should take care of themselves like a bit more because I mean, yeah, the whole macho thing I think it&#39;s appealling but at the same time I don&#39;t think, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that like boys expect girls to take care of themselves and to be pretty, to look pretty, I don&#39;t know makeup, the hair, the nails, but boys sometimes, I mean I don&#39;t think girls want to go out with a monkey, you know. It&#39;s like, you have to take care of themselves, of yourself, it&#39;s not fair that girls have to put all the effort and boys, you know, just don&#39;t do anything. So I agree with the thing that, I mean it&#39;s all right, we have to take care of ourselves and we have to try to look better but I&#39;m not used to the whole makeup and stuff so personally I don&#39;t do it and I don&#39;t think I will be comfortable doing it. So I don&#39;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  Absolutely, I agree. What about in Chilean culture? How do they take metrosexual? Is there a big issue or people just don&#39;t care?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a big issue. We&#39;re not really used to have people, I mean boys wearing makeup and stuff like that. So when you see somebody doing it, it&#39;s kind of like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a shock
  </span>
  . It&#39;s not really clear if he&#39;s a metrosexual or he&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   gay
  </span>
  like because in Chile that&#39;s a big issue still. So, but more and more people are accepting that. I mean, OK, if you wear makeup all right. If you, I don&#39;t know, do your nails, OK, but it&#39;s not really common. It&#39;s more for like people who are, I don&#39;t know, singers, actors or stuff like that. Not really common people do it still at least. How about in Indonesia? How is the, how do people take that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  I mean like metrosexual you can define it in, you know, so many ways. If guys wear makeup or guys dressing up, you know, really fancy, well I hardly, you know, see any man in Indonesia wearing makeup but a lot of them, you know, dress really fancy and I think we don&#39;t have a problem with that and a lot of, you know, my friends, young teenagers, they really
  <span class="audionotes">
   dig
  </span>
  that. They&#39;re really into, you know, guys who dress up really fancy so it&#39;s not an issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not an issue. OK. Like it&#39;s getting more popular, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Vella:
  </strong>
  It is and a lot of my friends are really metrosexual.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  OK, that&#39;s good. Thanks.
