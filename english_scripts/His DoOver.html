  : So Adam, today we’re talking about do-overs. So what is something that you wish you would have done over? For example, maybe something in your university life?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : Yeah. There are a few things. I might change my major. I studied education, and while I enjoy what I’m doing right now, my free time I really like watching movies about science and astronomy. And if I would go back to school and start my studies over, I’d probably study something
  <span class="audionotes">
   along those lines
  </span>
  , astronomy and metaphysics or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think that those topics are really interesting and
  <span class="audionotes">
   on the cutting edge
  </span>
  of science and just fascinating to explore.
 </p>

   Sarah
  </b>
  : Interesting. Anything else you wish you would have done?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : I might have been more involved in the sports clubs at my school. For example, the American football team. I played in high school but in college, I wanted to play but I didn’t have the motivation to
  <span class="audionotes">
   push me over the edge
  </span>
  to actually go out and really
  <span class="audionotes">
   put my heart into it
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I went to one training day and kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   tried out
  </span>
  , but I didn’t really pursue it as much as I would have liked. I think it would have been fun to be a part of that culture and that environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : How about something that you did do that maybe now you wish you hadn’t?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : I pierced my ears in high school because that was the cool thing to do. But now I don’t wear earrings. And yeah, looking back on it, kind of just a silly thing to do that I’m trying to follow the trends, that, you know, trends usually
  <span class="audionotes">
   pass
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  So yeah, that would be something that I wouldn’t do again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Sarah
  </b>
  : Nice. Anything else you would have changed?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Adam
  </b>
  : I might have made different decisions about my girlfriends at the time. I had a really good girlfriend in the beginning of college, and things didn’t work out because of a variety of reasons. But I think if we would have worked on it, we could have. We could have made it, made it happen. So yeah, that’s something I think about sometimes about life in college.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s always, you know, college love is kind of a crazy thing. So yeah, we’re too much like kids, I guess, I think at that age.
 </p>

  : Okay. Thanks, Adam.
