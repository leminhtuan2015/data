   Ron:
  </strong>
  Hi, I&#39;m Ron from Hawaii. I&#39;m here with Mari from Japan. Today we&#39;re going to be talking about entertainment, and how often we do these things. So Mari, how often do you watch TV?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I watch the news in the morning and when I come home at night I sometimes watch TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Do you have a favorite TV show?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t have a favorite TV show.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  OK. How often do you go to the movies?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I really like going to the movies. I think I go maybe once a month or maybe once every two months.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  And other than that do you rent movies?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t rent movies but sometimes I download movies. I like to watch comedies -
  <span class="audionotes">
   romantic comedies
  </span>
  - and a little bit of drama.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  What is your favorite movie you&#39;ve watch
  <span class="audionotes">
   recently
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  My favorite movie... I don&#39;t know if it was my favorite movie, but a movie that I watched recently is called &#34;27 Dresses&#34;. It is about a girl, or a woman, who is a
  <span class="audionotes">
   bridesmaid
  </span>
  twenty-seven times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  And that&#39;s a romantic comedy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  It is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Interesting. What about reading? Do you like to read books?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I do like to read books. Right now, I&#39;m really busy with work so I don&#39;t have a lot of time to read but when I&#39;m on vacation or whenever I have free time, I like to read books.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  What kind of books?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I like to read
  <span class="audionotes">
   non-fiction
  </span>
  usually.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Biographies
  </span>
  of people, and I also like to read about like teaching practices so that I can become a better teacher and a little bit of fiction.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  And what about concerts? Do you enjoy going to concerts?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mari:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t go to music concerts. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been to one actually but I like to go see musicals and I also like to go to sporting events.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ron:
  </strong>
  Nice talking with you Mari.
