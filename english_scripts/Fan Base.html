   After the Gig. Eoin is talking about what happens after one of his performances with is band.
  </span>
  <br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, usually, do people come up and talk to you after the show, or are people usually kind of shy and they don&#39;t know how to approach you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, so that&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   another thing
  </span>
  . I mean we have a CD stall and some people are very forward and they&#39;ll come and instantly like
  <span class="audionotes">
   rush up
  </span>
  and buy a CD but I think in Japan, especially it seems like people are kind of shyer about approaching you so giving out a questionnaire and asking people write it, it gives them an excuse to come up and talk to you anyway if they&#39;re interested later. So yeah, whenever we&#39;ve given out questionnaires, it seems like we sell more CDs on those days.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Then you just actually pass this out to the audience?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Normally there&#39;s
  <span class="style5">
   not that huge a number
  </span>
  of people there, maybe forty or fifty people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  Maybe a few more. It depends on the night. So this is... what I&#39;m describing here is for a gig that&#39;s sort of away from home, you know. We played a concert just recently in Oita where we live and that was more of an event that we organized so we pretty much knew most of the people who had come anyway. In that case we played for longer, didn&#39;t do the questionnaire thing and just went out drinking after the gig. It was a more relaxed event on the night and afterwards but of course preparing for it in advance required a lot more effort - making sure people came and calling other bands to come and play with us and that sort of side of things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So do you have a fan base? A big fan base?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s massive but, yeah I guess when we play in Oita normally somewhere between, on a good day maybe 35, 40.
  <span class="audionotes">
   On a bad day
  </span>
  15 to 20 people will come and see us.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Still, that&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Eoin:
  </strong>
  But, I mean, that&#39;s more, you know, we have to
  <span class="audionotes">
   pro-actively
  </span>
  contact them and say &#34;Hey, you wanna come and see the band?&#34; It&#39;s not like we just put
  <span class="audionotes">
   an advert
  </span>
  in the paper and
  <span class="style10">
   everyone turns up
  </span>
  , unfortunately.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, hey, you know. Give it time.
