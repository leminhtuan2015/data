   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Mark, we&#39;ve been talking about places that you&#39;ve traveled, things that you have done. What about people that go to your country, England? Can you recommend three or four good places to go to in England?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Right. Well,
  <span class="audionotes">
   obviously
  </span>
  , most people should visit London. Personally, I don&#39;t like London. It&#39;s too busy and too expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But,
  <span class="audionotes">
   wait a minute
  </span>
  , you&#39;re saying that people should visit it but you don&#39;t like it. Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  They should visit it because you have to go once to see all the famous places such a Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace,
  <span class="audionotes">
   just to say you&#39;ve been
  </span>
  , but if you arrive in London, I&#39;d say spend maybe one or two days there and then move and you can move to cheaper places. My favorite place in England is in the North of England. It&#39;s called the Lake District.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The Lake District.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is very, very beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, I take it there&#39;s many lakes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. There&#39;s got to be about twenty or thirty lakes up there and the scenery&#39;s beautiful. Famous for Peter Rabbit. Do you know Peter Rabbit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, the fairy tale.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right. The children&#39;s character. Yeah. The writer, Beatrice Potter, she was born in the Lake District, so that&#39;s how she got her
  <span class="audionotes">
   inspiration
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So if you go the Lake District, now are you talking about camping or do you stay in a like
  <span class="audionotes">
   a bed-and-breakfast
  </span>
  , or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you can stay in a bed-and-breakfast. You can camp. You can stay in pubs or inns, or there are many hotels. It&#39;s very organized for the tourists in the Lake District. Yeah, and it&#39;s not such a big area, so you can travel around there by bus, or by car pretty easy. Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so that&#39;s two. Anymore?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark:
  </strong>
  Actually, I&#39;ve never been but I&#39;d probably recommend Scotland, but I&#39;ve never been. But Edinburgh Castle is very famous. Also, York. The city of York, in Yorkshire is very beautiful as well. That was famous for the Vikings in the olden days, so it has a beautiful big cathedral and all the old viking walls, so if you like history then England is a beautiful place to visit. There are many places. You have Stratford-upon-Avon for Shakespeare, Oxford which is a famous university city, so if you like history then England is great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, sounds good. Thanks, Mark.
