   JJ:
  </strong>
  Look at them all
  <span class="keyword">
   lean in
  </span>
  as I tell this story. It starts out
  <span class="audionotes">
   sickeningly sweet
  </span>
  . I was in a musical, Cinderella. I was Cinderella and the guy who played the prince and I started to date.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  We
  <span class="audionotes">
   got pretty serious.
  </span>
  He was trying to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get rid of an
  </span>
  <span class="keyword">
   ex
  </span>
  who kept
  <span class="keyword">
   bothering
  </span>
  him and so he decided to come to Japan to teach English. All during the summer we had plans you know, I would come and visit and that kind of stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were really excited about it and he was a
  <span class="keyword">
   model
  </span>
  at the agency. At the same
  <span class="keyword">
   agency
  </span>
  where I was an actor and... so we had the same agent. He went to Japan and was teaching and we were writing
  <span class="keyword">
   <br>
   back and forth
  </span>
  , &#34;looking forward to seeing you&#34; all that kind of stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was having lunch with my agent one day and telling her that I had started taking Japanese and I had been
  <span class="keyword">
   planning out
  </span>
  my trip. I was very excited about this whole thing and she says, &#34;JJ, I don&#39;t know how to tell you this.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  I&#39;m thinking,&#34;Oh, my God! What?&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  And she says, &#34;Yeah, Richard&#39;s ex-girlfriend
  <span class="keyword">
   flew out
  </span>
  to Japan and they got married.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Oh, my God!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   JJ:
  </strong>
  Married!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Oh, no!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   JJ:
  </strong>
  Yeah! Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  How did you feel?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   JJ:
  </strong>
  Like I needed a
  <span class="keyword">
   ladder
  </span>
  to get on a piece of paper. Really, I mean it was a devastating. You know that first broken-love kind of thing, but..
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jessica:
  </strong>
  Did you hear from him afterwards?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   JJ:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we were always just friends apparently. Yeah, so not only adding the &#34;
  <span class="keyword">
   insult
  </span>
  to the indus..&#34;. What I meant to say &#34;
  <span class="audionotes">
   insult to injury
  </span>
  &#34; was him just saying that we were always just friends.
