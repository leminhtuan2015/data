  Maria
 </strong>
 : So do you believe in love at first sight?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yea, I think it does exist. I think you can have a sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   spark
  </span>
  at first sight, but what I consider as love is a bit different to what that first kind of meeting would be. If you can having something like and then you think that person has a real possibility, I think that&#39;s what you mean by love
  <span class="audionotes">
   at first sight
  </span>
  , but you can&#39;t instantly love someone. It takes growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : It takes coming together, shared experiences and that sort of stuff but, you know, I think for some people, my parents actually met at a guitar concert and it was a total mistake. They thought, no, seriously, it was a total mistake. They thought that each other was in the same group and it turned out they were on separate groups and then things went from there. He
  <span class="audionotes">
   proposed
  </span>
  after five weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : And actually had to, he proposed in front of the fax machine while his divorce was being finalized.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Oh my God.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : To his first wife so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : What a romantic story.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : So, and twenty years later you know, so it took one conversation in a guitar concert so I&#39;ve seen it, you know, I guess that spark definitely exists in them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : I guess if you call it attraction at first sight, it&#39;s way more fitting?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  :Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s what I feel at least. I&#39;ve seen, I have friends who experienced, like one of my friends at my university now, she experienced love at first sight, like she saw the guy and she thought that&#39;s the guy I want to marry. So I never tried anything like that but I heard it happen and I see it happening now because she&#39;s still way
  <span class="audionotes">
   head over heels
  </span>
  for this guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I think if you decide the person that you&#39;re going to marry when you see them, you&#39;re a little bit insane.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Well, insanity is a good point.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I suppose.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  :: She is a little bit insane, yeah. She had a very sad love story beforehand. A guy she was in love with for two and a half years who knew but he didn&#39;t, I think they actually did date a little but he didn&#39;t want to be serious about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : So I guess she&#39;s more, she wants it to be serious but I never tried. Like I think the people I&#39;ve been in love with it has taken time and it&#39;s taken at least half a year before I&#39;ve felt that there was more. Like I could be attracted to them but the love part, the really wanting to be with this person came later because I didn&#39;t want take, I didn&#39;t want to get serious at least immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I think after that sort of six month
  <span class="audionotes">
   puppy love
  </span>
  stage where it&#39;s so new and exciting and you&#39;re learning all about the other person, that&#39;s when it starts to get like I think you start to feel the strong...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : But I mean also like if there was a guy I didn&#39;t even date but we were talking together for half a year and when we met, because it was internet, and he was in Holland and I was in Denmark so we met after half a year. We first met on a trip. So we met and then I could feel it grow but it took me half a year to slowly and safely just get to the point where I could actually feel something. It didn&#39;t work out but...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Ah well, what can you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I tried.
