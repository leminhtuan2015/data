   Josh

  : Hey, Shirley.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Hey, Josh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : So how was your weekend?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Hmm, quite busy this weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Really? Those are hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : So what did you do on Saturday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Well, Saturday morning, I usually clean the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It’s kind of boring, but I have to clean the bathroom and then the kitchen, and then the lounge room because I have lots of cats. And the cats leave hair everywhere. So I always have to clean on Saturday mornings.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Yes, cats are messy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : So after you cleaned, what did you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Well, in the afternoon, I went for a walk up the mountain. It was a beautiful sunny day. There were no clouds in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : It was gorgeous. So I walked up the mountain and I saw a
  <span class="audionotes">
   ferret
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : A ferret?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : They’re a little
  <span class="audionotes">
   furry
  </span>
  animal, four legs, tail—not like a rabbit, but about the same size as a rabbit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : And they’re kind of gold brown color.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Wow, did you see any other animals on your walk?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : No. I didn’t see any other animals on the
  <span class="audionotes">
   ground
  </span>
  . But I did see a beautiful bird flying in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Wow. Do you know what kind?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : I think it was an
  <span class="audionotes">
   ibis
  </span>
  . It’s a big bird that usually walks in the water. It has long legs and it was white with a black head.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Great. So after your walk, did you do anything else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : I went home and then I watched some TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : That was about it for my Saturday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay. What did you do on Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Sunday, I went to the art museum.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Great.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : I really like to go and see new art; pictures or paintings or photographs or sometimes
  <span class="audionotes">
   sculptures
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay. So who’s your favorite artist?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : I don’t really have a favorite artist but I really like watercolors, so pictures that are painted with just soft—a kind of soft painting style.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Do you like paintings of nature?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : I do like paintings of nature. I especially like paintings of flowers and animals and places that have water like lakes or rivers or the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Oh, that sounds like you had a great weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shirley
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it was good. Thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Josh
  </strong>
  : Okay.
