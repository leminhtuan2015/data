The primary suspect in Friday's shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, has been remanded without plea until his next court appearance April 5.
<br><br>
The suspect identified as 28-year-old Brenton Harrison Tarrant from Australia appeared before a New Zealand district court judge and was charged with murder.
<br><br>
Tarrant is suspected of shooting 49 people to death and wounding more than 40 others in two separate incidents in Christchurch.
<br><br>
New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Saturday that her country's gun laws will have to be changed in the wake of Friday's deadly massacres.
<br><br>
"When people, of course, hear that this individual had acquired a gun license and acquired weapons of that range, then obviously I think people will be seeking change, and I'm committing to that."
<br><br>
Ardern said that the nationalities of those affected by the attack include Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Malaysia.
<br><br>
Here in Washington, President Donald Trump said he had telephoned to New Zealand's prime minister to pledge U.S. support.  Speaking at the White House Friday afternoon, the president said the United States would provide whatever help is needed.
<br><br>
"New Zealand has been a great friend and partner for many years.  Our relationship has never been better.  And what they're going through is absolutely terrible.  So our hearts are with them and whatever we can do ...."
<br><br>
Asked by a reporter if he saw an increase in white nationalism, the president said he did not, but it could be an issue in New Zealand.  Trump also said that he had not seen a manifesto in which the suspected gunman praised him as a "symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose."

U.S. President Donald Trump has issued the first veto of his presidency, overriding a congressional measure and protecting his national security declaration to fund a border wall with Mexico.
<br><br>
Surrounded by law enforcement officials as well as the parents of children killed by people who were in the United States illegally, Trump called the congressional action "dangerous" and "reckless."
<br><br>
"Congress's vote to deny the crisis on the southern border is a vote against reality.  It's against reality.  It is a tremendous national emergency.  It is a tremendous crisis."
<br><br>
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate formally rejected President Trump's national emergency declaration to fund border wall construction.  The Senate voted 59 to 41 to disapprove the executive action.  Twelve Republicans joined with Senate Democrats to back the resolution.
<br><br>
Trump's veto sends the issue back to Congress, where it is not likely there will be enough support to override the veto.  A two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate is needed to overcome a presidential veto.

Aviation investigators found a piece of the horizontal stabilizer of the doomed Ethiopian airliner that crashed Sunday.
<br><br>
As Reuters correspondent Julian Satterthwaite reports, the position of that stabilizer was similar to one of an Indonesian Lion Air jet that crashed in October.
<br><br>
The horizontal stabilizer is reportedly set in an unusual position similar to that seen in the wreckage of an Indonesian Max 8 which crashed last year.  The position of the stabilizer could help determine whether the plane was set nose down for a steep dive.
<br><br>
All Boeing Max jets now grounded worldwide because of similarities between the two crashes.  Problems with the plane's software suspected in the Indonesian incident.
<br><br>
Black boxes from the Ethiopian jet are now being analyzed in France.  Initial conclusions are expected in a few days.
<br><br>
In the meantime, Boeing will keep making its best seller, but deliveries to airlines are suspended.

Hundreds of thousands of people marched in protest in central Algiers on Friday in the biggest demonstration against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's 20-year rule since unrest began last month.
<br><br>
No heavy clashes were reported.  But the authorities said 75 protesters were arrested and 11 policemen were slightly injured.
<br><br>
Bouteflika on Monday reversed a decision to stand for another term after weeks of demonstrations against him.  However, he stopped short of relinquishing office and said he would stay on until a new constitution is adopted.
<br><br>
Algerians quickly rejected his [officer] offer, that is, and demanded that he step down.
