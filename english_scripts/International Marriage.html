    Todd:
   </strong>
   So, Mark, um, you mentioned that your wife is Japanese.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   That’s right.
  </font>

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Ok, and how long have you been married?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   We finally got married in April of 1998 but it took us a while to get to that stage.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Ok, well,what’s it like being in an international marriage?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   I really enjoy it. There are different challenges, I mean any marriage has got challenges, and just having different cultures and different backgrounds and different languages, despite the fact that we both speak both our first languages. Yeah, it has different challenges but that makes it fun.

 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   You said that your wife speaks to you in Japanese and you speak to her in English?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   No it’s fifty-fifty really. It really depends on what we’re talking about: if we’re watching an English movie or something on TV in English we’ll speak in English; if we’re reading the Japanese newspaper and we find something interesting we will probably speak in Japanese.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Ok, well, actually, how did you meet?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Through my room mate in Japan, how many years ago now, probably about 15 years ago…
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   A while back
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   …introduced us. Yeah, it’s been a long time.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   That’s cool. Is there anything that’s hard about having an international marriage?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   I suppose it means that you’re always away from one person’s family. I suppose that’s the hardest thing. I’m in Japan now so I’m a long way from my family; when we lived in New Zealand before, my wife was a long way from her family.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   That’s tough, that is tough. So how long did you live together in New Zealand?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   We were there for about 4 years,…I think. Yeah, yeah, approximately 4 years in New Zealand.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Now, have you lived in any other countries together?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   No, no, not together, it’s either been Japan or New Zealand.

 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Do you have any plans as to which country you’re going to settle in?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Now that sounds very permament to me!
  </font>

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So you never know?

    Mark:
   </strong>
   Never know.

   Alright, thanks a lot, Mark.
