  : So Adelina, I guess it&#39;s not polite to ask a girl for her age, but you must be more or less like me, 31, you&#39;re in your early 30s or maybe a bit less?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ade
  </strong>
  : Well I just turned 34.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris
  </strong>
  : Wow! Well you wouldn&#39;t say that. Well, what&#39;s your profession, what do you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ade
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m a translator.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris
  </strong>
  : Oh wow, translator. And how long do you have to study for that,
  <span class="audionotes">
   let&#39;s say
  </span>
  if you want to become a translator, how many years of study is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ade
  </strong>
  : In that time it was five years, but now I think
  <span class="audionotes">
   they cut it one year
  </span>
  , so now it&#39;s only four.

  <strong>
   Chris
  </strong>
  : But you did five?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ade
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I did five plus another year because I did a specialization master.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris
  </strong>
  : Oh right. And you did this in Spain?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ade
  </strong>
  : The master?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris
  </strong>
  : The formation, I mean the study.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ade
  </strong>
  : Well the study, the university, I did it in Granada. It&#39;s one of the best school of translators and interpreters that we have here in Spain. But the master, I did it in London.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris
  </strong>
  : Okay, right. And generally not only university or high school, but generally the education system in Spain, you think it&#39;s good, you think it&#39;s a good system?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ade
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not into that anymore. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good, I don&#39;t like it, no. No, because I think there are so many things that needs to be changed because we need to improve our education system with the time. We are in a technology
  <span class="audionotes">
   era
  </span>
  , okay, so I don&#39;t think they need to learn ... I don&#39;t know, the Second World War, you know, because it&#39;s not useful anymore. So I think there is a lack of languages in Spain. People don&#39;t speak languages at all, so they should focus a little bit more in teaching the kids how to speak another ... more foreign languages, you know. Plus, I think also there is a lack of ... make the kids unique. So you cannot teach everyone the same thing because each person has potential and special skills. So I think the teacher shall be know a lot their students and focus on their abilities and their skills and try to grow them, to make the kid be ... I don&#39;t know, but more talented, more creative and this world will be much better, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris
  </strong>
  : Yeah, it&#39;s true. Parents
  <span class="audionotes">
   only want the best for
  </span>
  their children and they choose for their children. And when you talk about teachers, I mean teachers as well, they don&#39; t... I don&#39;t think they care the most, I mean maybe in their first year, but when they are 10 years in teaching, I don&#39;t think they will really focus on one kid and saying, &#34;Let&#39;s go talk to their parents because this kid really has to do this or that.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ade
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I don&#39;t know, lately I see a lot of news that the children are aggressive and is the poor situation of the teachers,they become like victims. But I think also that if the teenagers are aggressive it&#39;s because they feel lost, they don&#39;t know
  <span class="audionotes">
   what to do with their lives
  </span>
  . And that becomes frustration, and with the frustration comes the aggressive attitude, you know.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Well it&#39;s only now if you look in Spain, as you say, on the other hand people study ... parents put a lot of money in their kids to study and have their diploma and then finally they graduate, but there&#39;s no job or maybe shall we leave that for another time, this discussion?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ade
  </strong>
  : Yeah. But the thing is that it&#39;s too much theory and not practice. So they need to practice what they&#39;re going to do in the future you know. But I cannot save the world, so this is a topic, it really, really get out of my nerves. So yeah, as you said, maybe just stop in this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chris
  </strong>
  : Okay. Well, thank you very much.
