   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hello. I am here with Jade from Korea and we are going to talk about life in the military. So Jade, you were in the army correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I was in the army &#39;til just a year ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, so pretty recently.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  Yeah, recently.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So how did you feel about being in the army. Did you enjoy it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  Yeah being in the army, I enjoyed it. Maybe some other Koreans will really surprised when I say I really enjoyed the military right? But ... because you know we have to go there for compulsory business and
  <span class="audionotes">
   compulsory
  </span>
  service for two years. Two years is very long but to me it was a very
  <span class="audionotes">
   significant
  </span>
  time and very precious time to me. For saying the truth, I am sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   ashamed to say
  </span>
  this but I was 117 kilogram before entering the army.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  117! I can&#39;t believe that! You&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   tiny
  </span>
  . How much do you weigh now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  Now I am 68 kilogram.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh my gosh, that&#39;s half.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  Yes, it&#39;s almost half. When I finished the army just a year ago I was almost 62. I gained 6 more kilograms when I finished the army, now I&#39;m... I get a little bit fat, but I&#39;m still 68 kilograms.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wait a minute, you lost what is that 50 kilograms, 55 kilograms in one year?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  Yeah, in a year, in the army.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh my gosh, 55 kilograms in one year? How did you do it? ... Was it the food, was it the exercise?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  In the army, every day, about the amount of food we ate it doesn&#39;t matter I think I ate more but everyday we ate regularly, like three meals on the exact time and everyday we had to do lots of training(s) like, you know, maybe somebody knows about the martial arts TaeKwonDo, a Korean traditional thing. Everyday we practice that and we ... everyday we practice lots of martial arts and lots of training things for health, so it helps me to lose weight. You know that ??? life is the best way to lose your weight.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  When you came out of the army and you went back home, people must have been shocked?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jade:
  </strong>
  Yeah, everyone was
  <span class="audionotes">
   shocked
  </span>
  , everyone but ... they understood because most of Korean boys when they finish the army, they get changed.
