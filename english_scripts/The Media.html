   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Kerri, I&#39;m going to ask you about the news. Do you
  <span class="audiodef">
   follow
  </span>
  the news everyday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kerri:
  </strong>
  Sometimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How do you follow the news?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kerri:
  </strong>
  Well, in Japan mostly the radio or the internet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. OK. What radio station?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kerri:
  </strong>
  NPR, but on the military station.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. And what internet websites do you listen to?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kerri:
  </strong>
  Well, usually it is just AP news or whatever.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. How much of the news do you think is true?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kerri:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s a tough question.
  <font color="#000000">
   I think that because there&#39;re so many journalists that often what makes into the papers is fairly accurate, but unfortunately some people
   <span class="audiodef">
    leak
   </span>
   information that is untrue to
   <span class="audiodef">
    sway
   </span>
   public opinion, so you have to kind of
   <span class="audiodef">
    weed
   </span>
   through things and consider why that news story is
   <span class="audiodef">
    made public
   </span>
   .
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. How do most people in your country get the news?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kerri:
  </strong>
  I think most people in the states get the news from TV and from the main broadcasting stations. The evening news sort of thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Thanks Keri.
