   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So, Hiroshi, when I go to a sushi restaurant, how do I know what to order?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  It
  <span class="audionotes">
   depends on the mood
  </span>
  I&#39;d have to say cause there is a variety of sushi that you can order. One, I usually think, there&#39;s a fatty, really big flavor sushi which is toro, it&#39;s a fatty part of tuna. Even within the toro, you get o-toro, chu-toro. There&#39;s like several different kinds. It depends on how much the fat part is being contained, so if you want to go for the big flavor, I would definitely go for toro, the fatty tuna.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So fatter is better? For Tuna?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  It depends. Yes, they also have just regular red maguro, which is just the red tuna, with just lean tuna part, so it doesn&#39;t contain any fat. It&#39;s also good, so it depends on you&#39;re mood
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, actually, my dad used to tell me that like you always end with eggs because it
  <span class="audionotes">
   cleanses your palette
  </span>
  , so...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Eggs like chicken eggs?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  Ah, yes, just regular eggs. That tamago eggs, that&#39;s kind of like
  <span class="audionotes">
   scrambled eggs
  </span>
  , but it&#39;s on top of the rice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Oh, that&#39;s the big yellow cube.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  The big yellow one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I know it. OK... So, if I order sushi it&#39;s going to be shellfish or fish or egg? Always?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  You also get some vegetables. Cucumbers, Kanpyo - that&#39;s another type of kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   marinated vegetable
  </span>
  , and also nowadays some sushi restaurants have avocado. That&#39;s actually reverse imported from the United States. The traditional Japanese restaurant never had avocado as a menu, but since the United States, California-style.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  California roll. I know it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  It became very popular, that some Japanese started enjoying the California style sushi, so that you can sometimes get even in Japan nowadays.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  I had one time, in America, I had a Seattle roll which was cream cheese and salmon in rice and seaweed, so really different cause usually there&#39;s not cheese in sushi right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hiroshi:
  </strong>
  : Traditionally, you&#39;d never see cheese in any sushi menu if you go to
  <span class="audionotes">
   old-school
  </span>
  sushi restaurant in Tokyo, probably they&#39;re gonna laugh at you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it did seem a little bit strange.
 </p>
