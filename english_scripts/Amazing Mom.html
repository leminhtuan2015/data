  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : So, Akane, tell
  <strong>
   me
  </strong>
  about
  <strong>
   your
  </strong>
  family. Who do
  <strong>
   you
  </strong>
  get on well with in
  <strong>
   your
  </strong>
  family?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane
  </strong>
  : Well, I think I get along the best with
  <strong>
   my
  </strong>
  mother, I would say.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : So, why is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane
  </strong>
  : Well, I think it probably has to do with the fact that
  <strong>
   we&#39;
  </strong>
  re both female. I mean the only other people in
  <strong>
   my
  </strong>
  family are
  <strong>
   my
  </strong>
  father and
  <strong>
   my
  </strong>
  brother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : So, what does
  <strong>
   your
  </strong>
  mom look like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane
  </strong>
  : Well,
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  &#39;s actually taller than
  <strong>
   me
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
   She
  </strong>
  has dark hair and a pretty firm build. Um,
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  &#39;s not too thin and not too fat, and yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : And what does
  <strong>
   your
  </strong>
  mom do? Does
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  have a job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane
  </strong>
  : Oh, good question.
  <strong>
   She
  </strong>
  &#39;s actually a hair dresser.  Yeah, so
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  does
  <strong>
   my
  </strong>
  hair and
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  &#39;s also an aesthetician as well so I get free skin care products from
  <strong>
   her
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s fantastic. So what does
  <strong>
   your
  </strong>
  mom like to do when
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  is not working?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane
  </strong>
  : Well,
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  used to take sewing lessons, so
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  really likes to sew things like
  <strong>
   her
  </strong>
  own curtains and
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  even made
  <strong>
   me
  </strong>
  some clothes a few times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : Wow, so
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  &#39;s talented.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane
  </strong>
  : Yeah,
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  &#39;s quite artistic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : So when did
  <strong>
   you
  </strong>
  last see
  <strong>
   your
  </strong>
  mom or speak to
  <strong>
   your
  </strong>
  mom?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane
  </strong>
  : Well, the last time I saw
  <strong>
   her
  </strong>
  was this spring. I stayed at
  <strong>
   my
  </strong>
  parents house for about a week and, yeah, that&#39;s when I saw
  <strong>
   her
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : Was that a couple of months ago?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane
  </strong>
  : Yeah, a couple of months ago, that&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : And what was the last thing
  <strong>
   your
  </strong>
  mom bought for
  <strong>
   you
  </strong>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Akane
  </strong>
  : Actually, just before I came here,
  <strong>
   we
  </strong>
  went shopping together and because I have to fly away to a new country
  <strong>
   she
  </strong>
  bought
  <strong>
   me
  </strong>
  some new clothes.
  <strong>
   She
  </strong>
  bought
  <strong>
   me
  </strong>
  a new coat actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth
  </strong>
  : Wow, that&#39;s really nice. Well, thanks for that Akane.
