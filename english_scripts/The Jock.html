  Wow, at what age were you your best?

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What position did you play when you played basketball?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  Guard.  A little bit of forward, depending on what kind of team I was playing on.

  Yeah, were you mainly an
  <span class="audionotes">

  Defensive. Yeah.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Do you still watch a lot of basketball on TV?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conrad:
  </strong>
  Well, now living in Japan I don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   get many chances
  </span>
  to watch the NBA but I do
  <span class="audionotes">
   follow
  </span>
  it on the internet.
