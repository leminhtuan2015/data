   Todd
  </strong>
  : So Meg, you look like a healthy person. Do you eat lots of fruits and vegetables?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I do eat lots of fruits and vegetables, especially fruit. I love to eat fruit because it&#39;s so sweet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah? What fruits do you like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I love bananas because they&#39;re so healthy for you. And so usually, in the morning for breakfast, I&#39;ll have a banana. I also love blueberries. Blueberries are my favorite fruit. But sometimes, they&#39;re expensive so I can&#39;t often eat blueberries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, I agree. Blueberries are so good. I love blueberries in oatmeal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s a good idea. I love to have blueberries in
  <span class="audionotes">
   muffins
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh, that&#39;s nice. Well, you bake. Do you bake blueberry muffins?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I do bake blueberry muffins, and also blueberry bread, blueberry pancakes, many blueberry things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. That&#39;s great. So are there any fruits you don&#39;t like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t like kiwi actually because the
  <span class="audionotes">
   flavor
  </span>
  is okay but the fruits is too soft. So usually, I don&#39;t want to eat kiwi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh well, I love kiwi. I love kiwi and bananas. It&#39;s very good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Hmm, sounds okay but maybe I&#39;ll just have the banana.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So what about vegetables? Are you a person who eats lots of salad?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t eat a lot of salad but I do like to eat vegetables with my meals, usually lunch and dinner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : So you cook vegetables.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : I cook vegetables or I eat vegetables fresh. For example, usually with my lunch, I&#39;ll cut up a cucumber, and put some salt or pepper on the cucumber and eat with my lunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Oh great. I love
  <span class="audionotes">
   vegetable sticks
  </span>
  , so I love carrot sticks, cucumber sticks, radish sticks. It&#39;s very good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Do you like to
  <span class="audionotes">
   dip
  </span>
  vegetable sticks into any dressing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I do but it&#39;s not healthy, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : But yeah, I love the dressing like the ranch dressing with carrot sticks or the ranch dressing with cucumber sticks. It&#39;s very nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s pretty delicious. But you&#39;re right. Not so healthy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : No. So what vegetables do you cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Sometimes I cook broccoli. I actually like to roast broccoli, which is when you put broccoli into the oven and cook it a few minutes. So it&#39;s really delicious. You can add some salt or seasonings and it&#39;s easy to make. You can cook some meat or rice while the broccoli is in the oven and then it&#39;s ready for your dinner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s great. Yeah. You see some vegetables like on a kebab that are roasted. I guess onions are roasted, peppers are roasted.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Right, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Do you roast other vegetables
  <span class="audionotes">
   besides
  </span>
  broccoli?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Sometimes tomatoes, and sometimes potatoes although, it&#39;s that a vegetable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : It is but it&#39;s not a very healthy vegetable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : So maybe I shouldn&#39;t eat potatoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : I love potatoes though. So you roast vegetables, do you cook vegetables any other way? Do you boil vegetables or fry vegetables?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Sometimes I boil vegetables. For example, I like to boil carrots because they&#39;re soft and you can add some spices again to have some flavor when you eat carrots with your meal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Actually, I love carrots but I only like raw carrots.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And I hate cooked carrots.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Oh well, I&#39;ll try to remember that if ever you
  <span class="audionotes">
   come over for dinner
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah. Carrots sticks please.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meg
  </strong>
  : Okay.
 </p>
