   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, now Keren, Hello.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Hello.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I thought we would talk about travelling. Now you&#39;ve travelled to many places, many continents.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Can you talk about some of the places you&#39;ve been to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yes. First of all, I spent about four and a half months in Australia. I suppose
  <span class="audionotes">
   the most amazing place
  </span>
  I went to there was Uluru.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uluru.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Ayers Rock. And it&#39;s just an incredible place which is... the land is very barren and very red and the sky is very blue and it&#39;s just beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, And what&#39;s it called again?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Uluru.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Uluru. OK,
  <span class="audionotes">
   besides there
  </span>
  , anywhere else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve also been to South America. I spent a year in Peru and while I was there I went to Machu Picchu.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Machu Picchu. What is Machu Picchu?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Machu Picchu is
  <span class="audionotes">
   an ancient ruin
  </span>
  of an old Inca town.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you know how old it is?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Probably about seven hundred, eight hundred years old, I think. It&#39;s not actually that old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Huh! That&#39;s interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, any other places?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  I spent quite a lot of time in Spain and the most interesting place I went there was Granada.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Granada.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, what&#39;s in Granada?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  The Alhambra which is the old Muslim
  <span class="audionotes">
   capitol
  </span>
  of Spain. And it&#39;s an amazing old town with Muslim palaces.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And there is just one
  <span class="audionotes">
   palace
  </span>
  or is there many, many palaces?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  There is many, many ruins and there&#39;s a lot to do. You can spend the whole day there walking around the different old buildings that were built in different times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Very cool. So, you&#39;ve seen something in Australia, in South America, in Europe, how about Asia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Asia. I&#39;ve been to Japan and Thailand and Malaysia and Singapore.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And what is you favorite place in Asia?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Keren:
  </strong>
  Hm. It&#39;s a difficult question. I liked Hokkaido.
