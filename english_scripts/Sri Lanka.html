 Hello, Mini.

   Mini:
  </strong>
  Hello.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Mini, you are from Sri Lanka.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  If somebody is going to your country, can you recommend three things they should do or three things they should see?

  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  OK, the first thing is you can go and see the ancient things that all the Kings and Queens built, like castles. We have
  <span class="audionotes">
   a castle
  </span>
  called... it&#39;s called the Rock Castle. It&#39;s called Sigirya, so it&#39;s very beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  This is the Rock Castle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s...
  <span class="audionotes">
   the castle
  </span>
  is on the rock itself, so you can see the ruins there. It&#39;s really beautiful, with pictures, paintings, arts and stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. That&#39;s really cool, so this rock castle, how old is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m not sure, but maybe around two thousand. I&#39;m not sure. Sorry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What else should people you see?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  The second thing should be beaches. We have beautiful beaches
  <span class="audionotes">
   all over the place
  </span>
  , blue, clean. You can swim. You can surf. It&#39;s very beautiful. That&#39;s the second thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Surfing is popular in Sri Lanka?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  M-hm. I mean, not popular
  <span class="audionotes">
   amongst
  </span>
  Sri Lankans but most of the... many tourists come, especially the Germans, they come to my country and surf because the hotels near the beaches are very cheap and it&#39;s very beautiful hotels and very cheap. Food is cheap. It&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. So, we&#39;ve got the Rock Castle, surfing on the beach. Anything else?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  And then a third thing should be the Tooth Temple. It&#39;s like the tooth of a Buddha, so we got it from I guess India, King Ashoka, so it&#39;s one of the things that you can see there. It&#39;s a really beautiful temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, I&#39;m sorry. Can you say the name of that again?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Temple of Tooth Relic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  The Temple of Tooth Relic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mini:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s in Kandy. A place called Kandy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Kandy. OK. Well, thanks for the tips Mini.
 </p>
