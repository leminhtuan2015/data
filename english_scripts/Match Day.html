  Valeria:
 </strong>
 So how about in tournament time?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  How?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  How do you live that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Well if it&#39;s an important tournament, like World Cup or Copa America, we would watch the matches like normally watch and...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  What do you mean normally watch?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Normally watch means
  <span class="audionotes">
   even if
  </span>
  you have classes, even if you are working, if there&#39;s a match in between you&#39;re going to watch it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  So wait a second. If you are working,
  <span class="audionotes">
   suppose
  </span>
  you are working in your office and the matches are three pm meaning like working hours or the match is at ten am like it&#39;s school hours you still watch the match?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah. You get a TV at the office or your classroom and you watch the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we stop working because
  <span class="audionotes">
   otherwise
  </span>
  you wouldn&#39;t do anything anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  So you stop working, you stop studying?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  You
  <span class="audionotes">
   stop everything
  </span>
  that you are doing for watching the match?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s kind of the same in Argentina.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  You see because it&#39;s really important, like football is really important for us so if you&#39;re supporting your team, if it&#39;s your national team everyone gets involved.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Valeria:
  </strong>
  In my country
  <span class="audionotes">
   the rating
  </span>
  of the matches is like more than thirty each time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah, it&#39;s the same in Chile. It&#39;s really successful when you broadcast the match.
