   Diego:
  </strong>
  So, Silvia, I hear you have thirty handbags and thirty-five pairs of shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I know. Actually, it&#39;s a little bit of a sad story if I tell you why I have a lot of bags and shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s OK, we have time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Actually, I love to shop. I don&#39;t know what girl doesn&#39;t love to shop, and I love shopping and so basically how I ended up with all these shoes is because I
  <span class="audionotes">
   broke up
  </span>
  and I was sad and it was like therapy for me to go shopping.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  So it was
  <span class="audionotes">
   retail therapy
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Exactly. So yeah, I just went crazy shopping. For me I don&#39;t know, I just feel good shopping, and the other thing is I like to travel a lot, and when I&#39;m traveling then I also buy a lot of stuff. Like the handbags I have, some are traditional looking bags from Vietnam or Cambodia, Thailand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Different countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  And it&#39;s so cheap.
  <span class="audionotes">
   That&#39;s the thing
  </span>
  . Sometimes I go somewhere and I see everything so cheap that I go crazy shopping.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Wow! But do you really need thirty handbags?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m a girl. Of course I need thirty handbags.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Do you really need thirty five pairs of shoes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Mmm?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  No. That&#39;s quite interesting. Have you ever worn everything?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  You haven&#39;t. OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  No, not yet. And actually last week, I went through ... I was walking and I saw this store had a sale and I went in and as an excuse, it was by birthday last week, so I thought, well, I&#39;m far away from home, and no one gives me any gifts so maybe I should give myself some gifts and I almost used my credit parents credit card, and I thought oh, I will just call them and tell them like hey, happy birthday, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   in the end
  </span>
  , I ended up paying for the stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  OK, that&#39;s good, so you&#39;re a responsible shopoholic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m trying to control it. Actually, before last week, I spend a few months not buying anything, but I
  <span class="audionotes">
   couldn&#39;t resist
  </span>
  the sale.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  But you do know that the sale sign is just cheap marketing, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  No, my God, it was a really good sale.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  No, I think you&#39;re just ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  No, it was a good sale.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  ... a victim of good marketing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Silvia:
  </strong>
  Maybe but still. I&#39;m happy with what I bought so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  OK, so as long as you&#39;re happy, that&#39;s good.
