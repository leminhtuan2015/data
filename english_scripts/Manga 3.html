   Ruth:
  </strong>
  So, Tres, you read a lot of comics. Don&#39;t you find them really violent in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there are violent comic books. There are sexy comic books. There are comic books I wouldn&#39;t show to mygrandmother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  But compared to the comic books in America?
 </p>

   Tres:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think in the United States, first of all, the idea of reading a comic book is a bit different. Adults don&#39;t read comic books as much as they do here in Japan, so if I really wanted to find a violent, or a comic book that had
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/640-1-explicit-content.mp3">
   explicit content
  </a>
  , then I&#39;d have to find a special shop, most likely I would have to be 21 or over, just to get into that shop, whereas here in Japan, just go to your local supermarket and there you are.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Do the comics have any warnings on them for violence?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  In the Unites States? I believe they would, and I&#39;ve never shopped for comic books in the United States, but I think they would have something. What about Ireland? How is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t read a lot of comics myself, but both my brother and sister are quite into
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/640-2-manga.mp3">
   manga
  </a>
  and comics, and I know for Christmas my sister bought my brother a comic called &#34;The Punisher&#34; which was quite violent in places but on the front of comics like that, there&#39;s always a sign that says, &#34;
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/640-3-parental-advisory.mp3">
   Parental Advisory
  </a>
  &#34; to warn people that the contents might be explicit. My cousin also works drawing comics for a living and some of the comics that he&#39;s given to us have been quite violent, but nothing compared to the ones in Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  What do you think about the comics in Japan? Do you ever sit down and read the violent ones or?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t really like violent comics. I&#39;ve read more
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/640-4-girlie-comics.mp3">
   girlie comics
  </a>
  , romance ones instead like Fushigi-yugi and that kind of thing
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  There&#39;s no sexual content in those comics whatsoever?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No, I think they were based for
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/640-5-primary-school.mp3">
   primary school
  </a>
  children. There was no violence at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tres:
  </strong>
  Point in case.
