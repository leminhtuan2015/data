  Winter Vacation

  Akane and Howard talk about their winter vacations.

 <h3>
  Akane&#39;s Vacation
 </h3>
 <p>
  Last year, I
  <strong>
   went
  </strong>
  to Portugal just after Christmas. And I
  <strong>
   stayed
  </strong>
  there until… well, just after New Year&#39;s this year. In Portugal, I
  <strong>
   met
  </strong>
  up with one of my friends from Toronto. He
  <strong>
   had
  </strong>
  family that
  <strong>
   lived
  </strong>
  in Portugal, because his family
  <strong>
   was
  </strong>
  originally from Portugal.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, they
  <strong>
   were
  </strong>
  kind enough to let me stay with them. I didn’t know any Portuguese, except for some simple words like “hello”, and “thank you”. I
  <strong>
   learned
  </strong>
  some simple words through an audio CD, before I
  <strong>
   went
  </strong>
  there. And the people that I
  <strong>
   stayed
  </strong>
  with didn’t know very much English either. However, we
  <strong>
   got
  </strong>
  along surprisingly well.
 </p>
 <p>
  They
  <strong>
   were
  </strong>
  surprised that I
  <strong>
   was
  </strong>
  able to eat some of their exotic foods. They
  <strong>
   made
  </strong>
  some delicious meals every single day, like octopus, tripe and rabbit. It is quite exotic, but I
  <strong>
   thought
  </strong>
  it was quite good. They also
  <strong>
   made
  </strong>
  some excellent desserts, like crème caramel, and a rich sponge cake that they call Paon d’lo.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Howard&#39;s Vacation
 </h3>
 <p>
  OK, now I&#39;ll talk about my winter vacation. This winter vacation I
  <strong>
   spent
  </strong>
  two weeks in my hometown which is Daytona Beach, Florida. It was wonderful. The weather
  <strong>
   was
  </strong>
  warm every day. It was sunny every day and the temperature was almost 80 degrees.
 </p>
 <p>
  I
  <strong>
   visited
  </strong>
  my mother and I
  <strong>
   spent
  </strong>
  every morning having a nice leisurely cup of coffee and reading the newspaper and after that I
  <strong>
   got
  </strong>
  my bicycle out and and
  <strong>
   rode
  </strong>
  down to the beach and enjoyed the sun and the surf, and
  <strong>
   came
  </strong>
  back home and
  <strong>
   read
  </strong>
  a book and went to bed early.
 </p>
 <p>
  I
  <strong>
   had
  </strong>
  a wonderful time. I
  <strong>
   saw
  </strong>
  a couple of new movies, when I was home in Florida. I
  <strong>
   saw
  </strong>
  The Aviator and also an interesting movie
  <strong>
   called
  </strong>
  Spanglish, which I hope you all can see because it&#39;s an interesting movie about English and the Spanish.
