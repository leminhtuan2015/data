   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Tim, you want to talk about road trips?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I wanna talk about road trips.
 </p>
 <p>
  Me and my friends when we were in high school we took a lot of road trips to lots of different places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  We would go down to California sometimes Mexico. One time when I was living in Wyoming, in one weekend we drove from Wyoming through Colorado, New Mexico and Mexico and back in the same weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! Well, actually for people who are not
  <span class="audionotes">
   familiar with
  </span>
  the United States how far is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a long way. I don&#39;t know. It took.. I don&#39;t know, it took probably about 15 hours one way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  So, thirty hours all together. But it was fun. We drove down to Mexico 
                                          had a good night a good meal, a little bit of drinks
  <br>
  and drove back the next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you went to Tijuana?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  No, we went to
  <em>
   Ciudad
  </em>
  Juarez.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  That was really fun and a lot of other trips we took when I lived in Oregon, when we&#39;d go down to California and we&#39;d surf.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Yeah!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, you&#39;re a surfer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  A little bit, a little bit of surfer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. What kind of car do you drive? What do you use for this road trip?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, typical American a
  <span class="audionotes">
   four-wheel drive
  </span>
  vehicle. Big vehicle, lots of gas but a lot of fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh man, you&#39;re from Oregon you&#39;re supposed to be a
  <span class="audionotes">
   tree-hugger
  </span>
  !
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I know. I know. But they&#39;re good. One rule we had on our road trips was any lake or big body of water we had to stop and swim in. It was a good thing to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, you live in Japan now. Do you ever do road trips in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  I took a road trip from Niigata up around Hokkaido and back, so it was a long road trip actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Wow! What&#39;s the difference between a road trip in Japan and a road trip in America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  Well, a road trip in Japan..it&#39;s a little bit more dificult to
  <span class="audionotes">
   get around
  </span>
  , it&#39;s a little bit more expensive. In America road tripping is sort of.. something a lot of people do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  And in Japan, when we do that it is a little bit strange, a little bit different, not  very normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true. OK. Great, thanks a lot Tim.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tim:
  </strong>
  All right.
 </p>
