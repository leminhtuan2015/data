 <strong>
  Paul:
 </strong>
 Hi, this is Paul from England speaking with Katia from Mexico. Today we are speaking about friends and money. Katia, if a friend came to you asking to borrow some money, what would your reaction be?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  If I have a good friend that really needs the money then, of course, if I have the money, I would probably lend it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  So, in what situation would you lend your friend money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Well, for example, it&#39;s a person that is really trying their best to have money and it&#39;s in a situation that it&#39;s an emergency and needs the money then I would lend it. What about you Paul?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I would lend... I would be a little bit nervous to lend a close friend money because I think that money can sometimes
  <span class="audionotes">
   affect a friendship
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  I guess that&#39;s true. Do you have
  <span class="audionotes">
   a bad experience
  </span>
  with it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Actually, I do. Yeah. I&#39;ve had a bad experience of
  <span class="audionotes">
   a very close friend of mine
  </span>
  . He was asking for money from me and at first just once and then twice and then he started asking for more money and it actually had
  <span class="audionotes">
   a big effect on our friendship
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Are you still friends?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Oh, we&#39;re not. We&#39;re not friends anymore, but he did buy his car.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow! This was for a car.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Yeah, he kind of cheated me out of a lot of money, so he was working as well and he was trying to save some money and
  <span class="audionotes">
   <span class="audionotes">
    in the end
   </span>
   he bought his car but he lost his friend.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess that&#39;s very difficult to say, but what about... would you ask for money if you need it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  Personally, I think before I asked a friend for money I would prefer to either ask my parents or my sister. How about you if you were in that situation?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Well, if I had no choice, and not asked my family, I could ask my friend. Of course, he has to be a very good friend and for a very good reason for me to ask for money.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  So could you lend me some money, cause I&#39;d like to go to Hawaii next week?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia:
  </strong>
  Well, Paul let me think about that one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul:
  </strong>
  OK. Thank you.
 </p>
