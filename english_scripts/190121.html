President Trump has strongly criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after she and other Democrats rejected his latest immigration proposal.
<br><br>
Associated Press correspondent Tim McGuire reports.
<br><br>
In a series of tweets Sunday, President Trump says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has moved so far to the left.  She has "officially become a radical Democrat."

Shortly after 9:30 Eastern Time, the Earth will slide directly between the moon and the sun, creating a total lunar eclipse and you won't see another one until 2021.
<br><br>
It will also be the year's first supermoon, when a full moon appears a little bigger and brighter thanks to its slightly closer position.

Expect the eclipsed, or blood moon, to turn red from sunlight scattering off Earth's atmosphere.
<br><br>
Just keep your fingers crossed that the skies above you will be clear.
