   Mark
  </strong>
  : So Sorie, talking about ocean sports and being on the ocean. Maybe you could talk about your ocean swimming experience in Ogasawara.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I love swimming, you know. It&#39;s so peaceful to be there in the ocean. And the ocean in Ogasawara was very clear and you could see so many fishes and I&#39;d love to go swimming and
  <span class="audionotes">
   immersed
  </span>
  in the ocean. It was like another world. It was very beautiful
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="swim-oceab" height="270" src="../../Assets/socialmedia/1328-Sorie-Swim.jpg" width="406">
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was one time—oh, that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : What happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : My friends had come to visit and so, we went fishing. But before they started fishing, I decided to go for a swim. And I swam, and I could see all the way to the bottom of the ocean. And I see this fish but they&#39;re actually not fish, they were sharks. They were white-tipped sharks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : There were four of them at the bottom of the ocean. And I just remember that one you have to do is to keep calm. So I did that. I swam out. I told my friends, &#34;There are four sharks down there, so get me out of here.&#34; So they got me out of there but my heart was
  <span class="audionotes">
   beating
  </span>
  so fast. I was so scared.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Were they dangerous? Those sharks?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Well, they&#39;re not dangerous. They might be able to like bite a finger off but I didn&#39;t want that to happen either. So as soon as I saw them, I came out of the place. Yeah, but that was so scary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Wow. Oh as far, it sounds beautiful and amazing and dangerous all the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s right. So Mark, what about you? Do you have any
  <span class="audionotes">
   encounters
  </span>
  with fish?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : With fish? Well, I remember fish in—don&#39;t you remember when we saw it together? We were swimming in that beach called Kominato, and we swam out around those rocks where we always went. How am I looking a pair of snorkels on it, so peaceful and pretty and like just
  <span class="audionotes">
   tranquil
  </span>
  and I&#39;m looking at all the fish. And then suddenly, that freaky fish, it started at us. Do you remember that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Yeah, with huge eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Huge eyes, and then he started coming towards us.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s right. So in the middle of the ocean, we decided, okay, let&#39;s just
  <span class="audionotes">
   split
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : We were swimming away from it and it was swimming after us, this little fish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : It was very small. It was like 30 centimeters long but they’re really scary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Yeah, we were quite
  <span class="audionotes">
   far out from
  </span>
  the beach and we did split, didn&#39;t we?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : And then what happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : I went that way and you went that way. And just guess which way it went?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : My way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : And it just chased you all the way into the sea, into the beach.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s right. So I was swimming really quickly. I&#39;m trying to get out of the beach and it was very close to me. And I thought it would bite my toes. But it didn&#39;t do anything. But I can&#39;t forget that time that a small fish got me out of the ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : It was so weird, isn&#39;t it, like, fish don&#39;t do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : They don&#39;t. And it was the only fish, like there were no other fish around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Mysterious.
