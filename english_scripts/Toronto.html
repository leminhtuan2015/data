   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey, Marika! What is your home town?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  My hometown is Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, and how many people live there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  About 4 million people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  Mm-hm. It&#39;s the biggest city in Canada.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really. What is the best thing about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  The best thing about Toronto is that it&#39;s a very
  <span class="audiodef">
   multi-cultural
  </span>
  city, and there is a really big mix of different people and there is lots of different things going on and lots of different cultural events and different restaurants and it&#39;s really interesting to meet all the different people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What is the worst thing about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  The worst thing about it is that I
  <span class="audiodef">
   grew up
  </span>
  there so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as exciting as it probably is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  Like sometimes I just get
  <span class="audiodef">
   bored
  </span>
  there because I&#39;m used to it. Is that a bad thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s weird. Let me say that again. What&#39;s the worst thing about it, OK, can I say the worst thing about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  One more time?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sure
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marika:
  </strong>
  The worst thing about Toronto is that it&#39;s expanding and a lot of the farmland that is outside of Toronto is now being
  <span class="audiodef">
   developed
  </span>
  into
  <span class="audiodef">
   condominiums
  </span>
  and suburbs and it&#39;s really good farmland but now it&#39;s just being turned into suburbs which is really bad I think.

  Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, why don&#39;t you talk a little bit about Toronto.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shawn:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a very diverse, multi-cultural city. I feel it&#39;s a great place to raise your family. There&#39;s a lot of great family areas. I&#39;d say some of the shopping malls are very good for pretty much anybody. And for the social types they have many bars in Toronto, unfortunately Toronto has a bit of a homeless problem,
  <em>
   how-should-I-say
  </em>
  , it&#39;s tiresome over the years, like every time you go downtown, you&#39;re bound to bump into a homeless person, like, wha-cha-call-it, for a city of 4 million compared to New York City that does not have a homeless problem it&#39;s pretty embarrassing. Um,
  <em>
   how-should-I-say
  </em>
  ,at times it can be unsafe if you&#39;re around them because you&#39;re constantly being pestered by them, but, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a good city,
  <em>
   how-should-I-say
  </em>
  , many different things to do, you&#39;re just not confined to one area of the city to have fun, you can go pretty much anywhere in the south end of the city and have fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, wow, sounds like a really good place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shawn:
  </strong>
  And of course, a lot of good looking girls in Toronto. Many different kinds so it&#39;s definitely one of those places where you&#39;ll have,
  <em>
   how-should-I-say
  </em>
  , you&#39;ll have neck problems cause you&#39;ll constantly turning your head for all the good looking girls
