Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman this week, a move which raised fears of a broader conflict in the region.
<br><br>
In an interview published in Sunday's <i>Asharq Al-Awsat</i> newspaper, the prince is quoted as saying Iran did not respect Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to Tehran and replied to his efforts by attacking a Japanese-flagged tanker.
<br><br>
The paper also quoted the crown prince as saying his country does "not want a war in the region" but "won't hesitate to deal with any threats to our people, our sovereignty, our territorial integrity and our vital interests."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, crew members of the oil tanker Front Altair, one of two vessels attacked this week, landed in Dubai Saturday.  A company spokesman said the 23 crew members were well-treated by Iranian authorities.
<br><br>
The other damaged tanker, the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous, has been towed to the Emirati port of Fujairah.

At least 10 people were killed and 23 others injured when a car bomb exploded at a checkpoint close to the parliament building in Mogadishu.  The militant group al-Shabab immediately claimed responsibility.
<br><br>
In a separate incident, a car bomb went off on the road to Mogadishu airport but no one was injured in the blast.
<br><br>
In the central Somali town of Galkacyo, 720 kilometers from Mogadishu, nine people were killed in a revenge attack for the Islamist group's killing of a local policeman.
<br><br>

Activists in Hong Kong are calling on residents to continue protests despite leader Carrie Lam's decision to indefinite shelve proposed extradition legislation that would sent all defendants to mainland China for trial.
<br><br>
At a hastily scheduled press conference announced Saturday, Lam told a packed room of reporters the government had "halted" its work on the bill so it could gather more feedback.
<br><br>
"The council will halt its work in relation to the bill until our work in communication, explanation and listening to opinions is completed."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Civil Human Rights Front activist Bonnie Leung said the international community has a stake in this dispute and needs to act.
<br><br>
"... so we urge all the individuals, chambers of commerce, workers, students, who have any related to Hong Kong, you must keep on sending about our situation and keep voicing out not only for the sake of Hong Kong people but also for your own sake."
<br><br>
Another large protest is scheduled for Sunday.

<br><br>
The Mass was held in a small side chapel which was deemed to be safe.

Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli has died at the age of 96.
<br><br>
AP's Ben Thomas reports.
<br><br>
Franco Zeffirelli once likened himself to a sultan with a harem of three: film, theater and opera, and he made it his mission to make culture accessible to the masses.
<br><br>
An inspiration for his films in Shakespeare with his acclaimed 1968 production of "Romeo and Juliet" and 1990 "Hamlet" starring Mel Gibson.
<br><br>
And he also produced operas for television audiences with New York's Metropolitan Opera.
<br><br>
Zeffirelli died at his home in Rome Saturday at age 96.
