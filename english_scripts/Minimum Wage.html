   Todd:
  </strong>
  So Greg, we&#39;re talking about controversial issues and one of the issues in your book is income disparity. So, what do you think about minimum wage?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Minimum wage. Minimum wage I think is very important to have otherwise employers are going to take advantage of people; pay them too little. The society, society itself must decide what is the
  <span class="audionotes">
   proper minimum wage
  </span>
  and that in itself is an issue. What should it be?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You know, actually I disagree. I am actually against a minimum wage. I think that you know, basically all
  <span class="audionotes">
   markets find equilibrium
  </span>
  and that the wage goes too low people just won&#39;t do the job, and so basically, it you don&#39;t have a minimum wage eventually the society will come to a wage where people fell comfortable doing that work. That basically things will work out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   In theory
  </span>
  maybe you&#39;re right, but in reality you&#39;re really wrong. I mean take a look at some of these countries around the world where there are
  <span class="audionotes">
   sweat shops
  </span>
  , where you have children, cause there are no rules regulating labor, and you have children who have never been educated, spend their entire lives working almost like slaves in
  <span class="audionotes">
   unhealthy conditions
  </span>
  . That&#39;s what happens when there are no rules to protect workers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  But I think that&#39;s somewhat true but you said the key word that they&#39;re not educated. I think the problem there is that people aren&#39;t educated and that&#39;s what leads the
  <span class="audionotes">
   abject poverty
  </span>
  that they might do a job like that. So don&#39;t you think that if people were educated more, they would not be willing to work such meaningless jobs, such jobs that pay so little.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Many of those people, those children, who are working like slaves, don&#39;t have a chance for an education and often maybe they&#39;re being exploited, not always but sometimes, by people who&#39;ve had good education.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Take a child in some very poor country has to work just to find food.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So basically, you&#39;re saying they should have a living wage. That they should make enough money that they can have a decent standard of living.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Everyone should have a decent standard of living I believe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I just think that it&#39;s really hard to arbitrarily set a price. I mean that number is always going to go up and down. That even a minimum wage is somewhat skews the reality that if you just let markets take their natural course eventually people won&#39;t be willing to work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  It doesn&#39;t work that way because when you just have a complete free market, you have corrupt people who take advantage of other people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, you know, that actually I do agree with but I think ... I do believe in a free markets but one thing that is true is that free markets cannot work where&#39;s there&#39;s corruption. I do agree with that. So we agree about something.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Greg:
  </strong>
  Yes. Good thing.
