  I had a really good time last night, Thursday night, so I couldn&#39;t stay out that late, but I went over to a friend&#39;s house, an English girl, that I met over here in Japan, where I&#39;m living at the moment, but she&#39;s like the only English girl that I actually know, she&#39;s actually Welsh, but British girl, that I know here, so it&#39;s really nice to sort of hang out with someone who&#39;s similar. She also knows a few friends that I know in England so we&#39;ve
  <br>
  kind of got similar interests. We&#39;re from a similar world in our own country so it&#39;s really nice to find someone who I&#39;m sort of on an equal stepping with here, so she invited me over for the evening. I had a lesson in the afternoon and then after that I got in the tube, she lives about, sort of over an hour away from me by train cause I live in the sort of northeast of Tokyo, actually out of Tokyo in Chiba, and she lives in the southwest, so we couldn&#39;t really be farther away if we tried but she invited me over for a girl&#39;s night in which is something I did a lot with my friend when I was in England so it was really nice and she&#39;s doing, she&#39;s teaching a design course here, interior design, in a Japanese college, and she&#39;s got her own apartment near Shibuya, which is quite a sort of busy nice area of Tokyo. So when I went over it was really nice. She&#39;s got her own little space with a balcony and kitchen something which I don&#39;t have at the moment, cause I&#39;m living in a guesthouse and she cooked for me. Mash potatoes and sausage and onion gravy which is a very typical English dish and so we ate that. We had some wine and then watched a DVD called Twin Towns which is made in Wales and is sort of made us really miss home. We had this sort of very English evening together all together. I had Bangers n&#39; mash , *** a potato and sausage, and um, like English film, and it was really, really enjoyable. It was something I haven&#39;t done here yet and I guess it&#39;s something I really miss cause I really miss my friends from home and hanging out with them and it was nice and then I stayed over. She had like a futon in her sitting room and I stayed over we both got up together this morning to head in for work. I was a little bit late, but, cause of the distance I was having to travel but that doesn&#39;t really matter. I&#39;m usually late for school anyway.
