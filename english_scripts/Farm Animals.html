  : Hey Todd, Did you have any pets when you
                                          were a kid?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : I did. I had many pets actually. I had a
                                          dog, of course, and I had some cats. But actually, I
                                          grew up on a farm. Yeah. So we raised lots of animals,
                                          and on the farm, I always felt like the animals were my
                                          pets. So it was pretty cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Wow. That sounds really exciting for a kid.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Oh, it was great. It was the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : What kind of animals were on your farm?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : We had almost every, you know, farm animal
                                          possible. For example, we had pigs. We raised a lot of
                                          pigs. And pigs actually are really good pets. They&#39;re
                                          very fun. Pigs are very friendly animals and they&#39;re not
                                          really dangerous, so… Also pigs like people.
 </p>
 <p>
  So sometimes when we were little, we would ride on the
                                          pigs&#39; backs but if our grandpa saw us riding on the
                                          pigs, he would yell at us. We always
  <span class="audionotes">
   got in trouble
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Uh-oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Also, aren&#39;t pigs dirty?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : They are dirty. So when you would go in
                                          the
  <span class="audionotes">
   pig pen
  </span>
  , you would get very, very dirty. But, you
                                          know, when you are small, when you are young, you don&#39;t
                                          care. It&#39;s just fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : What about other animals like chickens?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : We did have chickens and lots of chickens.
                                          And the chickens maybe were the least friendly animals.
                                          So chickens don&#39;t like people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : And the chickens – you have to go get the
                                          eggs. So working with chickens was not easy, and I never
                                          really liked the chickens that much. Plus, the chickens you eat
                                          more often, so it&#39;s a little different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Right, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Yeah. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a
                                          chicken
  <span class="audionotes">
   in person
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Oh wow. You must be a city girl.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : I am. Although, when I was young, I always
                                          wanted to have a horse. Did your farm have horses?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : We had one horse for a while, and then we
                                          had a pony. So yeah, we had one horse and we had one
                                          pony. The pony was great because when I was little, we
                                          could ride the pony but the pony was actually really
                                          mean. So the pony would bite you if you were not
                                          careful. And if you tried to ride the pony, sometimes the
                                          pony would get angry, very angry. But it&#39;s okay. You
                                          know, when you&#39;re small on a farm, it&#39;s normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Oh, that pony sounds scary. Were there any
                                          other animals that you had that were more friendly?
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. Actually, the best pet you can have
                                          is a goat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Really? A goat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. Goats are fantastic. Goats love
                                          people. They really, really love people, and they&#39;re
                                          very social. And goats follow people. So when you are
                                          little on the farm and when you walk around, the goats
                                          become your friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  So when I was little, I would walk and I had friendly
                                          goats that would follow me everywhere. And they were
                                          great, and they&#39;re very curious. They like to see what
                                          you&#39;re doing.  And they like to be petted. So, you
                                          know, like how you
  <span class="audionotes">
   pet
  </span>
  a dog, you pet a cat; goats also
                                          like for you to pet them. They&#39;re very, very social.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it&#39;s interesting because goats and sheep are kind
                                          of similar but really, they&#39;re very different. So goats
                                          are very
  <span class="audionotes">
   social
  </span>
  . Goats are very friendly and sheep are
                                          very shy. And sheep don&#39;t like people at all. So sheep
  <span class="audionotes">
   stay away from
  </span>
  people and goats always get close to
                                          people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Hmm, sounds like a goat is a good pet to
                                          have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Goats are the best. They are so friendly.
                                          And goats are cool because goats talk to you. So they
                                          like to make a sound. You know, like, &#34;Baa-a!&#34; They
                                          &#34;baa-a&#34; or whatever, they make a sound. And when you
                                          walk around as a young boy or young girl, the goats are
                                          great. They follow you and you feel like the goat is
                                          talking to you, which is cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : That sounds really fun. Now I wish I had
                                          some goats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : Yeah. Oh, you got to. The only other
                                          animal we had – we also had cows.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd
  </b>
  : And cows are cool. Some cows are friendly.
                                          Most cows are shy. But cows, you know, they always come
                                          to you because they think they will get food. But if
                                          they see you have no food, then cows stay away. So cows
                                          like sheep are a little afraid of people, but pigs and
                                          goats love people and they&#39;re very
  <span class="audionotes">
   social
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Meg
  </b>
  : Oh, it sounds really cool, growing up on a
                                          farm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Todd

  : It was. It was. I was lucky.
