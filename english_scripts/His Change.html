  Maria
 </strong>
 : So Alex we were talking about what I would like to change about myself so I was wondering what would you like to change about, for example, appearance?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : For me I&#39;ve actually had some fun changing my appearance in the past. I have had the craziest hair colors. At one point I was pink, purple and red at the same time. Everything at the same time. I&#39;ve done everything that I can think of, except green, I don&#39;t think green is an appropriate hair color, but I guess in the near future I think I&#39;d want to probably lose about five or six kilos, mainly not so much because of appearance but it will also help me live about ten years longer which would be lovely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : As they say.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yes, as they say. At the moment, you know I&#39;m going to the gym and trying to get that happen. I wish I was a little bit taller, honestly, just a little bit. I&#39;m probably the average height in Australia and I don&#39;t know I think being a bit taller would be good. Yeah, I think that&#39;s probably about it. I&#39;d also, you know everyone wants that body that you can go out to on the beach, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : The beach body?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : The beach body and have the abs. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get
  <span class="audionotes">
   abs
  </span>
  because my
  <span class="audionotes">
   descendents
  </span>
  , my
  <span class="audionotes">
   lineage
  </span>
  is French and Irish and they&#39;re not really known for being abs types. If I was Brazilian, no problem, but the Irish in me makes me more probably rotund, let&#39;s say round, than anything else. More like a rugby player than a surfer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : You weren&#39;t blessed with the red hair but you did get the physique.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m kind of glad for not the red hair. People get teased for that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : I heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Poor gingers. What about character, like what about your personality?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alex
  </strong>
  : I wish that sometimes I had the, let&#39;s say the strength to
  <span class="audionotes">
   cut some people out
  </span>
  when they have become kind of a bit of
  <span class="audionotes">
   a drag
  </span>
  , let&#39;s say. I wish, sometimes I wish I wasn&#39;t so, like I could be a bit more sensible honestly. I can get very, very, very silly so and kind of take things that are not too seriously. School, you know, I find it very, very difficult to like keep going at like at a good pace. I tend to sort of flow in and out of being serious about that. I think steady would be a good thing, I think for me for that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maria
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
