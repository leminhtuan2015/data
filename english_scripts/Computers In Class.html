   Do you have computers in your classroom?

   No and I wish we did I think it would help out a lot of the teachers and a lot of the students to have more of an interactive experience and be able to research things as teachers are talking.

   I&#39;m surprised that you want them. I think they&#39;re a terrible idea. I think they

   Oh but don&#39;t you think it adds to giving a

   especially with accounting or other business related applications that if the teacher is expressing it, if you don&#39;t have a computer you can&#39;t really have a hands-on experience and a lot of the lesson might be lost without actually doing it in the classroom and being able to check your work.

    Tom:
   </strong>
   A lot of what you say is correct but I don&#39;t think you need to do it in the classroom. You can do all of that stuff at home and I think a computer is a very personal and individual activity. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s suitable for a classroom.
