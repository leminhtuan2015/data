Thousands of people gathered Sunday in Bolivar Plaza in Caracas, Venezuela.  They want to hear opposition leader Juan Guaid&oacute; announce when humanitarian aide will be delivered to the crisis-ridden country.
<br><br>

He called on the military to allow the aid into the country.
<br><br>
The United States has said it would transport aid to Venezuela at Guaid&oacute;'s request.
<br><br>

Pope Francis has made dialogue with Islam one of the cornerstones of his papacy.  Since he became pope in 2013, he has visited several countries with large Muslim populations.

Pope Francis was invited by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan to take part in an inter-faith conference.
<br><br>
The pope will spend less than 48 hours in the United Arab Emirates and is due to make only two public addresses during the visit.
<br><br>
Pope Francis released a video message this week ahead of his visit.
<br><br>
He paid tribute to the United Arab Emirates as "a land that is trying to be a model of coexistence, of human brotherhood, and a meeting place among diverse civilizations and cultures, where many find a safe place to work and live freely in the respect of diversities."
<br><br>
The pope will celebrate an open-air mass in Abu Dhabi's Zayed Sports City on Tuesday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Sunday with a delegation of U.N. ambassadors before they visited the Lebanese border, where Israel uncovered Hezbollah infiltration tunnels.
<br><br>
Netanyahu expressed his anger with the U.N.
<br><br>
"In the U.N. General Assembly this year alone, there were 20 resolutions against Israel; six against the rest of the world which includes Syria, includes Iran and so on.  So it's obviously absurd."
<br><br>
The prime minister said Israel would stop all the aggression whether from Lebanon, Syria or from Iran.
<br><br>

President Trump is refusing to rule out the possibility of another partial government shutdown to win congressional approval of funding for a wall along the southern border with Mexico.  He spoke on Sunday in an interview with CBS News.
<br><br>
He also talked about his young son Barron and whether he would let his now 12-year-old son play football.
<br><br>
Associated Press correspondent Tim McGuire reports.
<br><br>
In an interview aired on CBS "Face the Nation," President Trump said he wouldn't steer his 12-year-old son Barron into playing tackle football nor would he stand in his way if he does want to play.
<br><br>
"I just don't like the reports that I see coming out having to do with football.  I mean it's a dangerous sport."
<br><br>
Back in 2017, the president said, "They're ruining the game" with rules changes that made football less violent.
<br><br>
Trump on this Super Ball Sunday, now says he would like to see even more safety changes.
<br><br>
"I thought the equipment would get better, and it has.  The helmets have gotten far better but it hasn't solved the problem."
