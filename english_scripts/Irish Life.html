   Joel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sorry, what was your name again?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  My name is Ruth Archibald.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Ruth. OK, where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from Ireland.

  Ireland. OK. I can notice your

   accent
  </a>
  a little bit. I&#39;ve never been to Ireland before. What&#39;s famous about Ireland that you can tell me about?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Probably the most famous things are Guinness and whiskey, they&#39;re alcoholic drinks from
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s a pretty
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/637-2-rough-crowd.mp3">
   rough crowd
  </a>
  in Ireland too. Is that true for women as well?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t think so. I think it depends on where you go in Ireland. In the capitol, yes, maybe people are a bit more rough, but in the countryside they&#39;re very friendly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  OK, but for men, so if I went to a bar in Ireland, would I be in trouble?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t think so. No. No. It&#39;s really good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  And where are you from?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m from
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/637-3-a-place-called.mp3">
   a place called Bray
  </a>
  , which is maybe one hours drive from the capitol of Dublin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  OK,
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/637-4-a-one-hours-drive.mp3">
   one-hours drive
  </a>
  so what is the geography like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s pretty flat. There are some mountains but none of them are very high and the area around the city is very, it&#39;s very
  <a href="/NotesAudio0601/637-5-built-up.mp3">
   built up
  </a>
  but once you get outside the city it&#39;s mainly countryside. There&#39;s a lot of farming and country, particularly beef and dairy products and also sheep. There&#39;s lots of sheep.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  When are you going to be going back?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve just gone back. I went back in December for three weeks, so at the moment I have no plans to go home in the near future, but maybe sometime in September so maybe in another six or seven weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m going to have to go out and visit sometime.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Definitely. It&#39;s really good. It&#39;s a really nice place to visit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Joel:
  </strong>
  Alright. Thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re welcome.
