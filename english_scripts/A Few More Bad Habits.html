  Mike:
 </strong>
 So Erina, I wanted to ask you what kind of bad habits do you have?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Well it&#39;s pretty tough to know what your bad habits are, you know, because it&#39;s ususally something that other people see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  And I hear a lot and I go to Starbucks a lot and I have to admit that I do go to Starbucks a lot every time I find time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Right. Some people would say that&#39;s not a bad habit but what do you think about that makes it a bad habit?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  I do waste money, a lot of money on Starbucks and I am not a coffee person. I just like to be in an environment where I can just sit down and drink coffee, I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Understandable, you know, especially in Starbucks and other coffee shops it is, they do a good job of creating a nice atmosphere and it makes people want to stay but then having said that,
  <span class="audionotes">
   overspending
  </span>
  is definitely a bad habit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is for sure
  <span class="audionotes">
   a money drainer
  </span>
  to go to Starbucks all the time but people know where to find me so I guess that&#39;s a good thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Yeah, there are always benefits to bad things. Now besides overspending at Starbucks, can you think of any other bad habits that you might have?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Well, I get this from my husband a lot but I touch my hair all the time apparently but I really don&#39;t notice myself doing it so, you know, my husband
  <span class="audionotes">
   fidgets
  </span>
  a lot and he doesn&#39;t notice it and I think it&#39;s one of those things that other people will, you know, point at you, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   point it out
  </span>
  what your bad habits are and for me it&#39;s apparently touching my hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Right, I guess that bad habit is kind of in the same category as fidgeting, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  I think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Although that might be a calming action for you, for other people it looks like you&#39;re nervous or you&#39;re not sure what to say so that might be a bad habit that you could work on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I can work on it by tying my hair up I guess. Very simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mike:
  </strong>
  Well it&#39;s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   simple fix
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Erina:
  </strong>
  Hm, hm.
