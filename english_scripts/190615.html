President Donald Trump said Friday Iran is responsible for crippling two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, raising concerns of a deepening conflict between Washington and Tehran.
<br><br>
Speaking in an interview on Fox News, Trump said the U.S. military had video of Iran's Revolutionary Guards removing an unexploded mine from one of the damaged ships.
<br><br>
"Iran did do it and you know they did it because you saw the boat.  I guess one of the mines didn't explode and it's probably got essentially Iran written all over it." 
<br><br>
Later Friday, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said the United States is trying to build an international consensus on the attacks.
<br><br>
"We had the big push in the last 24 hours to continue to get information out, continue to share intelligence.  And you'll continue to see us work to do that as part of building the international consensus."
<br><br>
Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Friday the attacks violate international norms and he called on Iran to stop what he called "all destabilizing activities."
<br><br>
<br><br>
Amid Democratic outrage, President Donald Trump appears to be walking back his comments about what he would do if a foreign power offered him dirt on a political opponent.
<br><br>
AP's Sagar Meghani has details.
<br><br>
The president says of course he'd look at the information.  "... because if you don't look at it you're not going to know if it's bad.  How would you know if it's bad."
<br><br>
Earlier this week, he told ABC news he would not necessarily tell law enforcement.  This morning on "Fox & Friends," " ... but of course you give it to the FBI or report it to the attorney general or somebody like that."
<br><br>
Democrats had blasted the president's earlier comments, saying he was all but inviting more election interference next year.

A World Health Organization advisory panel decided on Friday not to declare an international public health emergency over the Ebola outbreak in Congo and Uganda.
<br><br>
Dr. Preben Aavitsland of the WHO said the outbreak is localized enough that an international declaration was not necessary.
<br><br>
"It was the view of the committee that the outbreak is a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the region, but it does not meet all the three criteria for a public health emergency of international concern."
<br><br>
Authorities in Uganda where two members of one family died this week from the disease have drawn up a list of 98 contacts or contacts of contacts potentially exposed to the Ebola virus.
<br><br>
A WHO expert told a news conference in Geneva that only 10 of those contacts are considered high risk.  The previous figure was 27.
<br><br>
<br><br>
China's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng summoned Robert Forden, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Beijing Friday, to protest remarks by Washington about Hong Kong's controversial extradition bill.
<br><br>
Le said China did not accept foreign forces meddling in Hong Kong affairs.  He called on the United States to immediately stop all interference in Hong Kong's affairs and stop taking action that would affect the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
<br><br>
About one million people took to the streets of Hong Kong in protest of an extradition law that would send defendants to mainland China for trial.
<br><br>
The protests turned violent earlier this week when people clashed with demonstrators outside the Hong Kong legislature.
<br><br>
<br><br>
And Israeli jets hit Hamas bases in Gaza Friday in response to a rocket fired into southern Israel that damaged a Jewish theological seminary.  Neither side is reporting any casualties.
