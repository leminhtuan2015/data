   I&#39;m going to talk for a few minutes about running because running is something that I really love and also really hate. It&#39;s funny how you can love something and hate something at the same time.

   I like to go running in the park, particularly after a long day at work when you&#39;ve been inside for the whole day it&#39;s really nice to go outside in the fresh air and get some exercise, and after the run is finished you feel so good: You feel really good about yourself and you know that you&#39;ve done something worthwhile and something which is healthy too. Sometimes I like to go to the gym and I like to run on the treadmill, but I think it&#39;s easier to run on the treadmill than it is to run outside on the concrete or on the grass.

  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, Shona, you said that you jog.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m a  jogger too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Oh, are you? Fantastic. How often do you do it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, actually try to go every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. How long for?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Between thirty minutes and an hour, depending on the day. And you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  It depends on the day as well. Today it was only like half an hour, but I try to get out for an hour, maybe like four or five times a week, but I used to be like a lot fitter and I just realized today that I&#39;m not as fit as I used to be, so I&#39;m probably gonna
  <span class="audionotes">
   pump it up
  </span>
  a little bit and do a little bit more, but yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you said you&#39;re not fit. What happened? Did you stop running?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess like I&#39;ve not been doing as much as I used to recently cause I used to do more than just jogging. I went to the  gym as well. I did yoga. You know it was like more of a varied workout, but when you just
  <span class="audionotes">
   stick to
  </span>
  like one exercise alone, like, it tends to kind of make your fitness, like,  drop a little bit if you are used to doing like a lot more sports.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  So I need to vary it a little more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, actually,  where do you run? Do you run on the river?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I run down the river. Just along it, to the right-hand side. Just as far as, like fifteen or twenty minutes, and then back.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, there&#39;s a really nice park near here that has a really nice running trail.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That I highly recommend. Yeah. But you got to take the train, and it&#39;s, you know, a little... it&#39;s four stops. You have to pay a little money, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   it&#39;s worth it
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow. Cool. You&#39;ll have to tell me where it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sure. I can draw you a map.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK, cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How about, when you run, do you have an ipod? Do you listen to music?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Of course, I take my MP3 players, and it&#39;s like, I could not, like, jog without music. On ocassion, I&#39;ve went out the door, like to go for a jog, and I&#39;ve just like, I&#39;ve not been able to. Like I can&#39;t. I need music. Otherwise it&#39;s just so boring, and to be honest, you know, like it depends if it&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   a scenic route
  </span>
  , like
  <span class="audionotes">
   I can cope without music
  </span>
  , like I enjoy listening to the birds or whatever, like it&#39;s beautiful or what, but if it&#39;s like, in the city, or you know, like... I need my music.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, I totally agree. I don&#39;t know what I would do without my ipod. - Um, what kind of music to you listen to when you jog?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  When I jog actually, it&#39;s different music than I listen to normally cause I like with a heavy beat, so I listen to dance music, or some kind of sixties music or something with lots of melody, and I tend to like longer songs as well because it keeps me going longer. If it&#39;s shorter songs then it stops. It keeps stopping. I seem to like lose my pace or something, so I like kind of steady, long beats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, cool, well I&#39;ll be sure to get that map to you. You definitely should go jogging in that park. Cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  What music do you listen to when you go jogging?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually, I listen to also music I normally don&#39;t listen to. I listen to more hip-hop. I&#39;m older, you know, I&#39;m 37, but it definitely keeps me going when I run.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s to do with the beat, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, right. especially when I start. Like I need a couple of good songs to keep me going.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Shona:
  </strong>
  Totally, so, not yeah.
