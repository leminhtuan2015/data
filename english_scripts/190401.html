Comedian and political novice Volodymyr Zelensky defeated the incumbent president, Petro Poroshenko, in Ukraine's first round of presidential elections, according to exit polls on Sunday, leading the two candidates into a run-off election on April 21.
<br><br>
Zelensky plays the role of the president in a television comedy series.  He was projected to win with [30] more than 30 percent of the vote, easily beating Poroshenko, who's been in power since 2014.  He earned about 18 percent of the vote.
<br><br>

Polls have closed in Turkey's nationwide local elections on Sunday, a vote expected to be the toughest for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an, with the control of the capital Ankara and Istanbul at risk.
<br><br>

President Trump is moving to cut aid to a trio of Central American nations whose citizens have been fleeing north toward the U.S. order.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports.
<br><br>
The State Department has told Congress that it's looking to suspend aid payments to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
<br><br>
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney tells ABC's "This Week" "... we need that the northern triangle countries to do more about not allowing their people into Mexico.  They could help us.  We need them to do that.  If not, it makes very little sense for us to continue to send them aid."
<br><br>
But Senator Dick Durbin tells NBC's "Meet the Press" the U.S. should be focused on helping Central America, "where three countries are dissembling before our eyes, and people are desperately coming to the United States.  The president's cutting off aid to these countries will not solve that problem."
<br><br>
And the president is again threatening to close the border with Mexico despite warnings that could create economic havoc on both sides.

Parliament planning another round of vote to try to find an alternative to British Prime Minister Theresa May's separation agreement with the European Union.
<br><br>
AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports from London.
<br><br>
As May has seen her Brexit deal rejected in Parliament three times, not even promising to resign was enough to pass a deal through the third time around although the final time the agreement did fail by fewer votes - 58.
<br><br>
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC the government would need to consider very carefully the will of Parliament though he didn't pledge to support any plan lawmakers might back.
<br><br>
Amid reports May is planning a fourth vote on her withdrawal, Gauke said May is "reflecting on her options."

Pope Francis on Sunday defended his decision to refuse to accept the resignation earlier this month of French Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who was convicted of failing to report sexual abuse allegations to police.

Arab solidarity and joint efforts to confront political and economic crises (were) the main topics of discussion at the 30th annual summit of Arab leaders Sunday in the Tunisian resort town of Carthage.  Iranian behavior across the region, along with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Syrian crisis were also major topics of debate.
<br><br>
Correspondent Edward Yeranian reports for VOA from Cairo.
<br><br>
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi stressed the urgent need to address terrorism.
<br><br>
He says Arab states are facing a critical juncture and must make a concerted effort to combat all forms of terrorism, and its underlying ideology, which kills the innocent, opposes religious beliefs, and ignores principles of human rights.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Thousands of Spaniards gathered in Madrid on Sunday to demand that the government take steps to curb the depopulation of rural areas.
<br><br>
In Spain, 90 percent of the population is now concentrated in 30 percent of the country's territory, namely in Madrid and the coastal areas.  That leaves 10 percent of its people who are spread over large parts of the interior.
<br><br>
On Friday, the government announced measures to improve Internet networks in the countryside.
<br><br>
The march came before Spain's April 28 general election when rural areas could play a key role in deciding if the Socialists stay in power.
