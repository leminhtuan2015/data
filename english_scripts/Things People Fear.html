   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ruth, what is something you are afraid of? Like snakes, spiders, rats?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Probably sharks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sharks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I know that sounds quite irrational, especially when I don&#39;t live near the sea but just the thought of being eaten by a shark. It&#39;s horrific. I really, really, I&#39;m frightened of sharks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Have you ever seen a shark?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Thankfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I think I&#39;d run a mile.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t know really what I&#39;m afraid of, I guess,I don&#39;t like heights too much. Yeah, so. I have to admit that when I&#39;m on a plane I get kind of freaked out, when I fly, yeah. You think, &#34;How is this thing staying in the air?&#34;. You know?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re always happy to land.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah. Always, always, very happy to land, and often when I go home I have to fly across the Pacific and there&#39;s no land so you look out your window and you think, &#34;Ah, if something goes wrong with the plane we can&#39;t land anymore, but that&#39;s very irrational because most accidents I think happen over mountains, so. I think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Although if you landed in the sea, then there might be sharks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s true. How do you feel when you fly?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I quite like flying actually. I quite like it. I mean I&#39;m quite used to flying. I&#39;ve flown to a lot of places. If it&#39;s a long haul flight, i guess it&#39;s a bit boring, but I like the handheld computer you get to play with.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, those are nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  They&#39;re good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, you&#39;re a vegetarian so what&#39;s the food like?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Oh, well the last time I flew I didn&#39;t get any vegetarian food. I think I forgot to tell them, so I had to eat the chicken, whatever.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really, you actually ate the chicken?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  No, I didn&#39;t eat it. I didn&#39;t eat it. I just had it in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I heard that the vegetarian meal are actually better than the chicken or beef meal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Really, they&#39;re quite good, I mean when I&#39;ve had then in the past they&#39;ve been quite good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, here&#39;s to not seeing any sharks in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Absolutely.
