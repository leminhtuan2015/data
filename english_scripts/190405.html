A self-proclaimed white supremacist accused of last month's deadly mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques is to be kept in custody until June 14.
<br><br>
Twenty-eight-year-old Australian Brenton Harrison Tarrant appeared in court via video link at the High Court in Christchurch Friday morning local time.
<br><br>
The judge ordered a mental health assessment of the suspect who appeared from Auckland, New Zealand, where he is in custody.
<br><br>
Fifty people died and many more were injured March 15 when a gunman opened fire at two mosques in Christchurch.

The first official report on the crash of an Ethiopian jet says the crew followed the proper procedures.
<br><br>
Reuters Mia Womersley reports.
<br><br>
A preliminary report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash concludes that the plane repeatedly nose dived before it crashed and has called on Boeing to review the control system of its 737 Max 8 aircraft.
<br><br>
"It is recommended that the aircraft flight control system relative to the flight controllability shall be reviewed by the manufacturer."
<br><br>
At a briefing on Thursday, the Ethiopian minister of transport said the jet was in good condition and airworthy, adding that Flight 302 took off normally at first.
<br><br>
157 passengers and crew of 37 nationalities were killed.
<br><br>

President Trump is floating new ideas for stopping the flow of illegal drugs at the U.S. border with Mexico - put tariffs on Mexican-made cars.
<br><br>
AP's Sagar Meghani reports.
<br><br>
Last week, the president threatened to close the southern border if Mexico did not immediately stop all illegal immigration into the U.S. and later praised the nation for stepping up.
<br><br>
Today, "So we need help from Mexico.  If Mexico doesn't give the help, that's OK," saying he might then put tariffs on cars coming into the U.S. from Mexico, calling it "a very powerful incentive."  "I will do it."
<br><br>
He is also threatening tariffs if Mexico does not stop the illegal drug flow in a year.

Gregory says he will strife to regain the trust of a congregation that became the epicenter of the clergy sex abuse crisis in the United States.
<br><br>

President Trump met today at the White House with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, a sign that the world's two top economic powers could be nearing a trade agreement after marathon talks.
<br><br>
The two countries had originally hoped to reach an agreement by March 1, but even as the negotiations have extended, Mr. Trump and his economic advisers say the discussions are progressing.  Some officials have suggested a deal could be reached by the end of April.
<br><br>
<br><br>
President Trump is expected to veto a resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives today meant to end participation in the civil war in Yemen.
<br><br>
House members voted mostly along party lines in what could be seen as a rejection of the Trump administration's support for the Saudi-led military campaign.
