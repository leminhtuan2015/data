   John
  </strong>
  : So Sarah, what can you tell me about your hometown?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : My hometown. Well, my hometown is called Eau Claire, Wisconsin. And it&#39;s a really great city.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are about 80,000 people. There are lots of things to do. There are three movie theatres. I love to watch movies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : There&#39;s lots of shopping. You can find anything you want there. There are a lot of malls and stores.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Are there many restaurants?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yes. The thing I like is you can eat any type of food. There are Chinese restaurants and Korean restaurants, Italian restaurants. There is a big variety of restaurants, and they&#39;re all good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : That sounds great. What about parks? Are there many places to see nature in your town?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yes. We have a lot of rivers, and lakes and hills. My hometown has four seasons. So in summer, it&#39;s great because there are lots of lakes to swim in, lots of forests to play in. In winter, there is a lot of snow. So you can go ice skating or ice fishing or even skiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Wow. That sounds really fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It&#39;s a really nice city. It&#39;s also really safe. There are lots of nice people there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : Good. Is there much to do at night?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Well, maybe, maybe not. There&#39;s not many things to do at night. There aren&#39;t any nightclubs. There aren&#39;t many bars. So actually, maybe there isn&#39;t much night life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   John
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s okay. It sounds like a nice place to have a family.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sarah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. It is. It&#39;s a great place to have a family. There&#39;s lots of good schools and libraries.
