   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  So, what&#39;s your favorite day. Sorry. What is a perfect day in Montreal? What would you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  <span class="style7">
   <span class="audionotes">
    That&#39;s a great question
   </span>
  </span>
  . The perfect day would start on Sunday. Wake up in the morning. Go to St. Viateur&#39;s Bagels for fresh bagels with cream cheese, then walk over, probably a twenty minute walk over to the Mount Royal which is a big mountain in the middle of the city where
  <span class="audionotes">
   tons of people
  </span>
  come.
 </p>
 <p>
  They have a tam-tam, it&#39;s called tam-tams in the park where people from all over Montreal have drums and do
  <span class="style5">
   <span class="audionotes">
    a big drum circle
   </span>
  </span>
  , turned into a bit of a
  <span class="audionotes">
   flea market
  </span>
  , you can bring the family, you know, lay your blanket down on the mountain and just relax and listen to the drums. You go for lunch at Arahova, which is actually right across the street from 
                                
                                
                                St. Viateur&#39;s
                                
                                Bagels and have delicous s

  , fantastic, and then you just finish off your day
  <span class="style7">
   <span class="audionotes">
    strolling around
   </span>
  </span>
  Prince Arthor Street where they have clowns and outdoor comedians and outdoor musicians and then you go have a cup of coffee somewhere on, around Prince Author street area, outside of course because the weather is beautiful and you finish it off with a nice drink somewhere like Angel or Tokyo bar.
