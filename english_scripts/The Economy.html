  Fanny:
 </strong>
 Hey, Brian, you know, recently I heard that the Canadian dollar is very strong.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  It is.
  <span class="audionotes">
   It&#39;s been amazingly strong
  </span>
  in the last few months.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  What happened? I mean,
  <span class="audionotes">
   how come
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  It went up. The reasons behind why the Canadian dollar is strong...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Very good question.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Without getting too complicated
  </span>
  , my understanding is the Canadian dollar is linked to a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   primary industries
  </span>
  , so things like, say like, oil or mining or timber from like forests and right now I think there&#39;s a high demand for those kind of products, so because of that it&#39;s pushed the Canadian dollar up. But also I think many other currencies have gone down a bit, like the American dollar has dropped a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Really. OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t follow the currency markets too closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  OK, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  But I think because the American dollar has gone down as well, that means that, you know, it doesn&#39;t take as much Canadian money to equal the American money now, so I think those are probably two of the reasons why it&#39;s been strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  I see. I know that Canada is a country which is really rich in the natural resources, but are there still a lot of natural resources left now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s another good question. I think that there are still quite a lot of resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Which is, you know, is good but some of them are decreasing quite a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  I think so, because of
  <span class="audionotes">
   consumption
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s too...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Too big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  And we export a lot of our resources too, so, you know, the Unites States is always taking a lot of our resources so that&#39;s like a huge market right there, but I think there&#39;s still lots of oil but maybe the... some of the trees, you know, they cut them down pretty fast and they take a long time to grow back, so you have to watch out there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  OK, I think that&#39;s a very reason for the strong Canadian dollar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  It could be but you probably should ask an economist. Maybe they can tell you a bit more informed insight than I can.
