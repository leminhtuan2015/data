   So, Mary, what’s in the basket there?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Oh, those are all the Christmas cards I received this year.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   Oh, that’s a lot.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Yeah, it’s quite a few. I had kind of an extensive list for people I would send cards to but in October my hard drive crashed and I lost my Christmas card list, so I had a
   <span class="audionotes">
    hard time
   </span>
   trying to figure out how to get cards to everybody this year, so what I’ve been doing is when I receive a card I’m
   <span class="audionotes">
    cutting out
   </span>
   everyone’s return address and actually
   <span class="audionotes">
    taping
   </span>
   it to the back of their card so that way I’ll have an ability to
   <span class="audionotes">
    rebuild
   </span>
   that list at some point.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   Wow, that sounds like a big project.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   You know it’s really so bad cause I enjoy taking a look at the cards anyhow so it’s something do while
  </font>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   I’m looking at the cards.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   So when do you usually send your Christmas cards out?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Well, I try to send them out in the middle of December but this year they left my house on the 21st, so it was sort of
   <span class="audionotes">
    way too close
   </span>
   to the end.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   Right. Right. Um, what about next year? Will you try to get them out in the middle of December?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   I’m definitely going to try cause now that I have everyone’s address I’ll be able to rebuild that list hopefully before December.

   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   Well, sounds like a good plan. Good luck.
