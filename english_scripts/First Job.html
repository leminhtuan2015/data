   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, Charlotte. You&#39;ve been a teacher for
  <span class="audionotes">
   quite awhile
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Charlotte:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I started about three years ago. My first job was in Jessif, in the east of Poland. I was promised that I wasn&#39;t going to have to teach any beginners or any little children because it was my first job. I was promptly given the beginner infants.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  My first day of teaching I was given a book which said, &#39;Ah! Go into the classroom and say &#34;Hello&#34; to the children and they&#39;ll all say &#34;Hello&#34; back to you and wave. I walked into a class of five four-year olds, followed by all their mothers and grandmothers and I said, &#34;Hello&#34; and they all
  <span class="audionotes">
   burst into tears
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I spent half the lesson
  <span class="audionotes">
   trying to get them to
  </span>
  say,&#34;Hello&#34; to each other and stop them from crying while all the grandmothers stood around and stared at me. I finally
  <span class="audionotes">
   finished off
  </span>
  my singing the whatever Happy Princess Song, all on my own, with crying infants to accompany me. It was one of the worst days of my life. I could
  <span class="audionotes">
   identify with
  </span>
  all the children though, because I wanted to sit on the floor and cry with them by the end of it. I think that that was when I realized that teaching kids was never going to be my vocation. I had some other classes as well but quick soon after that and moved onto adults who cry slightly less. Yeah, that was my first teaching experience. Not the best.

  You mean my official
  <span class="audiodef">
   full-time
  </span>
  first job, talking about!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, sure. How about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  OK. That was right after graduating university. I became a salesman.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oooh, salesman! Nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yep, salesman.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What were you selling?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  I was selling nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nothing
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Nothing. Well, basically I was selling a membership. So, that&#39;s, it&#39;s not something people can see or
  <span class="audiodef">
   visualize
  </span>
  , but it&#39;s like just membership, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Was it like a membership to a country club?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually a private resorts and golf clubs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nice. Was this in Japan or in the US?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  In Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. What was the best thing about your job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Troubles! Cause I have to knock on people&#39;s houses.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow, it was door to door
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Exactly without any appointments and membership costs 5 million yen. Starting, starting costs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  5 million yen to start and you must have been in very rich neighborhoods.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  No, actually we just go to any areas. We just stop off at a station and we start from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really. Were you successful?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s a long story but to be honest with you, how many memberships do you think I sold in a year?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, I don&#39;t know. I will take a guess. In one year, maybe one, two a week, so my guess is, I don&#39;t know, a hundred.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  One!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  One! One!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Can you believe it!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So you must, so you remember the lucky person? Probably still remember that person
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  And you know what, the person who bought my membership, is who? My father.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ooh, that&#39;s a tough job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  It was rough, really. It was really rough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a lot of
  <span class="audiodef">
   rejection
  </span>
  , every day. No, no, no
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  I know, I mean if you think about it, that&#39;s natural though, I mean 5 million yen. and I can&#39;t really show the place, cause I can&#39;t take the person to the place. all I can do is show the picture and speak and that was right after the bubble economy bursted, so nobody had really, nobody had money, so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, man so were you depressed? Were you sad?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  It was very interesting. It was hard to
  <span class="audiodef">
   motivate
  </span>
  myself. The people would call the police, and call me like a robber Yeah, yeah, cause I had to like open the gate and run to the door and stick my leg so that they won&#39;t shut the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Seriously
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s how you do it. Door to door sells.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, that&#39;s, that&#39;s a tough job. I don&#39;t think I could do a job, what&#39;s your job now? What do you do now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  I am, I work for Yokohama city and I am in a place called Yokohama Convention Bureau. It&#39;s a city job.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, so the Yokohama Convention Bureau
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
  OK, so you deal with foreigners, naturally cause it&#39;s in English.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  And travellers and visitors and what have you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you like your job now?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  Interesting! Like I said I meet talk to about over 2,000 people a day, so it&#39;s kind of tiring though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, 2,000 people a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  About 200 people an hour. My office is at the station. Yokohama station. Right out of the gate of the JR, so people are going to
  <span class="audiodef">
   stop by
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You, that&#39;s a lot of talking. You must be tired of talking.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Roe:
  </strong>
  I am tired.

   Todd:
  </strong>
  Lois, what was your first job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  The first job I had was a sales assistant in a shoe shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, shoes
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <a href="../../shop/pro-001-400.html">
    <img src="../../shop/thumbs/promo-image-001-150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" class="floatright">
   </a>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  Shoe shop, yeah! When I was fifteen, I got my first job and I used to work every Saturday for maybe 8 hours a day and I used to earn, 1 pound 77 pence per hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It doesn&#39;t sound like very much
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  No, so in England now, the minimum I think is maybe 5 pounds.
  <br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  So by the time I&#39;d got the bus to Bournemouth,the town, and bought my breakfast at Mcdonald&#39;s, and then gone out for lunch and then got the bus home, I had no money left, but at the time cause I got paid at the end of the month , I always thought I had money, because suddenly all this money would appear in my bank account, but then I would have already spent it all, within the day of work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. So how long did you last at this job?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lois:
  </strong>
  I worked all together I think in three different shoe shops, so the first one I worked in for a year and then that one closed down, so then they moved me to another one, the same company, and then from that one I moved to another one , but then I had to leave my job when I had to do my exams at school cause I needed to study.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Hey, er, Mark, could you tell me about the first job you ever had?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   I think it was when I was at university, well my first long term part time job was when I was at university and one night a week I used to work for 12 hours from 6 pm ‘til 6am in a printing factory and we were actually making television guides to be distributed throughout the whole country.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So you worked from 6am, I mean 6pm ‘til 6am?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Yep, overnight. I felt that it was probably better to work just one long block of time than rather have a part time job 2 or 3 nights a week. So I kept that up for 2, 2and a half years until my final year of university. Then I decided that study on Friday was more important than the part time job, but for 2 and a half years I really enjoyed it.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So for this job what exactly did you do? What were your duties?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   We used to take the TV guides from the printing presses and bundle them up and get them ready for distribution to the various convenience stores and gas stands and bookstores throughout the whole country and then make sure that each or the shops and regions got the right number of guides.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So a job like that would be manual labour, versus say a customer service job where you are always talking with people. Which type of job do you think is more enjoyable for a young person?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   Because of the hours we worked, it was all overnight, there was a combination of other university students and also quite a few housewives who were doing it for extra income, so we actually had quite a good team. There were probably 10 to15 of us. We used to enjoy a good laugh while we were doing it as well.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Sounds fun!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mark:
   </strong>
   It was tiring, especially lectures on Friday mornings but we used to stay awake. I don’t think I ever slept in the lecture afterwards.
