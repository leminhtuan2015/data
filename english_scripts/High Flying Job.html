   Well, basically my father was a pilot and I just got interested in that through him. I&#39;ve always like planes and machines and I thought maybe the best job for me would be to become a pilot.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, that&#39;s cool. That&#39;s really cool. So how do you become a pilot? Like what do you have to do? What&#39;s the process?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   There&#39;s diffent ways of becoming a pilot. First, you can pay for it by yourself. You have to attend school. You have to take tests and eventually you gain your commercial license and then you can apply to an airline company that way. Another way is for you to go directly into an airline company from out of high school, or out of university, and they will train you and it&#39;s all paid for. They actually will give you a salary for the time that they are training you so you are actually going to make money in the time except that the airline will make you work harder.

    Todd:
   </strong>
   Right, right. Still, that&#39;s a pretty
   <span class="audionotes">
    good gig
   </span>
   though.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   It is a really good deal, yeah,
  </font>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   and the third way is to get a private pilot&#39;s license first so you already know the basics of how to fly and then try to get, try to get in a company and then they&#39;ll train you the rest of the way and usually you get a higher salary that way, so.

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   So what way are you doing it? How are you trying to get into Japan Airlines?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Shuan:
   </strong>
   Well, since I&#39;ve already got my private pilot&#39;s license I&#39;m going to try and get in pretty much half way through it, so I won&#39;t need as much training. I&#39;ll probably get a better salary and hopefully, hopefully I&#39;ll actually be able ot fly for JAL.

   Well, good luck. I hope it works out.
