  Gareth
 </strong>
 : So, Rebecca, where are you from?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : I&#39;m from America, actually, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : I&#39;ve never been to America. What&#39;s crime like in America?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : I think it probably depends a lot, city to city. It varies a lot, depending on the city. I actually lived for a while in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Living there, I never actually thought it was unsafe or anything, but looking back, it makes me go like, - We actually lived with that? That&#39;s
  <span class="audionotes">
   insane
  </span>
  ! Like there are certain areas in town you just don&#39;t drive, because if you stop your car in that area, you know, it&#39;s extremely dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : So, what&#39;s the most common kind of crime?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Um, we had a lot of gang problems, a lot of robberies, a lot of guns, and there are a lot of shootings in Albuquerque, especially in the - I can&#39;t remember the name of the area now, but down in this one area, there were a lot. Down in the valley, there were a lot of gang problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Really? What&#39;s the best way to stop it, do you think?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Oh, God, I have no idea. Like the only thing we can say is, you know, - Trust the police to do their job and save us all. But even just that, like to be honest, a lot of the problem in the States come from the fact that we&#39;re allowed to have guns.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Hm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : And as an American, like yeah, it&#39;s part of our, you know, national right to have guns. And if you say, - You can&#39;t have guns, then it would be very
  <span class="audionotes">
   upsetting
  </span>
  , as an American, because it&#39;s like part of, you know, what built the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : But because we have so many guns, that makes crime a whole lot easier to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Yeah. In England, they&#39;ve
  <span class="audionotes">
   banned
  </span>
  guns. You can only keep like a shotgun if you keep your shots away from the gun. But still, they
  <span class="audionotes">
   smuggle
  </span>
  pistols into the country -
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : --and there are gangs that have guns. And if they don&#39;t have guns, they have knives.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Right. So it&#39;s like I think maybe if they were to ban the guns in America, I wonder if it would help or just make it so like the normal people who have these weapons no longer have them, and the bad people who had the - (the bad people), the criminals, or whatever, you know, the gangs - who had the weapons before, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll not have the weapons anymore. I think they&#39;ll still have them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : They&#39;ll smuggle them in. Because they&#39;re doing all these other bad things, why would it
  <span class="audionotes">
   matter
  </span>
  ? So, I don&#39;t know. it just leaves the innocent people a little more defenseless, but I don&#39;t - I don&#39;t know; I really don&#39;t know.
