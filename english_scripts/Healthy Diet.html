  Hello, this is Tara, and I just gonna talk about what I wanna do in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="audiodef">
   At the moment
  </span>
  I&#39;ve
  <span class="audiodef">
   finished my degree
  </span>
  so, I&#39;m just, you know, trying to save some money to
  <span class="audiodef">
   pay off
  </span>
  my debts,                             but I really want to be a nutritionist, so I&#39;m saving some money to go to college.
 </p>
 <p>
  I want to do this job because I don&#39;t think people
  <span class="audiodef">
   take enough care
  </span>
  with what they&#39;re eating nowadays, so I want to teach people to
  <span class="audiodef">
   respect
  </span>
  the food they are eating and to treat their body with care.
 </p>
