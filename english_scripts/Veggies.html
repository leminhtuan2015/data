   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Ruth, now, you are a vegetarian.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what is a good vegetarian dish that you cook?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Well, actually, I&#39;m not a very good cook, so that would be difficult to say. I quite like to make, like a vegetable stew with tofu in it. Things like that, but it&#39;s not very exciting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, how do you make the stew?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Well, firstly, you get all of the vegetable ready and so you chop them up and the potatoes and you boil the potatoes and then you boil the other vegetables, and you fry the tofu with onions and then I think you just put it all together in a pan and stick it in the oven, I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Sounds pretty good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s very easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  What vegetables do you usually put inside the stew?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Oh, thinks like carrots and leaks and courgettes sometimes, mushrooms, and really any vegetables that are in season that I can get hold of.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Courgettes? Is that squash? Zucchini?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I think it might be squash. No, I think it&#39;s zucchini.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Zucchini.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I think it&#39;s zucchini.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, yeah, I think in the states we call it zucchini.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  And you would call aubergine, eggplant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yes. What do you call eggplant?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Aubergine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Aubergine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How do you spell it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Good question. A-U-B-E-R-G-I-N-E.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow. How do you spell courgettes?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  C-O-U-R-G-E-T-T-E
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s pretty good. Now can you spell Zucchini?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Probably not. Z-U-C-C-H-I-N-I.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, maybe that&#39;s it. One more time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Z-U-C-C-H-I-N-I.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think that&#39;s it. Zucchini. I&#39;m not even sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m not either.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what&#39;s your favorite vegetable?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Ah, it has to be broccoli.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I really like broccoli. They look like little trees, there that&#39;s nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true. Yeah, if you just get one broccoli and start eating it, you can&#39;t even finish it. It&#39;s just so big.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Oh, you can. You definitely can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, how do you cook your broccoli?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Just very briefly really because there&#39;s nothing worse than soggy broccoli. You cook it. You boil it in a pan with water only for a three or four minutes. What&#39;s your favorite vegetable?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s a good question. I would have to go with the eggplant and the &#34;aubergine&#34;?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Aubergine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Aubergine. So the aubergine as you call it, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  I think eggplant&#39;s the best. Really, don&#39;t you think they&#39;re sometimes a bit soggy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Actually I kind of like them that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. I like them any way. Although the bad thing about the eggplant is you can&#39;t eat it raw.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ruth:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true. It takes effort.
 </p>
