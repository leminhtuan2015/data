  Todd
 </strong>
 : Hey, Katia, you just lived in Argentina for a year. So can you talk a little bit about why you went to Argentina?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yes. Actually I did think it was a very interesting country, a very good experience for me. I was there for a year and I went there to do an
  <span class="audionotes">
   internship
  </span>
  for five months but actually at the end of the internship, after the five months, they decided to
  <span class="audionotes">
   hire
  </span>
  me and of course I said yes I was very happy to stay a little bit longer in Argentina and learn about Argentina and the Argentinians.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Was this the first time you had lived in Argentina?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yes, first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Now you also come from a Spanish speaking country, so was it easy for you to
  <span class="audionotes">
   adapt
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : Yes, regarding the language of course it wasn&#39;t a
  <span class="audionotes">
   barrier
  </span>
  . I was able to understand and they were able to understand me but I haven&#39;t been in a Latin American country for a while so that was a little bit difficult, but other than that it was not a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Now when you speak Spanish in Argentina, can they
  <span class="audionotes">
   tell
  </span>
  instantly that you are from Mexico?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : They can right away tell that I&#39;m not Argentinian. Some will struggle a little bit to know where I am from. Usually they were in between I&#39;m either Colombian or Mexican.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And for your work environment it was always in Spanish?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : It was always in Spanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Now you speak many languages right? You obviously speak English fluently and do you speak Russian?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : And I also speak Russian.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : That&#39;s because your parents are Russian?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : My mother.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : My mother is Russian and my father Mexican.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : And do you speak any other languages?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : I speak a little bit of Japanese.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Wow. It&#39;s almost like you have one language from every continent.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : No not really. Probably the Arabic is missing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : All right. So Arabic, now you lived in Morocco correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : No, I only visited Morocco.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Katia
  </strong>
  : So I haven&#39;t lived in an Arabic country, nor African.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : OK.
