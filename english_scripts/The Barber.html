 <strong>
  Tu:
 </strong>
 So, Todd, how was your trip to Vietnam?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It was good. It was really good. I mean I had a great time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Is it? Tell me about it? What was the most thing ... what was the thing you remembered most about Vietnam?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, there&#39;s lots of things to remember, maybe too many, it was just great, but I think one thing I thought was special was a haircut. This guy cut my hair on the street, and I had never had that happen before, you know, get my haircut on the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Tell me about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I was at a cafe, a beautiful little garden cafe on the corner, and ....
  <span class="audionotes">
   <span class="audionotes">
    oh, by the way
   </span>
   , your country has amazing coffee.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Really, you think so?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, the coffee was so good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we love it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   So, anyway
  </span>
  , so I come out of the cafe, and there&#39;s this guy and he has a chair and a mirror under a tree and he&#39;s motioning with his scissors for me to come over.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  I see. It&#39;s a very common thing in Vietnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Really, to have barbers on the street?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Barber on the street with the tree and one mirror, one chair only.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Yeah, common thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, it seems pretty unique, so I talk to him and he was trying to convince me to get a haircut and I didn&#39;t know how much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Did you speak English?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  He didn&#39;t speak any English, and
  <span class="audionotes">
   embarrassingly
  </span>
  I didn&#39;t even know numbers in Vietnamese. I didn&#39;t know anything, so I just held out my money, and he pointed to how much the hair cut would cost, and it was quite cheap. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I think he only wanted to charge me two dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Two dollars?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s normal though.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That&#39;s the normal price? And then he sat down and he started cutting my hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  How was it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  It was amazing.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Like
  </span>
  he had all these little tools. He had these little metal tools I had never seen before, and he was cutting my hair and moving about and he was very professional. You could tell ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Were you scared?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, I wasn&#39;t really scared. I thought that maybe, he might chop up my hair, but in actuality, the man was incredibly professional, really really good. Very skilled at his job, and I thought he did a fantastic job on my hair and he also did things that we don&#39;t get like in the states, like he cut my hair and then he shaved of course and then he took out this ear cleaner, these like stuff, and he cleaned my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that doesn&#39;t happen in America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Everyone does that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow, like it&#39;s interesting, cause like in Thailand, I lived in Thailand for many years and what they do it, they massage your head.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, and it&#39;s really nice, so when you get a haircut, they massage your head, but I guess in Vietnam, it&#39;s they clean your ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  Yes,
  <span class="audionotes">
   now that you talk about it
  </span>
  , I think it&#39;s only unique to Vietnamese barber.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So only Vietnamese barber&#39;s clean your ears?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Tu:
  </strong>
  I think so.
 </p>
 <p>
