  Todd:
 </strong>
 OK, so Julia, I thought we would talk about social unrest.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So recently in the news there has been a lot of protest, there&#39;s been some riots and I believe in your country you actually had riots recently.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  We did, yeah, in the summer last year, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  That was in London?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  That was in London and in a few of the other cities around the UK as well. It spread to other cities but mainly centered in London, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So what was your perspective of the riots?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Well we, actually, we were just visiting home and so we just arrived in London right as that all kicked off. So actually I was quite shocked and of course a lot of my friends here were a little bit worried because they knew we were flying into London and London is suddenly all over the news and not in a good way. A lot of violence and quite
  <span class="audionotes">
   shocking
  </span>
  imagines. You don&#39;t think, when you think of London you don&#39;t think of people wearing
  <span class="audionotes">
   balaclavas
  </span>
  and smashing windows and behaving in this violent way.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So it was pretty shocking?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  It was quite shocking but after being there I think within a week it had calmed down and I think the response from the police was very good and from the public was very good and from the media generally it was also very good so it wasn&#39;t such a big deal in the end. It was, it wasn&#39;t a political movement, it wasn&#39;t people protesting anything specific, it was just a kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   unbridled violence
  </span>
  so it didn&#39;t gain any support.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right, so it was just basically kind of releasing maybe youthful
  <span class="audionotes">
   angst
  </span>
  or kind of built up aggression?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Tensions of some, yeah, some kind but because it was all focused around consumer goods and a desire to rob stores of products like shoes and TVs and nobody really took it very seriously. You know, I want a pair of Nikes so I&#39;m going to smash this window doesn&#39;t really gain much momentum as a movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So there was a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   opportunism
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  Absolutely. I think that&#39;s pretty much all it was, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. So now you have the Olympics coming up, do you think it will happen again?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  We do. No, I don&#39;t think it will, no, no. I don&#39;t think so, no. I think around the Olympics there&#39;s an incredible amount of optimism and maybe even national pride.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  No, you know what we can&#39;t say, this is going to air after the Olympics, so I&#39;ll just say do you think it will happen again in the future? Just don&#39;t refer to the Olympics.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So do you think it&#39;s going to happen again in the future?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  No, I don&#39;t think so, no, because of the way the public responded and the way it was handled, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the kind of thing that would
  <span class="audionotes">
   gain momentum
  </span>
  again. I don&#39;t, I think it was a one off.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd
  </strong>
  : Yeah, a one and done deal?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I think so, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well that&#39;s good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Julia:
  </strong>
  I hope so.
