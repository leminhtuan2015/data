  </strong>
  What&#39;s your ideal date situation?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s my ideal date?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Well, I think I would want the guy first of all to make a plan for everything. He should plan the date, and not
  <span class="audionotes">
   rely on
  </span>
  me to make the suggestions because I think it&#39;s very nice and attractive when a guy
  <span class="audionotes">
   makes the first move
  </span>
  and makes the plans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Secondly, I would probably want him to drive me around to the places, or would could go on public transportation together, as long as he has a plan it&#39;s OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  And thirdly, he should pay for the date.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Pay for the date?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Yes, he should pay for the date because it is his pleasure to
  <span class="audionotes">
   take out a girl
  </span>
  on a date. Of course, the date should also be very fun. It should not be boring, and it should end with a kiss on the cheek if it
  <span class="audionotes">
   goes well
  </span>
  . If it doesn&#39;t go well, then the guy should
  <span class="audionotes">
   behave respectfully
  </span>
  and say goodbye.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nick:
  </strong>
  Good luck finding a guy like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cheryl:
  </strong>
  Thank you.
