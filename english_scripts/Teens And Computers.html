   Jeanna:
  </strong>
  Well, I
  <span class="audiodef">
   go on
  </span>
  the computer a lot and I talk with friends through AOL instant messenger. And I just moved from my hometown to Sacremento so it&#39;s a good way to
  <span class="audiodef">
   keep in touch
  </span>
  with
  <span class="audiodef">
   old friends
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah. Do you learn about computers at school or on your own?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeanna:
  </strong>
  I picked most of what I know, I&#39;ve
  <span class="audiodef">
   picked it up
  </span>
  , through, ya know, the years, and some at school, like keyboarding and such.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Do you have a laptop or a PC?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeanna:
  </strong>
  I have a PC. A Compac.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Do you like your computer or do you want a new one?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeanna:
  </strong>
  I want a new one cause I think I
  <span class="audiodef">
   screwed mine up
  </span>
  and it&#39;s a little bit slow now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. How long have you had your computer?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeanna:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve had it for about 3 or 4 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, that&#39;s pretty old for a computer. Yeah, so do you talk to your friends every night by e-mail?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeanna:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yes I do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeanna:
  </strong>
  See going on and you know the gossip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So nowadays, do high school kids talk by e-mail more than phone?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jeanna:
  </strong>
  Most people talk by either e-mail or cellular phone. You know a lot of people don&#39;t use their house phones as much, and a lot of people have cellular phones.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK. Thanks a lot Jeanna.
