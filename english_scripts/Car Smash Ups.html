   Paul
  </strong>
  : So I was on my way to work the other day, and I saw this really—you shouldn&#39;t laugh but it was quite funny traffic accident. I shouldn&#39;t laugh but this old lady was in her car. And bless her, she must have got confused and she put the car into reverse and when she went to like put the car in forward gear, and she drove like straight into the person behind her and smashed up the car behind her.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Oh no.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : I mean, it was an
  <span class="audionotes">
   innocent mistake
  </span>
  but it could happen to any of us but it was a bit, sort of
  <span class="audionotes">
   calamitous
  </span>
  really. How about you? Have you had any car accidents?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Not like that. I&#39;ve been in a car—I was a passenger in a car accident. When I was about 17, my boyfriend at the time was driving too fast on a country road with a national speed limit. So he was going pretty fast and then we were pulling into a small village, so he had to slow right down. The roads were very, very wet. It was dark. He came up over a small hill and there was a big jeep suddenly waiting to turn right and he
  <span class="audionotes">
   stomped on
  </span>
  the brakes and skidded right into the back of it. So his little car just got demolished by this jeep.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were okay. He hit his head on the steering wheel. And I think I had seatbelt pain from where the seatbelt was but yeah, the car was
  <span class="audionotes">
   a write-off
  </span>
  . But we were okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Wow. Thank goodness for that. It sounds like pretty horrific.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : No, no. It was okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : It taught him to, I guess, be a better driver. He was driving too fast on slippery and dark conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Yeah. I guess when you&#39;re at that age, you almost feel like you&#39;re
  <span class="audionotes">
   untouchable
  </span>
  , nothing can stop you. So sometimes, you need those sorts of experiences to kind of make you realize that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Don&#39;t be a boy racer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Paul
  </strong>
  : Don&#39;t be a boy racer and it can be taken away from you. Your life could be taken away from you very easily, you know. It&#39;s pretty—
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Amy
  </strong>
  : Yeah, we were really lucky, for sure.
