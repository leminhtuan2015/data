   Sorie
  </strong>
  : So, Mark, tell us about your experience when you lived in the wilderness.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : It was for a really short time. It was part of a Master&#39;s program, and part of the master&#39;s program was to go into the wilderness, and I guess it was based on a Native American vision quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Very interesting. So what&#39;s a vision quest?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : I guess a vision quest is when you - it&#39;s like a
  <span class="audionotes">
   rite of passage
  </span>
  , like a ritual where you leave where you were, at that place in your life and you enter a space which is kind of fresh or allows for the next stage to manifest almost, so you enter that threshold, that vacant space between and perhaps in that time, you&#39;re gonna, you might have a vision, or you might not but when you come out the other side you&#39;re probably, most likely, going to be a little bit different than when you went into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : So, tell me about the beginning. What was your feeling towards this experience?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Oh, I was super excited. Before I went I … they recommended like not drinking caffeine and things like that, in preparation for going there because … and sugar even because those little things have such control over our every day, that if we&#39;re suddenly fasting when we&#39;re in the wilderness, then if we loose that caffeine and sugar it&#39;s gonna like … maybe get headaches or something like that, so I prepared by dropping the caffeine and the sugar and even before I went, I noticed like clarity coming that wasn&#39;t there even before I went.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : OK, so that was your physical preparation. Did you do any mental preparation?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Yeah, with my wife, I also did a mini-fast, which was for one day
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : OK, and after that, you went to this … the wilderness in Colorado. Can you tell us how this place looked?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : It was dry, and we took a long time to get there in the car. It was about four hours from a place called Boulder, which is a town there. A long drive, lots of fun, talking in the car, singing, and then we arrived  and the air was dry and we had a
  <span class="audionotes">
   dodgy
  </span>
  map and eventually we found the place and it was quite high - the altitude - I can&#39;t remember exactly how high it was but it was quite high, not far from the snow line but it was summer, and it was a forest and we were staying in this Aspen woodland. That&#39;s where we were camping and the land was privately owned so that allowed for security and
  <span class="audionotes">
   peace of mind
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : And how many days were you there?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : In that space camping, on that land in total I think it was ten days of which three and a half were alone
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : And did you have any food? What would you eat every day? and drink?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Well, when we were together - it was about ten, eleven other people - so when we were together with those people, we brought all our own food in, and we were kind of
  <span class="audionotes">
   paired up
  </span>
  , so each pair would make a certain meal every day, and we would eat kind of communally, and in those three and a half days, as part of the vision quest, there was not going to be any eating at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Were you afraid something would happen in the wilderness?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : No, I really like being in the wilderness.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  : Wow, yeah, it sounds very
  <span class="audionotes">
   daunting
  </span>
  really. I wouldn&#39;t be able to do what you did.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : Would you have been scared?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sorie
  </strong>
  :Definitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mark
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t think I would have been able to do it, so I am very happy for you.
