   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  Hey, Lisa, I was hoping you could tell me a little about this cat?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  This is my cat Rocky. Her name... her full name is Rocky Parker, and the reason for that is because she is a survivor and I&#39;ll go into that, how she&#39;s a survivor soon, and also because she climbs the walls like Peter Parker, Spiderman. How we found Rocky, was that our
 </p>
 <p>
  friends of ours lived in this apartment complex. They were walking home one day and they heard this cat
  <span class="audionotes">
   meowing
  </span>
  in the bushes and they stopped and looked for it. They kept on hearing it meowing but they couldn&#39;t actually see where it was. So they started looking for it and it happened that there was a police officer who was in the
  <span class="audionotes">
   general vicinity
  </span>
  and came to help them look for the cat. So they finally found this little kitten who was not more than a month old, had obviously been abandoned by her mother and the police officer explained that because of the animal laws in the community that if they
  <span class="audionotes">
   didn&#39;t take the cat
  </span>
  in or find an owner within a week, they had to bring the cat back to the SPCA, they couldn&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   leave it out
  </span>
  on the street again.
 </p>

  <strong>
   Adrienne:
  </strong>
  What&#39;s the SPCA?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lisa:
  </strong>
  The SPCA is the Society for the Protection of Animals and that controls... it regulates stray animals. It also is a place where you can bring dogs or cats and they are
  <span class="audionotes">
   given away free
  </span>
  to owners, to new pet owners.
