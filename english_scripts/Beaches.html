  Rebecca:
 </strong>
 Hey, Diego.
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Hey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  What are you going to do for summer break?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m thinking about going back home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  To Mexico?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  I will go back to Australia, and I&#39;ll probably go the beach of course because Australia has such beautiful beaches.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Really?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Yes.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Everybody knows that
  </span>
  . On the East Coast. The best beaches. Does Mexico have any beaches?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah. We have really, really nice beaches
  <span class="audionotes">
   down by the Caribbean Ocean
  </span>
  , like in southern Mexico, there&#39;s this beautiful place called Cancun and the Ocean is really, really blue, like
  <span class="audionotes">
   baby blue
  </span>
  , and the sand is white so it looks like snow. It&#39;s a really amazing place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Can you surf at the beach?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m sure you can surf in some places, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  What about snorkeling?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah, definitely. It&#39;s the Caribbean Ocean so the water is transpiring so it&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s like looking at the sky and it&#39;s together with the ocean, ...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Blue!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Well, have you been to the Great Barrier Reef?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve heard about it, but
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;ve heard that
  </span>
  it&#39;s the biggest one in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Well, we have the second biggest one in Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Aaahhhhh! This could be turned into a debate on who has the best beaches.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Maybe so. But what I like about this place called Cancun, is it has a lot of history. Have you ever heard about the Mayan civilization.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s an ancient civilization that was settled in Southern Mexico, so this is where the ruins are they were
  <span class="audionotes">
   very advanced people
  </span>
  . They knew how to predict the eclipses for the next three hundred years, and they just vanished. They just disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  They disappeared?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah! And there&#39;s a new movie directed by Mel Gibson, Apocolypto. It&#39;s about their civilization.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK. No, I haven&#39;t seen that movie at all. Well, I suppose I could go and compare our beaches. Go to Mexico and check out this place. What was the name of it again?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Cancun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Cancun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Well, we could do a home exchange. You can go to Mexico and I can go to Australia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  OK, let&#39;s do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diego:
  </strong>
  Yeah, let&#39;s do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca:
  </strong>
  Great.
