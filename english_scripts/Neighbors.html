   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hello.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Hello. Good morning.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hi. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve met. My name&#39;s Todd.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice to meet you. My name&#39;s Phil. I&#39;m from England.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, hey Phil, I&#39;m from the states. I&#39;ve noticed you in the building. How long have you lived here?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve lived here for six months actually.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;ve been here for two months and I don&#39;t think , you know, we&#39;ve haven&#39;t met yet, so.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I guess we&#39;re always busy at work. I never see you.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Right. Right. Now, do you live on the fourth floor?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, yeah. I live actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   quite near
  </span>
  to your room, just right around the corner.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. What room number are you?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m 443.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, OK. Actually, I&#39;m 430, so.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m lucky my room&#39;s at the end of the corridor so it&#39;s really quiet.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I was wondering
  </span>
  though, at night I do my laundry sometimes and the laundry room is near your room and it makes a lot of noise. Does it
  <span class="audionotes">
   keep you up
  </span>
  at night?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve never heard it
  <span class="audionotes">
   to be honest
  </span>
  . Maybe I&#39;m a really good sleeper.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, good.

  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I never hear it.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, what do you do?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m an English teacher near here.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really, actually so am I.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. I only teach junior high school, so quite young children.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Ah, that&#39;s cool. I&#39;m the opposite. I teach mainly university students.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Oh, OK, yeah. Junior high school students are really good but, quite often they like to sleep in the lesson. Maybe, I&#39;m just a boring teacher. I don&#39;t know.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Nah, nah. I think it&#39;s just cause when they&#39;re young kids. Yeah, the university kids are nice, but I think you have a lot more holidays though.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true. Recently, I had five weeks summer vacation. I was really lucky.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I&#39;m jealous. That&#39;s nice. Hey, so what do you think of the building that we live in?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Actually, I really like it. The rooms are quite small. The atmosphere, everyone is so friendly, and I
  <span class="audionotes">
   get to meet
  </span>
  people from all over the world and talk to them in different languages if I can and it&#39;s really interesting.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I agree. I really like living here. I mean, you know sometimes, I like to be by myself, you know, but I have to admit, I really like having so many people that you can talk to in the building.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it&#39;s really nice and there&#39;s really good places to prepare food and everything is really clean and nice so it&#39;s a really nice place to live.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  How much longer do you think you&#39;re going to stay?
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  My contract is for another six months here, so I will stay that long and then maybe longer, I&#39;m not sure.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  OK, well, anyway it was nice to meet you.
  <br>
  <strong>
   Phil:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah, nice to meet you, too.
