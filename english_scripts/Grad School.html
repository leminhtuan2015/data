   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, Nydja, you actually just got into graduate school. So you know all about the
  <span class="audionotes">
   application process
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  Yes, that&#39;s correct. I just got into grad school. I study International Relations. The process for this school wasn&#39;t too tedious. It didn&#39;t require a GRE or any long essays or too many references. The other schools that I was considering required the tests. High test scores. An application to be submitted three, four months in advance, so the process can be pretty
  <span class="audionotes">
   tedious
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Now, each time that you applied, did you have to pay an application fee?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  Yes, some colleges I was looking at upwards of a hundred and fifty dollars. This one was less expensive. It&#39;s a smaller school.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow! A hundred and fifty dollars!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So that limits how many schools you can apply to?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  Yeah, depending on your funds, so I actually like this program and despite having researched everything else, I chose to stick with this one. I only applied for one and they let me in.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, so you just went solo?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I did. I did. I looked at this college, their plan for international travel and I
  <span class="audionotes">
   fell in love
  </span>
  so nowhere else had this program.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, what&#39;s the school?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  Webster University. The International Relations program.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  And where is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s in Bangkok.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So, you said that for your program, you didn&#39;t have to take a test, like the GRE ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  No, I did not have to take the GRE. No, I haven&#39;t taken it yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  Cause, I&#39;m sure it has a math component that I don&#39;t want to have to worry about.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re not a
  <span class="audionotes">
   math person
  </span>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  No, I&#39;m not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  So the GRE is what, just math and language?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Nydja:
  </strong>
  You know I&#39;m not really sure. I know it&#39;s kind of like the SAT. They want to look at how ... what is your potential when you get to grad school, so I think it does have maybe a composition section, you know,
  <span class="audionotes">
   critical thinking
  </span>
  , math analysis questions with numbers.
