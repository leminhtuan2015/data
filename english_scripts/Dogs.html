   </strong>
   Matt, I&#39;m going to ask you some questions about pets.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Matt:
   </strong>
   OK.
  </font>

   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   First question, do you have a pet?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Matt:
   </strong>
   Yes, my pet at my mom&#39;s house we have  three pets; two dogs and a cat. My family actually
   <span class="audionotes">
    raises
   </span>
   dogs for helping blind people.

   Oh, really?

    Matt:
   </strong>
   Yeah.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Wow, like how do they
   <span class="audionotes">
    train
   </span>
   the dogs?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Matt:
   </strong>
   How do they train the dogs? Well, I mean it&#39;s a long process right? We get them when they&#39;re puppies and so we train them basic. You know, sit, come... really basic things. Then after they&#39;re about two year old they go to a different
   <span class="audionotes">
    training school
   </span>
   .

 <p>

   Yeah!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Well, how many dogs do they usually train at a time?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Matt:
   </strong>
   Oh, just one. We have our own dog and then we have a dog that we have that we are training.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, OK.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Matt:
   </strong>
   Yeah, just one dog at a time.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Do you ever see the dogs you trained like out on the street or anything?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Matt:
   </strong>
   Sometimes we see them. They&#39;ll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets. Yeah, you get to see them every once in awhile.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Oh, wow! That&#39;s cool. Why do people
   <span class="audionotes">
    keep pets
   </span>
   ?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Matt:
   </strong>
   I guess the most important thing is companionship, right? So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, that&#39;s true. OK. Besides cats, dogs and fish, what are some other pets people keep?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Matt:
   </strong>
   Well, I guess if you are Siegfried and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion. I guess all types of things don&#39;t they?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

    Matt:

   I mean, my friend has a snake. I don&#39;t know if you mention that snake, ferrets and insects, spiders...

   <strong>
    Todd:

   OK.

   All kinds of things.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   All right. Yeah, like there is so many. What are some costs
   <span class="audionotes">
    associated with
   </span>
   keeping a pet?
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Matt:
   </strong>
   Food is probably the
   <span class="audionotes">
    biggest cost
   </span>
   . But also if you keep the dog, particularly a dog in your house when they are puppies and we have a lot of puppies they&#39;ll chew up everything they can so we&#39;re constantly replacing shoes and you know, cleaning up pee from the carpet and things like that. It can be a
   <span class="audionotes">
    hassle
   </span>
   .
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Todd:
   </strong>
   Yeah, OK. Thanks a lot Matt. By the way, where are you from?

   This one&#39;s Piper. She&#39;s seven. She just had a birthday in October, and this one&#39;s Daisy, she&#39;s got kind of an older face on her. I think she&#39;s probably about nine years old.

   You know, they could be my children, but they’re actually dogs. Golden Retrievers.

   They&#39;re so pretty.

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Mary:
   </strong>
   Yeah, they&#39;re a lot of my attention. They really have my heart
   <span class="audionotes">
    captured
   </span>
   right now, so I do spend a lot of time, you know, working on them and training them and taking them out for walks during the day and as you can tell by the big giant basket behind you they have a lot of toys so they&#39;re kind of active. They like swinging stuff around and playing outside. (Pipe. Hi, there!).
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   So how did you get them?
   <br>
   I actually raised a Golden Retriever puppy for about 8 years. When I lost her, I remember thinking to myself, I&#39;d love to have another golden retriever but puppies are really hard work, and wouldn&#39;t it be great if I could just find a dog that was already an adult, and I made mention to it to someone at work one day and she let me know of an organization, a rescue organization that worked primarily with Golden Retrievers, so I contacted the organization and they had several dogs available for
   <span class="audionotes">
    adoption
   </span>
   and I went and met a few, and kind of figured out their personalities and decided that there was one there for me, and that was Tucker, my big, big male who I had for a long time, so I ended up adopting him when he was a year and a half. He still had a lot of puppy in him, but he was already
   <span class="audionotes">
    housebroken
   </span>
   , and you know, in pretty good shape for bringing home so he was a lot of fun. That was my first experience with the organization, and they are a great organization. I really believe in a lot of the work they do, because a couple of the dogs, Piper in particular, happen to have been an
   <span class="audionotes">
    abused
   </span>
   animal unfortunately in the first part of her life so this organization spent a lot of time kind of evaluating the right kind of environment for an animal, and the right kind of animal for a family so the adoption process, as they call it, it&#39;s really involved, It&#39;s almost like adopting a child because they want to make sure that you&#39;re home is, you know properly set up for a dog this size and that your yard is fenced and that you can handle a dog like this and have what it takes to train him and get him to trust humans again so it&#39;s been a really long process in some cases. When I adopted daisy, almost two years ago, that was not so hard. She was a very easy dog to adopt. She just came in, made herself at home, got along great with Piper right away and, you know, she has never given me any concern or any reason to worry about her
   <span class="audionotes">
    temperament
   </span>
   . She&#39;s been just such an easy going dog.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
   <strong>
    Adrienne:
   </strong>
   Yeah, she seems like a sweetheart. Both of them are.

    Mary:

   Yeah, they&#39;re fun. They&#39;re fun.

 <strong>
  Lindsay:
 </strong>
 So Jake, we are thinking of getting a dog. What do you think about that?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, that could be a good idea. Dogs can make good companions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lyndsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think so. That&#39;s why we want to get one, but the problem is our apartment is really small. Do you think my apartment is too small for the dog?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  It could be. Dogs can get very lonely too is don&#39;t take care of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   everyone keeps warning me
  </span>
  about the fact that not only is my apartment small but I&#39;m not home a lot and either is my fiance so the dog will be home a lot of the time by itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, then maybe
  <span class="audionotes">
   you&#39;d better reconsider getting one
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lyndsay:
  </strong>
  But they&#39;re so cute and I&#39;ll walk it in the morning and when I come home from work. I mean, do you think that that will be OK for the dog?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, I&#39;m not so sure. Personally, I don&#39;t really see what&#39;s so great about having a dog anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, what! You don&#39;t like dogs?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Not really. I mean, well, first of all, I&#39;m a little bit afraid of them. I think maybe I was attacked when I was very young, but I don&#39;t like them very much.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lyndsay:
  </strong>
  So you&#39;re afraid of them or you don&#39;t like them, or both?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Both. I think also, sometimes they&#39;re kind of dirty inside of the house. They leave lots of pet hair and sometimes they&#39;re not properly
  <span class="audionotes">
   toilet trained
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Well, of course. They&#39;re like babies. You have to train them to go outside, but once they&#39;re trained they can be wonderful
  <span class="audionotes">
   companions
  </span>
  , and I don&#39;t know they&#39;re pretty soft and cute and lovable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the extra work. You have to clean up after them and of course, like you said, you have to train them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lyndsay:
  </strong>
  But a dog will always love you. There&#39;s not another animal that&#39;s like that? That will always love you no matter what. Don&#39;t you think so? Can you think of another animal that will always love you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Cats maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  No way. Cats are so
  <span class="audionotes">
   finicky
  </span>
  . Cats don&#39;t really like you, I feel like. I feel like the dog is there right when you walk in the door waiting for you to come home. A cat is out next door walking on the fence. They don&#39;t care about you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yeah, you&#39;re right. I think dogs are more friendly than cats overall.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lyndsay:
  </strong>
  I think you&#39;re just afraid of dogs because you haven&#39;t had a good experience with a dog, but if I get a dog than you can come to my house and play with my dog.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  I am sure I would like your dog.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Oh, good. OK. So please come to my house and play with my new dog, if I get one. I&#39;m not sure yet.
