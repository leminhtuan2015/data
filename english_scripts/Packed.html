  Jeff:
 </strong>
 So, Jonathan, you are the... maybe the most
 <span class="audionotes">
  prolific traveler
 </span>
 I have ever met, and your home is a suitcase, so how do you
 <span class="audionotes">
  <span class="audionotes">
   live out of a suitcase
  </span>
  like that?
  <p>
   <strong>
    Jonathan:
   </strong>
   I wouldn&#39;t really say my home is a suitcase, but I think that people really hold onto their possessions a little bit too much, and people think that they need to have their favorite books nearby when they probably will never even read it again. I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to have all of those things there, so I don&#39;t need to have a lot of nice clothes with me all the time. I don&#39;t need to carry around all of these souvenirs of
   <span class="audionotes">
    days gone by
   </span>
   . I&#39;m perfectly comfortable having just a minimal amount of things with me. I have changes of clothes so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m in any way suffering from a lack of
   <span class="audionotes">
    personal hygiene
   </span>
   and such things.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Jeff:
   </strong>
   So, but... so what do you do? How do you clean your clothes? What do you do when you want to buy something new?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Jonathan:
   </strong>
   Well, I find that in fact I don&#39;t often buy some many things when I travel. I buy the
   <span class="audionotes">
    necessities
   </span>
   , but I try to keep everything small in size so for example I have one small little pack that has shampoo, conditioner and body soap, and I can in fact, fill it up from a lot of hotels which offer those things to their guests. I can have a little bar of soap. I have a small towel to travel with. I can take my clothes to a coin laundry. At worst, I put on a pair of shorts while I&#39;m washing my two pairs of jeans. If it&#39;s a cold weather country perhaps people look at me a little bit funny, but being Canadian and descended from cold weather countries, I don&#39;t have a difficulty with it.
