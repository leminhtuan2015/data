  Fanny:
 </strong>
 Hey, Brian, what&#39;s the most popular sports in Canada?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  The most popular sport is definitely ice hockey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Ice hockey! So do you play hockey by yourself?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t actually. When I was a kid, I wanted to play ice hockey, and I was always like
  <span class="audionotes">
   begging my dad
  </span>
  and asking him but he always said &#39;NO&#39;.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  I think the big reason is that... Well, he told me it was too expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  It&#39;s not cheap. You know, it costs quite a bit to get all the gear but the big reason I think is the practice was always very early in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Like five a.m. is when the practice is, and I think he was too lazy to wake up and take me to the practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Oh, I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  He told me it was too expensive.
  <span class="audionotes">
   Deep down
  </span>
  I think he was.... he didn&#39;t want to drive me.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  So are there many people playing hockey?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  There are. It&#39;s a great sport. It&#39;s very popular with many children, and maybe high schools and universities all have hockey teams.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Oh, nice. That means you&#39;re a lot of rich people in Canada, then.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Or maybe they spend all of their money on hockey gear. Have you ever played hockey?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  No, no, not really. It&#39;s not that popular in China.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  What kind of sports are more common in China?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  People always play soccer...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Ah, soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  And table tennis. Table tennis is very popular.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  You&#39;re country is very strong at table tennis I think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  We always get all the medals in the big, you know, big events
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Why is table tennis so popular now do you think?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  I think the first reason is that everybody can play it because it&#39;s very easy to get the, you know, the... to get ready for the sports. It&#39;s not expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  No, I guess you just need the ball and the paddle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  The paddle. The ball and the paddle. Yes, and a partner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Right. Right. So have you played it then?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m quite good at it
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Oh, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Because my mother plays very well and so I always played with my mom, so I got better now.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  OK. So she taught you how to play table tennis?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Actually she didn&#39;t teach me but we always played together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   Practice makes perfect
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Brian:
  </strong>
  <span class="audionotes">
   So they say
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Fanny:
  </strong>
  Yeah.
