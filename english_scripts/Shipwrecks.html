  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  So, Peter, I&#39;ve been asking you about hunting for treasure. Can I ask you a few more questions?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  So why are there so many sunken ships in South Africa?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Well I guess around the
  <span class="audionotes">
   southern tip
  </span>
  of Africa because of the really bad weather. It really changes really quickly in those parts and with the ancient ships I guess they weren&#39;t really prepared for that kind of weather, it&#39;s unexpected, so I think that&#39;s probably one reason. And I think one of the other reasons is probably
  <span class="audionotes">
   piracy
  </span>
  , people that were after them, the
  <span class="audionotes">
   loot
  </span>
  I guess if you want to put it that way, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Right, and if it&#39;s so dangerous, how do people find these sunken ships nowadays?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  I think, obviously with technological advances it&#39;s easier to
  <span class="audionotes">
   track
  </span>
  where the, possibly where these sunken ships might be. I think they can use
  <span class="audionotes">
   satellite
  </span>
  <span class="audionotes">
   navigation
  </span>
  and things like that but obviously also finding out more about history and, you know, going through historical records and finding out the old
  <span class="audionotes">
   shipping
  </span>
  <span class="audionotes">
   routes
  </span>
  and possibly where ships got lost and finding it that way, I think, is now, is more easier than it used to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  So it sounds like an interesting combination of technology, science, history...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  I would guess so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Adventure, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  So your friend does this as a hobby. Do you know if it&#39;s very expensive? Is it a big investment to...?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  As far as I remember what he told me and I think it&#39;s really expensive and they formed a little company to start off with but because it involves so much searching and basically doing historical research, also doing a lot of preparation and technological preparation and finding, first tracking, sorry first finding places where possible finds may be and then actually preparing equipment and some of it&#39;s really deep sea diving so it involves, I think, a lot of
  <span class="audionotes">
   initial capital investment
  </span>
  to get it going. Obviously there might be a lot of return when they actually find something but I think in many cases they don&#39;t find as much as they expected so there&#39;s a potential for losing a lot of money so you&#39;d have to have quite a bit of capital investment behind you if you start out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jana:
  </strong>
  Right. So you need a lot of courage and a lot of money?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Peter:
  </strong>
  Yes. But I think he&#39;s an adventurer so he, I think he goes where adventure leads him so it would be a nice job to do I think.
