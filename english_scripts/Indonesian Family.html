  Sunny
 </strong>
 : So, Isthma, your family sounded really interesting, so can you tell me about your family a little bit more?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : Yes, I have a mom, a dad, an older brother, and a younger sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : So, in your family, who likes to read?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : In my family, my dad loves to read. He reads like every day. He reads the newspaper, and he reads books that he has on his shelves, and he buys more. He&#39;s a
  <span class="audionotes">
   researcher
  </span>
  , so he requires reading for his job. The person who doesn&#39;t like reading the most is actually me. I don&#39;t really like reading, because it&#39;s kind of boring sometimes. My dad sometimes gets mad at me if I&#39;m, you know, watching TV, because - It&#39;s a waste of time, and it&#39;s better reading. You, guys, should get knowledge and you&#39;ll learn something from it. So yeah, my dad loves reading.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : Oh, how about cooking?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : Cooking - oh, this is an obvious one. My mom loves cooking. She loves cooking when she was a child. And in her
  <span class="audionotes">
   college days
  </span>
  , I think she won a competition on cooking. Until now, she cooks. Usually, her cookings are very simple, but until now, I don&#39;t
  <span class="audionotes">
   get bored of
  </span>
  it, and it&#39;s so delicious as it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : How about you and other family members?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : Oh, I think I&#39;m the worst, maybe, or my brother, because we don&#39;t really usually visit the kitchen unless we want to get ice cream or some cakes or anything. But I try to help her, at least, in the kitchen when she asks me to. I don&#39;t really
  <span class="audionotes">
   initiate
  </span>
  to go there, but yeah, I think we, my brother and I, would be the worst I think. And my dad, as well; he doesn&#39;t really know where the kitchen is. So, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : And who likes listening to music or singing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : Um, I think I love - my family loves music. We can&#39;t sing, but we do love music. We love listening to different types of music: the classical, pop. But I don&#39;t think my mom would like hip-hop, because it&#39;s not good for her, you know, hearing. But yeah, most of my family members love music. We like watching concerts if we have the chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sunny
  </strong>
  : Okay. What about shopping?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Isthma
  </strong>
  : Shopping - shopping for food would be my mom, of course, because she knows she&#39;s the one that&#39;s going to cook and she knows what ingredient that needs to be bought. However, for clothes, I think it would be me and my brother, because we love shopping. But we help each other a lot in shopping; I mean, if we want to buy our goods, or our necessary
  <span class="audionotes">
   goods
  </span>
  , we usually ask our mom if we can buy it or not, and she usually buys it for us. And yeah, we help each other a lot in the list of shopping.
