  </strong>
  OK, Diana, we&#39;re going to talk about food. You were just talkin about food in Chicago. What kind of good food can you get in Chicago?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  Chicago is famous for its Chicago
  <span class="audiodef">
   style
  </span>
  pizza or their hotdogs. The pizza is
  <span class="audiodef">
   different
  </span>
  because they put the sauce on top I guess, and like they have just
  <span class="audiodef">
   amazinlgy
  </span>
  huge
  <span class="audiodef">
   toppings
  </span>
  like sausages the size of your hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, seriously. Whoa! What other toppings can you find on a pizza?
 </p>

   Dianna:

  Just normal pizza toppings like mushrooms and pepperoni, lots and lots of cheese, tomatoes, feta cheese is my favorite, it&#39;s kind of weird but it tastes good.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  I love feta cheese. Nice. OK. What is your favorite topping?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  My favorite topping on pizza is
  <span class="audiodef">
   weird
  </span>
  but I like pineapple.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dianna:
  </strong>
  Yeah I love it. It tastes good with cheese and sauce.
