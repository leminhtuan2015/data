   Howard:
  </strong>
  Hi, Todd.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Hey,
  <span class="audiodef">
   how&#39;s it going
  </span>
  , Howard? So I heard that you&#39;re
  <span class="audiodef">
   really into
  </span>
  motorcycles.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Howard:
  </strong>
  Ah, yes, I love motorcyles. I&#39;ve been riding motorcycles since I was 15 years old.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, really. Wow! So, what&#39;s the allure of motorcycles?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Howard:
  </strong>
  Freedom. I like the fresh air. I like being out on my own. And I just like the feeling of riding on a bike. It&#39;s like a bicycle without having to pedal and you go a lot faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s for sure. Do you have any good motorcylcle stories?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Howard:
  </strong>
  About 10,000 of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Well, have you ever like taken a special trip on a motorcycle?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Howard:
  </strong>
  I&#39;ve been
  <span class="audiodef">
   all over
  </span>
  the East coast of the United States, from Pennsylvania to Florida on a motorcycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh, wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Howard:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I&#39;ve travelled many times and many different kinds of roads, and taken all kinds of camping trips on bikes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Wow, sounds great. So do you usually travel alone or in a group?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Howard:
  </strong>
  Almost always I go alone. Some guys like to travel together but I found I enjoyed it by myself most of all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Oh really. Oh, wow. Don&#39;t you get kind of lonely?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Howard:
  </strong>
  Never, there&#39;s always a new adventure on every trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Todd:
  </strong>
  Have you ever made any special friends out on the road?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Howard:
  </strong>
  Sure, bikers are like a special kind of
  <span class="audiodef">
   fraternity
  </span>
  . Every biker knows each other, and we&#39;re all
  <span class="audiodef">
   very close
  </span>
  even though we&#39;re not close.
