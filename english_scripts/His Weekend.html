 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well, on Saturday I think I&#39;m going to go to the gym because I haven&#39;t been there for awhile. And then I think I need to clean my house because I didn&#39;t have time during the week, and it is a bit messy now. And in the evening, I think I&#39;m going to have dinner with my friends.

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel

  : I don&#39;t think so. I really want to spend this weekend in a really relaxed way, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going anywhere after dinner.

  <strong>
   Hana

  : I see. How about Sunday?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Daniel
  </strong>
  : Well, Sunday, I&#39;m not going to do anything in the morning. I really want to take - you know - a rest, and then I&#39;m going to have lunch with my family cause I haven&#39;t seen them for awhile, and then in the afternoon, there&#39;s this movie I really want to see, so I&#39;m going to the cinema with my friends.
