 <strong>
  Gareth
 </strong>
 : What do you think?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : I don&#39;t know. A lot of times, I think people who commit crime might commit crime because they want attention, or they don&#39;t get the amount of attention that they feel that they need. They want to be loved, or they want people to
  <span class="audionotes">
   pay attention
  </span>
  to them to know that they existed. You know, - I&#39;m here, hear me roar type thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  And maybe I&#39;ve heard things that sometimes, abortion might actually
  <span class="audionotes">
   potentially
  </span>
  be related to a decrease in crime rate, because instead of having this child that maybe you don&#39;t want, you won&#39;t care for, who will grow up feeling unloved and potentially commit crime, you don&#39;t have the child. So then, it becomes not an option.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Oh, yeah, definitely. Psychologically, when you&#39;re not cared for, and you&#39;re not loved, and no one&#39;s ever said that they love you, that can have a
  <span class="audionotes">
   huge impact
  </span>
  - yeah, definitely. So to go from one
  <span class="audionotes">
   foster home
  </span>
  to another foster home to another foster home, and to have foster parents that don&#39;t really care for you; they just put food on the table, and they clothe you, and they send you off to school, and they never hug you, they never kiss you, that I&#39;m sure will have an effect on people, and kind of maybe lead to more crime.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : But I think another thing that could also be helping is we keep ourselves busy a lot more in the home now because of all the new technology. And you know, you can be online chatting for hours on end, or you could be playing video games. Again, a lot of the media tries to say that, you know, the video games is the cause, but sometimes I wonder if maybe because we&#39;re all at home playing video games, well, if you&#39;re at home doing something else, you can&#39;t be out there causing crimes, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : So sometimes I wonder if maybe that&#39;s related.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Sometimes we don&#39;t even know our own neighbors.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : I once heard this story, I don&#39;t know if this one is true, but if a woman&#39;s - and this might be
  <span class="audionotes">
   inappropriate
  </span>
  - but if a woman is being raped, or someone is going to try and rape her, she should say - Fire!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Fire - yeah. I&#39;ve heard it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Instead of saying &#39;Rape!&#39;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Or - Help!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Because with fire, it will spread, and it will affect others around that place where the fire started. So if someone owns a shop nearby, and they hear someone say - Fire! then they&#39;d be more worried about helping.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Rebecca
  </strong>
  : Yeah, I&#39;ve heard a similar thing. If you actually get in a situation where you need help, scream - Fire! because people come running because that might be immediately a danger to themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gareth
  </strong>
  : Hm.
