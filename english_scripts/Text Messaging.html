  Jake:
 </strong>
 So, Lyndsay do you like to text message a lot on your cell phone ?
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, actually, I text message a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  I don&#39;t do it so much. Sometimes I prefer to just call someone on the phone if
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m in a hurry
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I go both ways
  </span>
  . Sometimes I know I don&#39;t really want to talk to the person. I just want to ask them one question, so it&#39;s so much easier for me just to text them and say, &#34;Are you going to the party tonight&#34; for example instead of calling them, because I know if I call them, I&#39;m gonna have to have a long conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yeah,
  <span class="audionotes">
   I can see what you mean
  </span>
  . Well, usually I get off the phone pretty quickly when I call someone.
  <span class="audionotes">
   I&#39;m not a big talker
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, that&#39;s true, Jake. You don&#39;t talk a lot. But, in general, I like to call people because I think it adds
  <span class="audionotes">
   a more personal touch
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  So are you fast at writing the messages with your thumb?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Well, when I first got a cell phone, which was actually only five years ago, I was so slow, I thought I would never text message, and I always called people, but then people kept text messaging me so I felt obligated to try to learn how to text message, so now, I&#39;m pretty fast actually. What about you?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Actually, I have the opposite problem, where when I first got my cell phone, I thought it was so cool and I had to text message all my friends who had one, and I was pretty fast with my thumb then, but it seems like now I don&#39;t use it so much, and I&#39;ve gotten slower actually.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I think the text message actually is sort of has to do with your age, for example, I text message a lot and I know people younger than me, for example people in high school, they text message a lot, but I asked my father if he text messages, and guess what he said?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  What?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Well, of course, he said he never text messages. He thinks it&#39;s very
  <span class="audionotes">
   juevenile
  </span>
  and unprofessional to text message someone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I can see what he means. It&#39;s usually associated with young people and considered pretty informal to text message someone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, it is really informal, I think, because you&#39;re just using your thumb and you&#39;re trying to write fast. Rarely do you ever write &#39;dear&#39; or &#39;from&#39; or use polite language, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yeah, because you&#39;re using your thumb, you have to write the messages as short as you possibly can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay
  </strong>
  : Right, I mean, it sort of makes sense, when I think that I would never text message someone I didn&#39;t know very well. I only text message people I&#39;m good friends with and comfortable with.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Well, it serves it purpose then, doesn&#39;t it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lindsay:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I guess, I mean it is cheaper than calling someone, but, you know, other times it&#39;s better to call someone, don&#39;t you think.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jake:
  </strong>
  Yeah, definitely.
